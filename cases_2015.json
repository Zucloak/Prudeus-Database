COMMISSION ON ELECTIONS AND JOSEPH EJERCITO ESTRADA, RESPONDENTS.D E C I S I O N LEONARDO-DE CASTRO, J.: Before the Court are (1) a Petition for Certiorari filed under Rule 64, in relation to Rule 65, both of the Revised Rules of Court, by Atty. Alicia Risos-Vidal (Risos-Vidal), which essentially prays for the issuance of the writ of certiorari annulling and setting aside the April 1, 2013[1] and April 23, 2013[2] Resolutions of the Commission on Elections (COMELEC), Second Division and En banc, respectively, in SPA No. 13-211 (DC), entitled \u201cAtty. Alicia Risos-Vidal v. Joseph Ejercito Estrada\u201d for having been rendered with grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction; and (2) a Petition-in-Intervention[3] filed by Alfredo S. Lim (Lim), wherein he prays to be declared the 2013 winning candidate for Mayor of the City of Manila in view of private respondent former President Joseph Ejercito Estrada\u2019s (former President Estrada) disqualification to run for and hold public office.The FactsThe salient facts of the case are as follows:On September 12, 2007, the Sandiganbayan convicted former President Estrada, a former President of the Republic of the Philippines, for the crime of plunder in Criminal Case No. 26558, entitled \u201cPeople of the Philippines v. Joseph Ejercito Estrada, et al.\u201d The dispositive part of the graft court\u2019s decision reads:WHEREFORE, in view of all the foregoing, judgment is hereby rendered in Criminal Case No. 26558 finding the accused, Former President Joseph Ejercito Estrada, GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of PLUNDER, defined in and penalized by Republic Act No. 7080, as amended. On the other hand, for failure of the prosecution to prove and establish their guilt beyond reasonable doubt, the Court finds the accused Jose \u201cJinggoy\u201d Estrada and Atty. Edward S. Serapio NOT GUILTY of the crime of plunder, and accordingly, the Court hereby orders their ACQUITTAL.The penalty imposable for the crime of plunder under Republic Act No. 7080, as amended by Republic Act No. 7659, is Reclusion Perpetua to Death. There being no aggravating or mitigating circumstances, however, the lesser penalty shall be applied in accordance with Article 63 of the Revised Penal Code. Accordingly, the accused Former President Joseph Ejercito Estrada is hereby sentenced to suffer the penalty of Reclusion Perpetua and the accessory penalties of civil interdiction during the period of sentence and perpetual absolute disqualification.The period within which accused Former President Joseph Ejercito Estrada has been under detention shall be credited to him in full as long as he agrees voluntarily in writing to abide by the same disciplinary rules imposed upon convicted prisoners.Moreover, in accordance with Section 2 of Republic Act No. 7080, as amended by Republic Act No. 7659, the Court hereby declares the forfeiture in favor of the government of the following:(1) The total amount of Five Hundred Forty[-]Two Million Seven Hundred Ninety[-]One Thousand Pesos (P545,291,000.00), with interest and income earned, inclusive of the amount of Two Hundred Million Pesos (P200,000,000.00), deposited in the name and account of the Erap Muslim Youth Foundation.(2) The amount of One Hundred Eighty[-]Nine Million Pesos (P189,000,000.00), inclusive of interests and income earned, deposited in the Jose Velarde account.(3) The real property consisting of a house and lot dubbed as \u201cBoracay Mansion\u201d located at #100 11th Street, New Manila, Quezon City.The cash bonds posted by accused Jose \u201cJinggoy\u201d Estrada and Atty. Edward S. Serapio are hereby ordered cancelled and released to the said accused or their duly authorized representatives upon presentation of the original receipt evidencing payment thereof and subject to the usual accounting and auditing procedures. Likewise, the hold-departure orders issued against the said accused are hereby recalled and declared functus oficio.[4]On October 25, 2007, however, former President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo (former President Arroyo) extended executive clemency, by way of pardon, to former President Estrada. The full text of said pardon states:MALACA\u00d1AN PALACEMANILA____________________________________________________By the President of the PhilippinesPARDON_____________________________________________________WHEREAS, this Administration has a policy of releasing inmates who have reached the age of seventy (70),WHEREAS, Joseph Ejercito Estrada has been under detention for six and a half years,WHEREAS, Joseph Ejercito Estrada has publicly committed to no longer seek any elective position or office,IN VIEW HEREOF and pursuant to the authority conferred upon me by the Constitution, I hereby grant executive clemency to JOSEPH EJERCITO ESTRADA, convicted by the Sandiganbayan of Plunder and imposed a penalty of Reclusion Perpetua. He is hereby restored to his civil and political rights.The forfeitures imposed by the Sandiganbayan remain in force and in full, including all writs and processes issued by the Sandiganbayan in pursuance hereof, except for the bank account(s) he owned before his tenure as President.Upon acceptance of this pardon by JOSEPH EJERCITO ESTRADA, this pardon shall take effect.Given under my hand at the City of Manila, this 25th Day of October, in the year of Our Lord, two thousand and seven.Gloria M. Arroyo (sgd.)By the President:IGNACIO R. BUNYE (sgd.)Acting Executive Secretary[5]On October 26, 2007, at 3:35 p.m., former President Estrada \u201creceived and accepted\u201d[6] the pardon by affixing his signature beside his handwritten notation thereon.On November 30, 2009, former President Estrada filed a Certificate of Candidacy[7] for the position of President. During that time, his candidacy earned three oppositions in the COMELEC: (1) SPA No. 09-024 (DC), a \u201cPetition to Deny Due Course and Cancel Certificate of Candidacy\u201d filed by Rev. Elly Velez B. Lao Pamatong, ESQ; (2) SPA No. 09-028 (DC), a petition for \u201cDisqualification as Presidential Candidate\u201d filed by Evilio C. Pormento (Pormento); and (3) SPA No. 09-104 (DC), a \u201cPetition to Disqualify Estrada Ejercito, Joseph M. from Running as President due to Constitutional Disqualification and Creating Confusion to the Prejudice of Estrada, Mary Lou B\u201d filed by Mary Lou Estrada. In separate Resolutions[8] dated January 20, 2010 by the COMELEC, Second Division, however, all three petitions were effectively dismissed on the uniform grounds that (i) the Constitutional proscription on reelection applies to a sitting president; and (ii) the pardon granted to former President Estrada by former President Arroyo restored the former\u2019s right to vote and be voted for a public office. The subsequent motions for reconsideration thereto were denied by the COMELEC En banc.After the conduct of the May 10, 2010 synchronized elections, however, former President Estrada only managed to garner the second highest number of votes.Of the three petitioners above-mentioned, only Pormento sought recourse to this Court and filed a petition for certiorari, which was docketed as G.R. No. 191988, entitled \u201cAtty. Evilio C. Pormento v. Joseph \u2018ERAP\u2019 Ejercito Estrada and Commission on Elections.\u201d But in a Resolution[9] dated August 31, 2010, the Court dismissed the aforementioned petition on the ground of mootness considering that former President Estrada lost his presidential bid.On October 2, 2012, former President Estrada once more ventured into the political arena, and filed a Certificate of Candidacy,[10] this time vying for a local elective post, that of the Mayor of the City of Manila.On January 24, 2013, Risos-Vidal, the petitioner in this case, filed a Petition for Disqualification against former President Estrada before the COMELEC. The petition was docketed as SPA No. 13-211 (DC). Risos-Vidal anchored her petition on the theory that \u201c[Former President Estrada] is Disqualified to Run for Public Office because of his Conviction for Plunder by the Sandiganbayan in Criminal Case No. 26558 entitled \u2018People of the Philippines vs. Joseph Ejercito Estrada\u2019 Sentencing Him to Suffer the Penalty of Reclusion Perpetua with Perpetual Absolute Disqualification.\u201d[11] She relied on Section 40 of the Local Government Code (LGC), in relation to Section 12 of the Omnibus Election Code (OEC), which state respectively, that:Sec. 40, Local Government Code:SECTION 40. Disqualifications. - The following persons are disqualified from running for any elective local position:(a) Those sentenced by final judgment for an offense involving moral turpitude or for an offense punishable by one (1) year or more of imprisonment, within two (2) years after serving sentence;(b) Those removed from office as a result of an administrative case;(c) Those convicted by final judgment for violating the oath of allegiance to the Republic;(d) Those with dual citizenship;(e) Fugitives from justice in criminal or nonpolitical cases here or abroad;(f) Permanent residents in a foreign country or those who have acquired the right to reside abroad and continue to avail of the same right after the effectivity of this Code; and(g) The insane or feeble minded. (Emphasis supplied.)Sec. 12, Omnibus Election Code:Section 12. Disqualifications. - Any person who has been declared by competent authority insane or incompetent, or has been sentenced by final judgment for subversion, insurrection, rebellion, or for any offense for which he has been sentenced to a penalty of more than eighteen months or for a crime involving moral turpitude, shall be disqualified to be a candidate and to hold any public office, unless he has been given plenary pardon or granted amnesty. (Emphases supplied.)In a Resolution dated April 1, 2013, the COMELEC, Second Division, dismissed the petition for disqualification, the fallo of which reads:WHEREFORE, premises considered, the instant petition is hereby DISMISSED for utter lack of merit.[12]The COMELEC, Second Division, opined that \u201c[h]aving taken judicial cognizance of the consolidated resolution for SPA No. 09-028 (DC) and SPA No. 09-104 (DC) and the 10 May 2010 En Banc resolution affirming it, this Commission will not belabor the controversy further. Moreso, [Risos-Vidal] failed to present cogent proof sufficient to reverse the standing pronouncement of this Commission declaring categorically that [former President Estrada\u2019s] right to seek public office has been effectively restored by the pardon vested upon him by former President Gloria M. Arroyo. Since this Commission has already spoken, it will no longer engage in disquisitions of a settled matter lest indulged in wastage of government resources.\u201d[13]The subsequent motion for reconsideration filed by Risos-Vidal was denied in a Resolution dated April 23, 2013.On April 30, 2013, Risos-Vidal invoked the Court\u2019s jurisdiction by filing the present petition. She presented five issues for the Court\u2019s resolution, to wit:I. RESPONDENT COMELEC COMMITTED GRAVE ABUSE OF DISCRETION AMOUNTING TO LACK OR EXCESS OF JURISDICTION IN HOLDING THAT RESPONDENT ESTRADA\u2019S PARDON WAS NOT CONDITIONAL;II. RESPONDENT COMELEC COMMITTED GRAVE ABUSE OF DISCRETION AMOUNTING TO LACK OR EXCESS OF JURISDICTION IN NOT FINDING THAT RESPONDENT ESTRADA IS DISQUALIFIED TO RUN AS MAYOR OF MANILA UNDER SEC. 40 OF THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT CODE OF 1991 FOR HAVING BEEN CONVICTED OF PLUNDER, AN OFFENSE INVOLVING MORAL TURPITUDE;III. RESPONDENT COMELEC COMMITTED GRAVE ABUSE OF DISCRETION AMOUNTING TO LACK OR EXCESS OF JURISDICTION IN DISMISSING THE PETITION FOR DISQUALIFICATION ON THE GROUND THAT THE CASE INVOLVES THE SAME OR SIMILAR ISSUES IT ALREADY RESOLVED IN THE CASES OF \u201cPORMENTO VS. ESTRADA\u201d, SPA NO. 09-028 (DC) AND IN \u201cRE: PETITION TO DISQUALIFY ESTRADA EJERCITO, JOSEPH M. FROM RUNNING AS PRESIDENT, ETC.,\u201d SPA NO. 09-104 (DC);IV. RESPONDENT COMELEC COMMITTED GRAVE ABUSE OF DISCRETION AMOUNTING TO LACK OR EXCESS OF JURISDICTION IN NOT RULING THAT RESPONDENT ESTRADA\u2019S PARDON NEITHER RESTORED HIS RIGHT OF SUFFRAGE NOR REMITTED HIS PERPETUAL ABSOLUTE DISQUALIFICATION FROM SEEKING PUBLIC OFFICE; andV. RESPONDENT COMELEC COMMITTED GRAVE ABUSE OF DISCRETION AMOUNTING TO LACK OR EXCESS OF JURISDICTION IN NOT HAVING EXERCISED ITS POWER TO MOTU PROPRIO DISQUALIFY RESPONDENT ESTRADA IN THE FACE OF HIS PATENT DISQUALIFICATION TO RUN FOR PUBLIC OFFICE BECAUSE OF HIS PERPETUAL AND ABSOLUTE DISQUALIFICATION TO SEEK PUBLIC OFFICE AND TO VOTE RESULTING FROM HIS CRIMINAL CONVICTION FOR PLUNDER.[14]While this case was pending before the Court, or on May 13, 2013, the elections were conducted as scheduled and former President Estrada was voted into office with 349,770 votes cast in his favor. The next day, the local board of canvassers proclaimed him as the duly elected Mayor of the City of Manila.On June 7, 2013, Lim, one of former President Estrada\u2019s opponents for the position of Mayor, moved for leave to intervene in this case. His motion was granted by the Court in a Resolution[15] dated June 25, 2013. Lim subscribed to Risos-Vidal\u2019s theory that former President Estrada is disqualified to run for and hold public office as the pardon granted to the latter failed to expressly remit his perpetual disqualification. Further, given that former President Estrada is disqualified to run for and hold public office, all the votes obtained by the latter should be declared stray, and, being the second placer with 313,764 votes to his name, he (Lim) should be declared the rightful winning candidate for the position of Mayor of the City of Manila.The IssueThough raising five seemingly separate issues for resolution, the petition filed by Risos-Vidal actually presents only one essential question for resolution by the Court, that is, whether or not the COMELEC committed grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction in ruling that former President Estrada is qualified to vote and be voted for in public office as a result of the pardon granted to him by former President Arroyo.In her petition, Risos-Vidal starts her discussion by pointing out that the pardon granted to former President Estrada was conditional as evidenced by the latter\u2019s express acceptance thereof. The \u201cacceptance,\u201d she claims, is an indication of the conditional nature of the pardon, with the condition being embodied in the third Whereas Clause of the pardon, i.e., \u201cWHEREAS, Joseph Ejercito Estrada has publicly committed to no longer seek any elective position or office.\u201d She explains that the aforementioned commitment was what impelled former President Arroyo to pardon former President Estrada, without it, the clemency would not have been extended. And any breach thereof, that is, when former President Estrada filed his Certificate of Candidacy for President and Mayor of the City of Manila, he breached the condition of the pardon; hence, \u201che ought to be recommitted to prison to serve the unexpired portion of his sentence x x x and disqualifies him as a candidate for the mayoralty [position] of Manila.\u201d[16]Nonetheless, Risos-Vidal clarifies that the fundamental basis upon which former President Estrada must be disqualified from running for and holding public elective office is actually the proscription found in Section 40 of the LGC, in relation to Section 12 of the OEC. She argues that the crime of plunder is both an offense punishable by imprisonment of one year or more and involving moral turpitude; such that former President Estrada must be disqualified to run for and hold public elective office.Even with the pardon granted to former President Estrada, however, Risos-Vidal insists that the same did not operate to make available to former President Estrada the exception provided under Section 12 of the OEC, the pardon being merely conditional and not absolute or plenary.Moreover, Risos-Vidal puts a premium on the ostensible requirements provided under Articles 36 and 41 of the Revised Penal Code, to wit:ART. 36. Pardon; its effects. \u2013 A pardon shall not work the restoration of the right to hold public office, or the right of suffrage, unless such rights be expressly restored by the terms of the pardon.A pardon shall in no case exempt the culprit from the payment of the civil indemnity imposed upon him by the sentence.x x x xART. 41. Reclusion perpetua and reclusion temporal \u2013 Their accessory penalties. \u2013 The penalties of reclusion perpetua and reclusion temporal shall carry with them that of civil interdiction for life or during the period of the sentence as the case may be, and that of perpetual absolute disqualification which the offender shall suffer even though pardoned as to the principal penalty, unless the same shall have been expressly remitted in the pardon. (Emphases supplied.)She avers that in view of the foregoing provisions of law, it is not enough that a pardon makes a general statement that such pardon carries with it the restoration of civil and political rights. By virtue of Articles 36 and 41, a pardon restoring civil and political rights without categorically making mention what specific civil and political rights are restored \u201cshall not work to restore the right to hold public office, or the right of suffrage; nor shall it remit the accessory penalties of civil interdiction and perpetual absolute disqualification for the principal penalties of reclusion perpetua and reclusion temporal.\u201d[17] In other words, she considers the above constraints as mandatory requirements that shun a general or implied restoration of civil and political rights in pardons.Risos-Vidal cites the concurring opinions of Associate Justices Teodoro R. Padilla and Florentino P. Feliciano in Monsanto v. Factoran, Jr.[18] to endorse her position that \u201c[t]he restoration of the right to hold public office to one who has lost such right by reason of conviction in a criminal case, but subsequently pardoned, cannot be left to inference, no matter how intensely arguable, but must be stated in express, explicit, positive and specific language.\u201dApplying Monsanto to former President Estrada\u2019s case, Risos-Vidal reckons that \u201csuch express restoration is further demanded by the existence of the condition in the [third] [W]hereas [C]lause of the pardon x x x indubitably indicating that the privilege to hold public office was not restored to him.\u201d[19]On the other hand, the Office of the Solicitor General (OSG) for public respondent COMELEC, maintains that \u201cthe issue of whether or not the pardon extended to [former President Estrada] restored his right to run for public office had already been passed upon by public respondent COMELEC way back in 2010 via its rulings in SPA Nos. 09-024, 09-028 and 09-104, there is no cogent reason for it to reverse its standing pronouncement and declare [former President Estrada] disqualified to run and be voted as mayor of the City of Manila in the absence of any new argument that would warrant its reversal. To be sure, public respondent COMELEC correctly exercised its discretion in taking judicial cognizance of the aforesaid rulings which are known to it and which can be verified from its own records, in accordance with Section 2, Rule 129 of the Rules of Court on the courts\u2019 discretionary power to take judicial notice of matters which are of public knowledge, or are capable of unquestionable demonstration, or ought to be known to them because of their judicial functions.\u201d[20]Further, the OSG contends that \u201c[w]hile at first glance, it is apparent that [former President Estrada\u2019s] conviction for plunder disqualifies him from running as mayor of Manila under Section 40 of the [LGC], the subsequent grant of pardon to him, however, effectively restored his right to run for any public office.\u201d[21] The restoration of his right to run for any public office is the exception to the prohibition under Section 40 of the LGC, as provided under Section 12 of the OEC. As to the seeming requirement of Articles 36 and 41 of the Revised Penal Code, i.e., the express restoration/remission of a particular right to be stated in the pardon, the OSG asserts that \u201can airtight and rigid interpretation of Article 36 and Article 41 of the [RPC] x x x would be stretching too much the clear and plain meaning of the aforesaid provisions.\u201d[22] Lastly, taking into consideration the third Whereas Clause of the pardon granted to former President Estrada, the OSG supports the position that it \u201cis not an integral part of the decree of the pardon and cannot therefore serve to restrict its effectivity.\u201d[23]Thus, the OSG concludes that the \u201cCOMELEC did not commit grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction in issuing the assailed Resolutions.\u201d[24]For his part, former President Estrada presents the following significant arguments to defend his stay in office: that \u201cthe factual findings of public respondent COMELEC, the Constitutional body mandated to administer and enforce all laws relative to the conduct of the elections, [relative to the absoluteness of the pardon, the effects thereof, and the eligibility of former President Estrada to seek public elective office] are binding [and conclusive] on this Honorable Supreme Court;\u201d that he \u201cwas granted an absolute pardon and thereby restored to his full civil and political rights, including the right to seek public elective office such as the mayoral (sic) position in the City of Manila;\u201d that \u201cthe majority decision in the case of Salvacion A. Monsanto v. Fulgencio S. Factoran, Jr., which was erroneously cited by both Vidal and Lim as authority for their respective claims, x x x reveal that there was no discussion whatsoever in the ratio decidendi of the Monsanto case as to the alleged necessity for an expressed restoration of the \u2018right to hold public office in the pardon\u2019 as a legal pre-requisite to remove the subject perpetual special disqualification;\u201d that moreover, the \u201cprincipal question raised in this Monsanto case is whether or not a public officer, who has been granted an absolute pardon by the Chief Executive, is entitled to reinstatement to her former position without need of a new appointment;\u201d that his \u201cexpressed acceptance [of the pardon] is not proof that the pardon extended to [him] is conditional and not absolute;\u201d that this case is a mere rehash of the cases filed against him during his candidacy for President back in 2009-2010; that Articles 36 and 41 of the Revised Penal Code \u201ccannot abridge or diminish the pardoning power of the President expressly granted by the Constitution;\u201d that the text of the pardon granted to him substantially, if not fully, complied with the requirement posed by Article 36 of the Revised Penal Code as it was categorically stated in the said document that he was \u201crestored to his civil and political rights;\u201d that since pardon is an act of grace, it must be construed favorably in favor of the grantee;[25] and that his disqualification will result in massive disenfranchisement of the hundreds of thousands of Manile\u00f1os who voted for him.[26]The Court\u2019s RulingThe petition for certiorari lacks merit.Former President Estrada was granted an absolute pardon that fully restored all his civil and political rights, which naturally includes the right to seek public elective office, the focal point of this controversy. The wording of the pardon extended to former President Estrada is complete, unambiguous, and unqualified. It is likewise unfettered by Articles 36 and 41 of the Revised Penal Code. The only reasonable, objective, and constitutional interpretation of the language of the pardon is that the same in fact conforms to Articles 36 and 41 of the Revised Penal Code.Recall that the petition for disqualification filed by Risos-Vidal against former President Estrada, docketed as SPA No. 13-\u00ad\u00ad211 (DC), was anchored on Section 40 of the LGC, in relation to Section 12 of the OEC, that is, having been convicted of a crime punishable by imprisonment of one year or more, and involving moral turpitude, former President Estrada must be disqualified to run for and hold public elective office notwithstanding the fact that he is a grantee of a pardon that includes a statement expressing \u201c[h]e is hereby restored to his civil and political rights.\u201dRisos-Vidal theorizes that former President Estrada is disqualified from running for Mayor of Manila in the May 13, 2013 Elections, and remains disqualified to hold any local elective post despite the presidential pardon extended to him in 2007 by former President Arroyo for the reason that it (pardon) did not expressly provide for the remission of the penalty of perpetual absolute disqualification, particularly the restoration of his (former President Estrada) right to vote and be voted upon for public office. She invokes Articles 36 and 41 of the Revised Penal Code as the foundations of her theory.It is insisted that, since a textual examination of the pardon given to and accepted by former President Estrada does not actually specify which political right is restored, it could be inferred that former President Arroyo did not deliberately intend to restore former President Estrada\u2019s rights of suffrage and to hold public office, or to otherwise remit the penalty of perpetual absolute disqualification. Even if her intention was the contrary, the same cannot be upheld based on the pardon\u2019s text.The pardoning power of the President cannot be limited by legislative action. The 1987 Constitution, specifically Section 19 of Article VII and Section 5 of Article IX-C, provides that the President of the Philippines possesses the power to grant pardons, along with other acts of executive clemency, to wit:Section 19. Except in cases of impeachment, or as otherwise provided in this Constitution, the President may grant reprieves, commutations, and pardons, and remit fines and forfeitures, after conviction by final judgment.He shall also have the power to grant amnesty with the concurrence of a majority of all the Members of the Congress.x x x xSection 5. No pardon, amnesty, parole, or suspension of sentence for violation of election laws, rules, and regulations shall be granted by the President without the favorable recommendation of the Commission.It is apparent from the foregoing constitutional provisions that the only instances in which the President may not extend pardon remain to be in: (1) impeachment cases; (2) cases that have not yet resulted in a final conviction; and (3) cases involving violations of election laws, rules and regulations in which there was no favorable recommendation coming from the COMELEC. Therefore, it can be argued that any act of Congress by way of statute cannot operate to delimit the pardoning power of the President.In Cristobal v. Labrador[27] and Pelobello v. Palatino,[28] which were decided under the 1935 Constitution, wherein the provision granting pardoning power to the President shared similar phraseology with what is found in the present 1987 Constitution, the Court then unequivocally declared that \u201csubject to the limitations imposed by the Constitution, the pardoning power cannot be restricted or controlled by legislative action.\u201d The Court reiterated this pronouncement in Monsanto v. Factoran, Jr.[29] thereby establishing that, under the present Constitution, \u201ca pardon, being a presidential prerogative, should not be circumscribed by legislative action.\u201d Thus, it is unmistakably the long-standing position of this Court that the exercise of the pardoning power is discretionary in the President and may not be interfered with by Congress or the Court, except only when it exceeds the limits provided for by the Constitution.This doctrine of non-diminution or non-impairment of the President\u2019s power of pardon by acts of Congress, specifically through legislation, was strongly adhered to by an overwhelming majority of the framers of the 1987 Constitution when they flatly rejected a proposal to carve out an exception from the pardoning power of the President in the form of \u201coffenses involving graft and corruption\u201d that would be enumerated and defined by Congress through the enactment of a law. The following is the pertinent portion lifted from the Record of the Commission (Vol. II):MR. ROMULO. I ask that Commissioner Tan be recognized to introduce an amendment on the same section.THE PRESIDENT. Commissioner Tan is recognized.SR. TAN. Madam President, lines 7 to 9 state:However, the power to grant executive clemency for violations of corrupt practices laws may be limited by legislation.I suggest that this be deleted on the grounds that, first, violations of corrupt practices may include a very little offense like stealing P10; second, which I think is more important, I get the impression, rightly or wrongly, that subconsciously we are drafting a constitution on the premise that all our future Presidents will be bad and dishonest and, consequently, their acts will be lacking in wisdom. Therefore, this Article seems to contribute towards the creation of an anti-President Constitution or a President with vast responsibilities but no corresponding power except to declare martial law. Therefore, I request that these lines be deleted.MR. REGALADO. Madam President, may the Committee react to that?THE PRESIDENT. Yes, please.MR. REGALADO. This was inserted here on the resolution of Commissioner Davide because of the fact that similar to the provisions on the Commission on Elections, the recommendation of that Commission is required before executive clemency is granted because violations of the election laws go into the very political life of the country.With respect to violations of our Corrupt Practices Law, we felt that it is also necessary to have that subjected to the same condition because violation of our Corrupt Practices Law may be of such magnitude as to affect the very economic system of the country. Nevertheless, as a compromise, we provided here that it will be the Congress that will provide for the classification as to which convictions will still require prior recommendation; after all, the Congress could take into account whether or not the violation of the Corrupt Practices Law is of such magnitude as to affect the economic life of the country, if it is in the millions or billions of dollars. But I assume the Congress in its collective wisdom will exclude those petty crimes of corruption as not to require any further stricture on the exercise of executive clemency because, of course, there is a whale of a difference if we consider a lowly clerk committing malversation of government property or funds involving one hundred pesos. But then, we also anticipate the possibility that the corrupt practice of a public officer is of such magnitude as to have virtually drained a substantial portion of the treasury, and then he goes through all the judicial processes and later on, a President who may have close connections with him or out of improvident compassion may grant clemency under such conditions. That is why we left it to Congress to provide and make a classification based on substantial distinctions between a minor act of corruption or an act of substantial proportions.SR. TAN. So, why do we not just insert the word GROSS or GRAVE before the word \u201cviolations\u201d?MR. REGALADO. We feel that Congress can make a better distinction because \u201cGRAVE\u201d or \u201cGROSS\u201d can be misconstrued by putting it purely as a policy.MR. RODRIGO. Madam President.THE PRESIDENT. Commissioner Rodrigo is recognized.MR. RODRIGO. May I speak in favor of the proposed amendment?THE PRESIDENT. Please proceed.MR. RODRIGO. The power to grant executive clemency is essentially an executive power, and that is precisely why it is called executive clemency. In this sentence, which the amendment seeks to delete, an exception is being made. Congress, which is the legislative arm, is allowed to intrude into this prerogative of the executive. Then it limits the power of Congress to subtract from this prerogative of the President to grant executive clemency by limiting the power of Congress to only corrupt practices laws. There are many other crimes more serious than these. Under this amendment, Congress cannot limit the power of executive clemency in cases of drug addiction and drug pushing which are very, very serious crimes that can endanger the State; also, rape with murder, kidnapping and treason. Aside from the fact that it is a derogation of the power of the President to grant executive clemency, it is also defective in that it singles out just one kind of crime. There are far more serious crimes which are not included.MR. REGALADO. I will just make one observation on that. We admit that the pardoning power is an executive power. But even in the provisions on the COMELEC, one will notice that constitutionally, it is required that there be a favorable recommendation by the Commission on Elections for any violation of election laws.At any rate, Commissioner Davide, as the principal proponent of that and as a member of the Committee, has explained in the committee meetings we had why he sought the inclusion of this particular provision. May we call on Commissioner Davide to state his position.MR. DAVIDE. Madam President.THE PRESIDENT. Commissioner Davide is recognized.MR. DAVIDE. I am constrained to rise to object to the proposal. We have just approved the Article on Accountability of Public Officers. Under it, it is mandated that a public office is a public trust, and all government officers are under obligation to observe the utmost of responsibility, integrity, loyalty and efficiency, to lead modest lives and to act with patriotism and justice.In all cases, therefore, which would go into the very core of the concept that a public office is a public trust, the violation is itself a violation not only of the economy but the moral fabric of public officials. And that is the reason we now want that if there is any conviction for the violation of the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act, which, in effect, is a violation of the public trust character of the public office, no pardon shall be extended to the offender, unless some limitations are imposed.Originally, my limitation was, it should be with the concurrence of the convicting court, but the Committee left it entirely to the legislature to formulate the mechanics at trying, probably, to distinguish between grave and less grave or serious cases of violation of the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act. Perhaps this is now the best time, since we have strengthened the Article on Accountability of Public Officers, to accompany it with a mandate that the President\u2019s right to grant executive clemency for offenders or violators of laws relating to the concept of a public office may be limited by Congress itself.MR. SARMIENTO. Madam President.THE PRESIDENT. Commissioner Sarmiento is recognized.MR. SARMIENTO. May I briefly speak in favor of the amendment by deletion.Madam President, over and over again, we have been saying and arguing before this Constitutional Commission that we are emasculating the powers of the presidency, and this provision to me is another clear example of that. So, I speak against this provision. Even the 1935 and the 1973 Constitutions do not provide for this kind of provision.I am supporting the amendment by deletion of Commissioner Tan.MR. ROMULO. Commissioner Tingson would like to be recognized.THE PRESIDENT. Commissioner Tingson is recognized.MR. TINGSON. Madam President, I am also in favor of the amendment by deletion because I am in sympathy with the stand of Commissioner Francisco \u201cSoc\u201d Rodrigo. I do believe and we should remember that above all the elected or appointed officers of our Republic, the leader is the President. I believe that the country will be as the President is, and if we systematically emasculate the power of this presidency, the time may come when he will be also handcuffed that he will no longer be able to act like he should be acting.So, Madam President, I am in favor of the deletion of this particular line.MR. ROMULO. Commissioner Colayco would like to be recognized.THE PRESIDENT. Commissioner Colayco is recognized.MR. COLAYCO. Thank you very much, Madam President.I seldom rise here to object to or to commend or to recommend the approval of proposals, but now I find that the proposal of Commissioner Tan is worthy of approval of this body.Why are we singling out this particular offense? There are other crimes which cast a bigger blot on the moral character of the public officials.Finally, this body should not be the first one to limit the almost absolute power of our Chief Executive in deciding whether to pardon, to reprieve or to commute the sentence rendered by the court.I thank you.THE PRESIDENT. Are we ready to vote now?MR. ROMULO. Commissioner Padilla would like to be recognized, and after him will be Commissioner Natividad.THE PRESIDENT. Commissioner Padilla is recognized.MR. PADILLA. Only one sentence, Madam President. The Sandiganbayan has been called the Anti-Graft Court, so if this is allowed to stay, it would mean that the President\u2019s power to grant pardon or reprieve will be limited to the cases decided by the Anti-Graft Court, when as already stated, there are many provisions in the Revised Penal Code that penalize more serious offenses.Moreover, when there is a judgment of conviction and the case merits the consideration of the exercise of executive clemency, usually under Article V of the Revised Penal Code the judge will recommend such exercise of clemency. And so, I am in favor of the amendment proposed by Commissioner Tan for the deletion of this last sentence in Section 17.THE PRESIDENT. Are we ready to vote now, Mr. Floor Leader?MR. NATIVIDAD. Just one more.THE PRESIDENT. Commissioner Natividad is recognized.MR. NATIVIDAD. I am also against this provision which will again chip more powers from the President. In case of other criminals convicted in our society, we extend probation to them while in this case, they have already been convicted and we offer mercy. The only way we can offer mercy to them is through this executive clemency extended to them by the President. If we still close this avenue to them, they would be prejudiced even worse than the murderers and the more vicious killers in our society. I do not think they deserve this opprobrium and punishment under the new Constitution.I am in favor of the proposed amendment of Commissioner Tan.MR. ROMULO. We are ready to vote, Madam President.THE PRESIDENT. Is this accepted by the Committee?MR. REGALADO. The Committee, Madam President, prefers to submit this to the floor and also because of the objection of the main proponent, Commissioner Davide. So we feel that the Commissioners should vote on this question.VOTINGTHE PRESIDENT. As many as are in favor of the proposed amendment of Commissioner Tan to delete the last sentence of Section 17 appearing on lines 7, 8 and 9, please raise their hand. (Several Members raised their hand.)As many as are against, please raise their hand. (Few Members raised their hand.)The results show 34 votes in favor and 4 votes against; the amendment is approved.[30] (Emphases supplied.)The proper interpretation of Articles 36 and 41 of the Revised Penal Code.The foregoing pronouncements solidify the thesis that Articles 36 and 41 of the Revised Penal Code cannot, in any way, serve to abridge or diminish the exclusive power and prerogative of the President to pardon persons convicted of violating penal statutes.The Court cannot subscribe to Risos-Vidal\u2019s interpretation that the said Articles contain specific textual commands which must be strictly followed in order to free the beneficiary of presidential grace from the disqualifications specifically prescribed by them.Again, Articles 36 and 41 of the Revised Penal Code provides:ART. 36. Pardon; its effects. \u2013 A pardon shall not work the restoration of the right to hold public office, or the right of suffrage, unless such rights be expressly restored by the terms of the pardon.A pardon shall in no case exempt the culprit from the payment of the civil indemnity imposed upon him by the sentence.x x x xART. 41. Reclusion perpetua and reclusion temporal \u2013 Their accessory penalties. \u2013 The penalties of reclusion perpetua and reclusion temporal shall carry with them that of civil interdiction for life or during the period of the sentence as the case may be, and that of perpetual absolute disqualification which the offender shall suffer even though pardoned as to the principal penalty, unless the same shall have been expressly remitted in the pardon. (Emphases supplied.)A rigid and inflexible reading of the above provisions of law, as proposed by Risos-Vidal, is unwarranted, especially so if it will defeat or unduly restrict the power of the President to grant executive clemency.It is well-entrenched in this jurisdiction that where the words of a statute are clear, plain, and free from ambiguity, it must be given its literal meaning and applied without attempted interpretation. Verba legis non est recedendum. From the words of a statute there should be no departure.[31] It is this Court\u2019s firm view that the phrase in the presidential pardon at issue which declares that former President Estrada \u201cis hereby restored to his civil and political rights\u201d substantially complies with the requirement of express restoration.The Dissent of Justice Marvic M.V.F. Leonen agreed with Risos-Vidal that there was no express remission and/or restoration of the rights of suffrage and/or to hold public office in the pardon granted to former President Estrada, as required by Articles 36 and 41 of the Revised Penal Code.Justice Leonen posits in his Dissent that the aforementioned codal provisions must be followed by the President, as they do not abridge or diminish the President\u2019s power to extend clemency. He opines that they do not reduce the coverage of the President\u2019s pardoning power. Particularly, he states:Articles 36 and 41 refer only to requirements of convention or form. They only provide a procedural prescription. They are not concerned with areas where or the instances when the President may grant pardon; they are only concerned with how he or she is to exercise such power so that no other governmental instrumentality needs to intervene to give it full effect.All that Articles 36 and 41 do is prescribe that, if the President wishes to include in the pardon the restoration of the rights of suffrage and to hold public office, or the remission of the accessory penalty of perpetual absolute disqualification, he or she should do so expressly. Articles 36 and 41 only ask that the President state his or her intentions clearly, directly, firmly, precisely, and unmistakably. To belabor the point, the President retains the power to make such restoration or remission, subject to a prescription on the manner by which he or she is to state it.[32]With due respect, I disagree with the overbroad statement that Congress may dictate as to how the President may exercise his/her power of executive clemency. The form or manner by which the President, or Congress for that matter, should exercise their respective Constitutional powers or prerogatives cannot be interfered with unless it is so provided in the Constitution. This is the essence of the principle of separation of powers deeply ingrained in our system of government which \u201cordains that each of the three great branches of government has exclusive cognizance of and is supreme in matters falling within its own constitutionally allocated sphere.\u201d[33] Moreso, this fundamental principle must be observed if non-compliance with the form imposed by one branch on a co-equal and coordinate branch will result into the diminution of an exclusive Constitutional prerogative.For this reason, Articles 36 and 41 of the Revised Penal Code should be construed in a way that will give full effect to the executive clemency granted by the President, instead of indulging in an overly strict interpretation that may serve to impair or diminish the import of the pardon which emanated from the Office of the President and duly signed by the Chief Executive himself/herself. The said codal provisions must be construed to harmonize the power of Congress to define crimes and prescribe the penalties for such crimes and the power of the President to grant executive clemency. All that the said provisions impart is that the pardon of the principal penalty does not carry with it the remission of the accessory penalties unless the President expressly includes said accessory penalties in the pardon. It still recognizes the Presidential prerogative to grant executive clemency and, specifically, to decide to pardon the principal penalty while excluding its accessory penalties or to pardon both. Thus, Articles 36 and 41 only clarify the effect of the pardon so decided upon by the President on the penalties imposed in accordance with law.A close scrutiny of the text of the pardon extended to former President Estrada shows that both the principal penalty of reclusion perpetua and its accessory penalties are included in the pardon. The first sentence refers to the executive clemency extended to former President Estrada who was convicted by the Sandiganbayan of plunder and imposed a penalty of reclusion perpetua. The latter is the principal penalty pardoned which relieved him of imprisonment. The sentence that followed, which states that \u201c(h)e is hereby restored to his civil and political rights,\u201d expressly remitted the accessory penalties that attached to the principal penalty of reclusion perpetua. Hence, even if we apply Articles 36 and 41 of the Revised Penal Code, it is indubitable from the text of the pardon that the accessory penalties of civil interdiction and perpetual absolute disqualification were expressly remitted together with the principal penalty of reclusion perpetua.In this jurisdiction, the right to seek public elective office is recognized by law as falling under the whole gamut of civil and political rights.Section 5 of Republic Act No. 9225,[34] otherwise known as the \u201cCitizenship Retention and Reacquisition Act of 2003,\u201d reads as follows:Section 5. Civil and Political Rights and Liabilities. \u2013 Those who retain or reacquire Philippine citizenship under this Act shall enjoy full civil and political rights and be subject to all attendant liabilities and responsibilities under existing laws of the Philippines and the following conditions:(1) Those intending to exercise their right of suffrage must meet the requirements under Section 1, Article V of the Constitution, Republic Act No. 9189, otherwise known as \u201cThe Overseas Absentee Voting Act of 2003\u201d and other existing laws;(2) Those seeking elective public office in the Philippines shall meet the qualifications for holding such public office as required by the Constitution and existing laws and, at the time of the filing of the certificate of candidacy, make a personal and sworn renunciation of any and all foreign citizenship before any public officer authorized to administer an oath;(3) Those appointed to any public office shall subscribe and swear an oath of allegiance to the Republic of the Philippines and its duly constituted authorities prior to their assumption of office: Provided, That they renounce their oath of allegiance to the country where they took that oath;(4) Those intending to practice their profession in the Philippines shall apply with the proper authority for a license or permit to engage in such practice; and(5) That right to vote or be elected or appointed to any public office in the Philippines cannot be exercised by, or extended to, those who:(a) are candidates for or are occupying any public office in the country of which they are naturalized citizens; and/or(b) are in active service as commissioned or noncommissioned officers in the armed forces of the country which they are naturalized citizens. (Emphases supplied.)No less than the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, to which the Philippines is a signatory, acknowledges the existence of said right. Article 25(b) of the Convention states:Article 25Every citizen shall have the right and the opportunity, without any of the distinctions mentioned in Article 2 and without unreasonable restrictions:x x x x(b) To vote and to be elected at genuine periodic elections which shall be by universal and equal suffrage and shall be held by secret ballot, guaranteeing the free expression of the will of the electors[.] (Emphasis supplied.)Recently, in Sobejana-Condon v. Commission on Elections,[35] the Court unequivocally referred to the right to seek public elective office as a political right, to wit:Stated differently, it is an additional qualification for elective office specific only to Filipino citizens who re-acquire their citizenship under Section 3 of R.A. No. 9225. It is the operative act that restores their right to run for public office. The petitioner\u2019s failure to comply therewith in accordance with the exact tenor of the law, rendered ineffectual the Declaration of Renunciation of Australian Citizenship she executed on September 18, 2006. As such, she is yet to regain her political right to seek elective office. Unless she executes a sworn renunciation of her Australian citizenship, she is ineligible to run for and hold any elective office in the Philippines. (Emphasis supplied.)Thus, from both law and jurisprudence, the right to seek public elective office is unequivocally considered as a political right. Hence, the Court reiterates its earlier statement that the pardon granted to former President Estrada admits no other interpretation other than to mean that, upon acceptance of the pardon granted to him, he regained his FULL civil and political rights \u2013 including the right to seek elective office.On the other hand, the theory of Risos-Vidal goes beyond the plain meaning of said penal provisions; and prescribes a formal requirement that is not only unnecessary but, if insisted upon, could be in derogation of the constitutional prohibition relative to the principle that the exercise of presidential pardon cannot be affected by legislative action.Risos-Vidal relied heavily on the separate concurring opinions in Monsanto v. Factoran, Jr.[36] to justify her argument that an absolute pardon must expressly state that the right to hold public office has been restored, and that the penalty of perpetual absolute disqualification has been remitted.This is incorrect.Her reliance on said opinions is utterly misplaced. Although the learned views of Justices Teodoro R. Padilla and Florentino P. Feliciano are to be respected, they do not form part of the controlling doctrine nor to be considered part of the law of the land. On the contrary, a careful reading of the majority opinion in Monsanto, penned by no less than Chief Justice Marcelo B. Fernan, reveals no statement that denotes adherence to a stringent and overly nuanced application of Articles 36 and 41 of the Revised Penal Code that will in effect require the President to use a statutorily prescribed language in extending executive clemency, even if the intent of the President can otherwise be deduced from the text or words used in the pardon. Furthermore, as explained above, the pardon here is consistent with, and not contrary to, the provisions of Articles 36 and 41.The disqualification of former President Estrada under Section 40 of the LGC in relation to Section 12 of the OEC was removed by his acceptance of the absolute pardon granted to him.Section 40 of the LGC identifies who are disqualified from running for any elective local position. Risos-Vidal argues that former President Estrada is disqualified under item (a), to wit:(a) Those sentenced by final judgment for an offense involving moral turpitude or for an offense punishable by one (1) year or more of imprisonment, within two (2) years after serving sentence[.] (Emphasis supplied.)Likewise, Section 12 of the OEC provides for similar prohibitions, but it provides for an exception, to wit:Section 12. Disqualifications. \u2013 x x x unless he has been given plenary pardon or granted amnesty. (Emphasis supplied.)As earlier stated, Risos-Vidal maintains that former President Estrada\u2019s conviction for plunder disqualifies him from running for the elective local position of Mayor of the City of Manila under Section 40(a) of the LGC. However, the subsequent absolute pardon granted to former President Estrada effectively restored his right to seek public elective office. This is made possible by reading Section 40(a) of the LGC in relation to Section 12 of the OEC.While it may be apparent that the proscription in Section 40(a) of the LGC is worded in absolute terms, Section 12 of the OEC provides a legal escape from the prohibition \u2013 a plenary pardon or amnesty. In other words, the latter provision allows any person who has been granted plenary pardon or amnesty after conviction by final judgment of an offense involving moral turpitude, inter alia, to run for and hold any public office, whether local or national position.Take notice that the applicability of Section 12 of the OEC to candidates running for local elective positions is not unprecedented. In Jalosjos, Jr. v. Commission on Elections,[37] the Court acknowledged the aforementioned provision as one of the legal remedies that may be availed of to disqualify a candidate in a local election filed any day after the last day for filing of certificates of candidacy, but not later than the date of proclamation.[38] The pertinent ruling in the Jalosjos case is quoted as follows:What is indisputably clear is that false material representation of Jalosjos is a ground for a petition under Section 78. However, since the false material representation arises from a crime penalized by prision mayor, a petition under Section 12 of the Omnibus Election Code or Section 40 of the Local Government Code can also be properly filed. The petitioner has a choice whether to anchor his petition on Section 12 or Section 78 of the Omnibus Election Code, or on Section 40 of the Local Government Code. The law expressly provides multiple remedies and the choice of which remedy to adopt belongs to petitioner.[39] (Emphasis supplied.)The third preambular clause of the pardon did not operate to make the pardon conditional. Contrary to Risos-Vidal\u2019s declaration, the third preambular clause of the pardon, i.e., \u201c[w]hereas, Joseph Ejercito Estrada has publicly committed to no longer seek any elective position or office,\u201d neither makes the pardon conditional, nor militate against the conclusion that former President Estrada\u2019s rights to suffrage and to seek public elective office have been restored. This is especially true as the pardon itself does not explicitly impose a condition or limitation, considering the unqualified use of the term \u201ccivil and political rights\u201d as being restored.Jurisprudence educates that a preamble is not an essential part of an act as it is an introductory or preparatory clause that explains the reasons for the enactment, usually introduced by the word \u201cwhereas.\u201d[40] Whereas clauses do not form part of a statute because, strictly speaking, they are not part of the operative language of the statute.[41] In this case, the whereas clause at issue is not an integral part of the decree of the pardon, and therefore, does not by itself alone operate to make the pardon conditional or to make its effectivity contingent upon the fulfilment of the aforementioned commitment nor to limit the scope of the pardon.On this matter, the Court quotes with approval a relevant excerpt of COMELEC Commissioner Maria Gracia Padaca\u2019s separate concurring opinion in the assailed April 1, 2013 Resolution of the COMELEC in SPA No. 13-211 (DC), which captured the essence of the legal effect of preambular paragraphs/whereas clauses, viz:The present dispute does not raise anything which the 20 January 2010 Resolution did not conclude upon. Here, Petitioner Risos-Vidal raised the same argument with respect to the 3rd \u201cwhereas clause\u201d or preambular paragraph of the decree of pardon. It states that \u201cJoseph Ejercito Estrada has publicly committed to no longer seek any elective position or office.\u201d On this contention, the undersigned reiterates the ruling of the Commission that the 3rd preambular paragraph does not have any legal or binding effect on the absolute nature of the pardon extended by former President Arroyo to herein Respondent.This ruling is consistent with the traditional and customary usage of preambular paragraphs. In the case of Echegaray v. Secretary of Justice, the Supreme Court ruled on the legal effect of preambular paragraphs or whereas clauses on statutes. The Court stated, viz.:Besides, a preamble is really not an integral part of a law. It is merely an introduction to show its intent or purposes. It cannot be the origin of rights and obligations. Where the meaning of a statute is clear and unambiguous, the preamble can neither expand nor restrict its operation much less prevail over its text.If former President Arroyo intended for the pardon to be conditional on Respondent\u2019s promise never to seek a public office again, the former ought to have explicitly stated the same in the text of the pardon itself. Since former President Arroyo did not make this an integral part of the decree of pardon, the Commission is constrained to rule that the 3rd preambular clause cannot be interpreted as a condition to the pardon extended to former President Estrada.[42] (Emphasis supplied.)Absent any contrary evidence, former President Arroyo\u2019s silence on former President Estrada\u2019s decision to run for President in the May 2010 elections against, among others, the candidate of the political party of former President Arroyo, after the latter\u2019s receipt and acceptance of the pardon speaks volume of her intention to restore him to his rights to suffrage and to hold public office.Where the scope and import of the executive clemency extended by the President is in issue, the Court must turn to the only evidence available to it, and that is the pardon itself. From a detailed review of the four corners of said document, nothing therein gives an iota of intimation that the third Whereas Clause is actually a limitation, proviso, stipulation or condition on the grant of the pardon, such that the breach of the mentioned commitment not to seek public office will result in a revocation or cancellation of said pardon. To the Court, what it is simply is a statement of fact or the prevailing situation at the time the executive clemency was granted. It was not used as a condition to the efficacy or to delimit the scope of the pardon.Even if the Court were to subscribe to the view that the third Whereas Clause was one of the reasons to grant the pardon, the pardon itself does not provide for the attendant consequence of the breach thereof. This Court will be hard put to discern the resultant effect of an eventual infringement. Just like it will be hard put to determine which civil or political rights were restored if the Court were to take the road suggested by Risos-Vidal that the statement \u201c[h]e is hereby restored to his civil and political rights\u201d excludes the restoration of former President Estrada\u2019s rights to suffrage and to hold public office. The aforequoted text of the executive clemency granted does not provide the Court with any guide as to how and where to draw the line between the included and excluded political rights.Justice Leonen emphasizes the point that the ultimate issue for resolution is not whether the pardon is contingent on the condition that former President Estrada will not seek another elective public office, but it actually concerns the coverage of the pardon \u2013 whether the pardon granted to former President Estrada was so expansive as to have restored all his political rights, inclusive of the rights of suffrage and to hold public office. Justice Leonen is of the view that the pardon in question is not absolute nor plenary in scope despite the statement that former President Estrada is \u201chereby restored to his civil and political rights,\u201d that is, the foregoing statement restored to former President Estrada all his civil and political rights except the rights denied to him by the unremitted penalty of perpetual absolute disqualification made up of, among others, the rights of suffrage and to hold public office. He adds that had the President chosen to be so expansive as to include the rights of suffrage and to hold public office, she should have been more clear on her intentions.However, the statement \u201c[h]e is hereby restored to his civil and political rights,\u201d to the mind of the Court, is crystal clear \u2013 the pardon granted to former President Estrada was absolute, meaning, it was not only unconditional, it was unrestricted in scope, complete and plenary in character, as the term \u201cpolitical rights\u201d adverted to has a settled meaning in law and jurisprudence.With due respect, I disagree too with Justice Leonen that the omission of the qualifying word \u201cfull\u201d can be construed as excluding the restoration of the rights of suffrage and to hold public office. There appears to be no distinction as to the coverage of the term \u201cfull political rights\u201d and the term \u201cpolitical rights\u201d used alone without any qualification. How to ascribe to the latter term the meaning that it is \u201cpartial\u201d and not \u201cfull\u201d defies one\u2019s understanding. More so, it will be extremely difficult to identify which of the political rights are restored by the pardon, when the text of the latter is silent on this matter. Exceptions to the grant of pardon cannot be presumed from the absence of the qualifying word \u201cfull\u201d when the pardon restored the \u201cpolitical rights\u201d of former President Estrada without any exclusion or reservation.Therefore, there can be no other conclusion but to say that the pardon granted to former President Estrada was absolute in the absence of a clear, unequivocal and concrete factual basis upon which to anchor or support the Presidential intent to grant a limited pardon.To reiterate, insofar as its coverage is concerned, the text of the pardon can withstand close scrutiny even under the provisions of Articles 36 and 41 of the Revised Penal Code.The COMELEC did not commit grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction in issuing the assailed Resolutions. In light of the foregoing, contrary to the assertions of Risos-Vidal, the COMELEC did not commit grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction in issuing the assailed Resolutions.The Court has consistently held that a petition for certiorari against actions of the COMELEC is confined only to instances of grave abuse of discretion amounting to patent and substantial denial of due process, because the COMELEC is presumed to be most competent in matters falling within its domain.[43]As settled in jurisprudence, grave abuse of discretion is the arbitrary exercise of power due to passion, prejudice or personal hostility; or the whimsical, arbitrary, or capricious exercise of power that amounts to an evasion or refusal to perform a positive duty enjoined by law or to act at all in contemplation of law. For an act to be condemned as having been done with grave abuse of discretion, such an abuse must be patent and gross.[44]The arguments forwarded by Risos-Vidal fail to adequately demonstrate any factual or legal bases to prove that the assailed COMELEC Resolutions were issued in a \u201cwhimsical, arbitrary or capricious exercise of power that amounts to an evasion or refusal to perform a positive duty enjoined by law\u201d or were so \u201cpatent and gross\u201d as to constitute grave abuse of discretion.On the foregoing premises and conclusions, this Court finds it unnecessary to separately discuss Lim\u2019s petition-in-intervention, which substantially presented the same arguments as Risos-Vidal\u2019s petition.WHEREFORE, the petition for certiorari and petition-in-intervention are DISMISSED. The Resolution dated April 1, 2013 of the Commission on Elections, Second Division, and the Resolution dated April 23, 2013 of the Commission on Elections, En banc, both in SPA No. 13-211 (DC), are AFFIRMED.SO ORDERED.Sereno, (Chief Justice), I join the dissent of J.

No. 207900, April 22, 2014.SEPARATE OPINIONBRION, J.:I concur with the ponencia\u2019s conclusion that the pardon granted to respondent Joseph Ejercito Estrada (or Erap for brevity) by President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo (or PGMA for brevity) restored his rights to run for and hold public office and to vote.I likewise agree with the ponencia that Erap\u2019s pardon complied with the requirements under Articles 36 and 41 of the Revised Penal Code (RPC). Specifically, Erap\u2019s pardon contained an express restoration of his rights to vote and to hold public office and an express remission of Erap\u2019s perpetual absolute disqualification brought about by his conviction for plunder. As I will discuss below, these rights are subsumed under the phrase \u201ccivil and political rights\u201d that PGMA expressly restored in Erap\u2019s pardon.I add that aside from the points discussed by the ponencia, other material legal justifications exist that would support the same conclusion and address the vagueness that Risos-Vidal attributes to the textual language of Erap\u2019s pardon. These legal justifications include an unbiased examination of the third preambular clause of Erap\u2019s pardon, the official definition of \u201cabsolute pardon,\u201d and the pertinent rules on statutory construction that, in instances of doubt, give primacy to the interests of the voters in election cases such as the present case. I shall discuss all these below.I maintain, too, that despite the ponencia\u2019s resolution of the issue of Erap\u2019s pardon and its effects on his perpetual absolute disqualification, an equally important issue lingers and remains unresolved - whether or not the Commission on Elections (COMELEC) gravely abused its discretion in relying on its 2010 rulings that Erap\u2019s pardon restored his rights to vote and to be voted for a public office.This issue is particularly important since the Court\u2019s certiorari jurisdiction is being invoked and the assailed COMELEC rulings are not being questioned specifically on its ruling on the issue of Erap\u2019s pardon but on the COMELEC\u2019s reliance on its 2010 ruling on this particular issue.This 2010 disqualification ruling pertained to the consolidated COMELEC Resolution in SPA No. 09-028 (DC) and SPA No. 09-104 (DC), entitled Atty. Evilio C. Pormento v. Joseph Ejercito Estrada and In Re: Petition to Disqualify Estrada Ejercito, Joseph M. From Running As President Due to Constitutional Disqualification and Creating Confusion to the Prejudice of Estrada, Mary Lou B. These cases were filed against Erap when he ran as President of the Philippines in the 2010 elections.For clarity, the COMELEC Second Division\u2019s resolution dated April 1, 2013 that is being questioned in the present case states: \u201cToday, this Commission is confronted with a controversy that is far from novelty. Albeit raised by another petitioner, the issue raised in the present case is glaringly similar to or intertwined with the issues involved in the consolidated resolution for SPA No. 09-028 (DC) and SPA No. 09-104 (DC). Therefore, it cannot be gainsaid that the question of whether or not the pardon granted to respondent has restored his right to run for public office, which was curtailed by virtue of his conviction for plunder that carries with it the penalty of perpetual absolute disqualification, has been passed upon and ruled out by this Commission way back in 2010... Having taken judicial cognizance of the consolidated resolution for SPA No. 09-028 (DC) and SPA No. 09-104 (DC) and the 10 May 2010 En Banc resolution affirming it, this Commission will not belabor the controversy further. More so, petitioner failed to present cogent proof sufficient to reverse the standing pronouncement of this Commission declaring categorically that respondent\u2019s right to seek public office has been effectively restored by the pardon vested upon him by former President Gloria M. Arroyo. Since this Commission has already spoken, it will no longer engage in disquisitions of a settled matter lest indulged in wastage of government resources.\u201dThis COMELEC Second Division ruling was upheld by the COMELEC en banc in its Resolution dated April 23, 2013, which is also being assailed in the present case.I stress that the above 2013 COMELEC rulings that are sought to be nullified in the present case did not explicitly rule on the issue of Erap\u2019s pardon but merely relied on the 2010 COMELEC rulings on this particular issue. According to Risos-Vidal, this \u201creliance\u201d constituted grave abuse of discretion.To my mind, in the exercise of the Court\u2019s certiorari jurisdiction, the issue of whether or not the COMELEC gravely abused its discretion in relying on its 2010 rulings on Erap\u2019s pardon should be squarely ruled upon on the merits, especially because Risos-Vidal and the parties raised this particular issue in the present case.Another crucial issue that must be resolved, in view of its jurisprudential repercussions, is the legal propriety of Alfredo S. Lim\u2019s (Lim) intervention in the present case.I discuss all these issues below.I.Prefatory StatementBefore this Court is an election disqualification case involving a candidate (and subsequent winner) in the 2013 elections. By their nature, disqualification cases are not unusual; in our political system they are given free rein because they affect voters\u2019 choice and governance.What distinguishes this case is the basis for the objection - the executive clemency (or as interchangeably used in this Opinion, the pardon) previously granted by the former President of the Republic Gloria Macapagal Arroyo to her immediate predecessor, respondent President Joseph Ejercito Estrada, whom the former replaced under extraordinary circumstances.At issue is not the validity of the pardon as this issue has not been raised; at issue (to be decided in the context of the presence or absence of grave abuse of discretion by the COMELEC) are the intepretation of the terms of the pardon and the grantor\u2019s intent, a matter that \u2013 in the absence of direct evidence from grantor PGMA \u2013 the Court has to discern from the pardon\u2019s written terms. Intertwined with this issue is the question of whether or not the COMELEC gravely abused its discretion in dismissing the Risos-Vidal petition based on its 2010 ruling that Erap\u2019s pardon restored his rights to vote and to be voted for a public office.Thus, we are largely left with the task of interpreting the terms of the pardon that a politician granted to another politician, for the application of its terms to a dispute in a political setting \u2013 the elections of 2013. This characterization of the present case, however, should not change nor affect the Court\u2019s mode of resolution: the Constitution only allows us to adjudicate on the basis of the law, jurisprudence and established legal principles.Under this approach, the Court should also be aware that beyond the direct parties, another party \u2013 the formally unnamed and unimpleaded electorate \u2013 has interests that the Court should take into account. The electorate has a continuing stake in this case because they participated and expressed their choice in the 2013 elections; in fact, not one of the entities that could have prevented them from voting \u2013 the COMELEC and this Court \u2013 acted to prevent Erap from being voted upon.Their participation, to my mind, brings into the picture the need to consider and apply deeper democratic principles: while the voters are generally the governed, they are at the same time the sovereign who decides how and by whom they are to be governed. This step is particularly relevant in the present case since the electorate\u2019s unquestioned preference was Erap, the recipient of the disputed pardon.I recite all these as they are the underlying considerations I shall take into account in this Separate Opinion.Aside from points of law, I also take into account the interests of the voters. These interests, in my view, should not only be considered but given weight and even primacy, particularly in a situation of doubt.II.The Roots of the Present CaseA. The Early Roots: The Plunder and the Pardon.The present case traces its roots to respondent Erap\u2019s term as President of the Philippines which started at noon of June 30, 1998. He relinquished his post in the middle of his term and was thereafter charged with the crime of Plunder.[1] The Sandiganbayan convicted him on September 12, 2007 and imposed on him the penalty of reclusion perpetua and its accessory penalties.On October 25, 2007, former President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo (PGMA) granted Erap executive clemency under terms that in part provides:IN VIEW HEREOF and pursuant to the authority conferred upon me by the Constitution, I hereby grant executive clemency to JOSEPH EJERCITO ESTRADA, convicted by the Sandiganbayan of Plunder and imposed a penalty of Reclusion Perpetua. He is hereby restored to his civil and political rights. [Emphasis supplied]Erap accepted the pardon without qualifications on October 26, 2007.B. Erap\u2019s 2010 Presidential Candidacy & Disqualification Cases.On November 30, 2009, Erap filed his Certificate of Candidacy (CoC) for the position of President of the Philippines.His candidacy immediately drew a trilogy of cases that were filed on or about the same time, with the intent of disqualifying him from running as President and from holding office if he would win.The first was a petition to cancel and deny due course to Estrada\u2019s CoC [SPA 09-024 (DC)][2] filed by Elly Velez B. Lao Pamatong (Pamatong). PGMA was also impleaded as a respondent. Pamatong alleged that Erap could not validly run for the presidency because of the constitutional ban against re-election; he also claimed that PGMA was also prohibited from running for any elective public office, even as a representative of the 2nd district of Pampanga. Pamatong also argued in his position paper that Erap\u2019s pardon was not absolute as it was conditioned on his promise not to run for any public office.[3]The second formal objection to Erap\u2019s presidential candidacy came from Evilio C. Pormento (Pormento) who filed his \u201cUrgent Petition for Disqualification as Presidential Candidate\u201d on December 5, 2009 (docketed as SPA 09-028). Pormento alleged that Erap was not eligible for re-election for the position of President pursuant to Article VII, Section 4 of the Constitution. In his answer to Pormento, Erap re-pleaded his defenses in the Pamatong case and added that the grant of executive clemency in his favor removed all legal impediments that might bar his candidacy for the presidency.[4]The third objection was filed by Mary Lou Estrada, a presidential candidate, who filed a petition for disqualification and cancellation of Erap\u2019s CoC based on the grounds that he was not eligible for re-election and that Erap\u2019s candidacy would confuse the electorate, to her prejudice. This case was docketed as SPA 09-104.The COMELEC, Second Division, called the trilogy to a joint hearing but opted to issue separate but simultaneous decisions because the Pamatong case, SPA 09-024, involved PGMA as a second respondent, while the two other cases [docketed as SPA Nos. 09-028 (DC) and 09-104 (DC)] only involved Erap as the respondent. Significantly, while three separate decisions were issued, they all commonly discussed, practically using the same wording, the pardon extended to Erap and concluded that the pardon restored Erap\u2019s \u201cright to vote and to be voted for a public office.\u201d[5]B.1. The Disqualification Rulings in the 2010 Election Cases.Thus, in clear and explicit terms, the Resolutions in all three cases uniformly ruled that Erap was not disqualified from running and from holding office, not only because he was not running for re-election, but likewise because of the pardon that had been extended to him.The COMELEC specifically ruled that the statement in the pardon stating that \u2013 \u201cWhereas, Joseph Estrada has publicly committed to no longer seek any elective position or office\u201d \u2013 was not really a condition but was merely a part of the pardon\u2019s preliminary statement. The dispositive portion of the pardon did not state that it was conditioned on this purported public commitment. Additionally, his public statement cannot serve to restrict the operation of, or prevail over, the explicit statement in the pardon that restored all his civil and political rights, including the right to vote and to be voted for a public office.[6]Petitioner Mary Lou Estrada pointedly questioned the COMELEC rulings in her motion for reconsideration, including the terms of the pardon extended to Erap.[7] Before the 2010 elections took place, the COMELEC en banc adopted the Second Division ruling and denied all the motions.[8] Only Pormento responded to the denial by filing a petition for certiorari before the Court, docketed as G.R. No. 191988.In resolving Pormento\u2019s petition, the Court solely touched on the issue of \u201cre-election\u201d and held that there was no longer any justiciable issue to be resolved because Erap had already lost the 2010 elections. Thus, the Court dismissed the whole petition, observing that Erap fully participated in the elections since Pormento did not pray for the issuance of a TRO.Pamatong and Mary Lou Estrada did not pursue further remedies after the COMELEC en banc denied their respective motions for reconsideration. This Court, on the other hand, dismissed Pormento\u2019s Rules 64/65 petition assailing the COMELEC ruling. Thus, the COMELEC ruling in the three cases became final, executory, non-appealable and non-assailable.[9]As I will discuss below, these final COMELEC decisions on Erap\u2019s pardon and his resulting qualification to run for elective public office preclude this same issue of pardon from again being questioned because res judicata has already set in.Significantly, when voting took place on May 10, 2010, no prohibition was in place to prevent the voters from voting for Erap as a candidate. Neither the COMELEC (because it had dismissed the petitions against Erap\u2019s candidacy) nor this Court (because it did not issue any temporary restraining order or injunction) prevented Erap from being voted upon. In a field of ten (10) candidates, Erap garnered 9,487,837 votes and landed in second place, as against the winner\u2019s 15,208,678 votes.[10]III.The Risos-Vidal PetitionOn October 2, 2012, Erap filed his Certificate of Candidacy (CoC) for the position of City Mayor of Manila. As had happened in the past, this Erap move did not go unchallenged.A. The COMELEC Petition.Petitioner Risos-Vidal filed on January 24, 2013 \u2013 or before the 2013 elections \u2013 a petition for disqualification against private respondent Erap based on Section 40[11] of the Local Government Code (R.A. No. 7160, the LGC) in relation with Section 12[12] of the Omnibus Election Code (B.P. No. 881, the OEC). Both the LGC and the OEC commonly disqualify any person convicted of an offense involving moral turpitude from running for office.She sought to disqualify Erap from running for mayor for having been convicted of a crime involving moral turpitude (plunder), an offense that carries the penalty of reclusion perpetua and the accessory penalties of interdiction and perpetual absolute disqualification. She alleged that Erap\u2019s subsequent pardon was conditional and did not cover the accessory penalty of perpetual absolute disqualification.Risos-Vidal and Erap fully argued the pardon aspect of the case before the COMELEC and before the Court. In Risos-Vidal\u2019s Memorandum that she submitted to the Court, she attached as Annex \u201cE\u201d the COMELEC Memorandum of Erap with the attached Pamatong,[13] Pormento[14] and Mary Lou Estrada[15] COMELEC resolutions.B. The COMELEC Ruling.On April 1, 2013 or 42 days before the 2013 elections, the COMELEC Second Division dismissed the petition for disqualification, citing its 2010 rulings in the cases filed against Erap after he filed his CoC for the position of President of the Philippines in 2010. According to the COMELEC, it had already ruled in these disqualification cases and had then held that the pardon granted to Erap was absolute and unconditional; hence, his previous conviction no longer barred him from running for an elective public office.The COMELEC en banc denied Risos-Vidal\u2019s motion for reconsideration,[16] prompting her to file the present petition for certiorari, where she alleged that the COMELEC gravely abused its discretion in issuing the assailed COMELEC resolutions.[17]While the petition was pending before the Court, the 2013 elections took place. Neither the COMELEC nor this Court barred Erap from running and being voted upon. He obtained 349,770 votes and was proclaimed as the \u201cduly elected\u201d Mayor on May 14, 2013. His opponent, Lim, obtained 313,764 votes and conceded that Erap had won.[18]C. The Lim Intervention.On June 7, 2013 \u2013 i.e., after the 2013 elections; Erap\u2019s proclamation as elected Mayor; his concession of the elections to Erap; and while the present petition was pending before the Court \u2013 Lim (Erap\u2019s opponent in the mayoralty race) filed a motion for leave to intervene, which motion the Court granted in a Resolution dated June 25, 2013.IV.The Issues for ResolutionThe main issue in this case is whether the COMELEC committed GRAVE ABUSE OF DISCRETION in ruling that Erap had been extended a PARDON that qualified him to run for City Mayor of Manila in the 2013 elections.Interrelated with this issue is the question of whether or not the COMELEC committed GRAVE ABUSE OF DISCRETION in dismissing the Risos-Vidal petition based on the 2010 COMELEC rulings that Erap\u2019s pardon restored his rights to vote and to be voted for a public office.Closely related to these main issues is the question of whether \u2013 based on the voting circumstances that surrounded the 2010 and 2013 elections \u2013 equitable reasons exist that should now prevent the Court from declaring Erap ineligible for the position to which he had been elected by the majority of Manila voters.Central to these issues is the determination of the nature and effects of the pardon granted to Erap, as well as the effects of all the developments in the case on the electorate \u2013 the innocent third party whose exercise of the democratic right to vote underlies the present dispute.A tangential side issue that should be settled for its jurisprudential value is the legal propriety of the intervention of Alfredo S. Lim only at the Supreme Court level.Other subsidiary issues must necessarily be resolved to get at the main and side issues. They shall all be topically identified in the course of resolving the leading issues.V.My Separate OpinionA. Preliminary Considerations.A.1. The Standard of Review in Considering the present petition.In the review of the COMELEC\u2019s ruling on the Risos-Vidal petition, an issue that we must settle at the outset is the nature and extent of the review we shall undertake. This determination is important so that everyone \u2013 both the direct parties as well as the voting public \u2013 will know and understand how this case was decided and that the Court had not engaged in any kind of \u201coverreach.\u201dSection 7, Article IX of the Constitution provides that \u201cunless otherwise provided by this Constitution or by law, any decision, order or ruling of each Commission may be brought to the Supreme Court on certiorari by the aggrieved party.\u201d A similar provision was found in the 1973 Constitution.In Aratuc v. COMELEC (a 1979 case)[19] the Court clarified that unlike in the 1935 Constitution where the Court had the power of review over the decisions, orders and rulings of the COMELEC,[20] the 1973 Constitution changed the nature of this remedy from appellate review to certiorari.Aratuc explained that under the then existing Constitution and statutory provisions, the certiorari jurisdiction of the Court over orders, and decisions of the COMELEC was not as broad as it used to be and should be confined to instances of grave abuse of discretion amounting to patent and substantial denial of due process.[21]The Court further observed that these constitutional, statutory and jurisprudential changes show the definite intent to enhance and invigorate the role of the COMELEC as the independent constitutional body tasked to safeguard free, peaceful and honest elections. In other words, the limited reach and scope of certiorari, compared with appellate review, direct that utmost respect be given the COMELEC as the constitutional body given the charge of elections.[22]A.1(a) Certiorari v. Appeal.An appellate review includes the full consideration of the merits, demerits and errors of judgment in the decision under review, while certiorari deals exclusively with the presence or absence of grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack of jurisdiction that rendered the assailed decision or ruling a nullity; such kind of abuse is way beyond mere error in the assailed judgment or ruling, and is not necessarily present in a valid but erroneous decision.A.1(b) Grave Abuse of Discretion.The grave abuse of discretion that justifies the grant of certiorari involves a defect of jurisdiction brought about, among others, by an indifferent disregard for the law, arbitrariness and caprice, an omission to weigh pertinent considerations, or a decision arrived at without rational deliberation[23] - due process issues that rendered the decision or ruling void.Our 1987 Constitution maintained the same remedy of certiorari in the review of COMELEC decisions elevated to the Supreme Court as the Constitutional Convention deliberations show.[24] This constitutional provision has since then been reflected under Rules 64 and 65 of the Rules of Court.Aside from the jurisdictional element involved, another basic and important element to fully understand the remedy of certiorari, is that it applies to rulings that are not, or are no longer, appealable. Thus, certiorari is not an appeal that opens up the whole case for review; it is limited to a consideration of a specific aspect of the case, to determine if grave abuse of discretion had intervened.For example, it is a remedy that may be taken against an interlocutory order (or one that does not resolve the main disputed issue in the case and is thus not a final order on the merits of the case) that was issued with grave abuse of discretion. This is the remedy to address a denial of a bill of particulars[25] or of the right to bail[26] by the trial court in a criminal case. It is also the sole remedy available against a COMELEC ruling on the merits of a case as this ruling on the main disputed issue is considered by the Constitution and by the law to be final and non-appealable.[27]A.1(c) Application of the Stardards of Review to the COMELEC Ruling. To assail a COMELEC ruling, the assailing party must show that the final and inappealable ruling is void, not merely erroneous, because the COMELEC acted with grave abuse of discretion in considering the case or in issuing its ruling.Under our established jurisprudence, this grave abuse of discretion has been almost uniformly defined as a \"capricious or whimsical exercise of judgment as is equivalent to lack of jurisdiction.\" The abuse of discretion, to be grave, must be so patent and gross as to amount to an \"evasion of a positive duty or to a virtual refusal to perform a duty enjoined by law, or to act at all in contemplation of law, as where the power is exercised in an arbitrary and despotic manner by reason of passion and hostility.\"The present Erap case is an election case brought from a ruling of the COMELEC en banc to this Court as an independent action for certiorari under Rule 64 in relation with Rule 65 of the Rules of Court, and must perforce be judged under the above-discussed standards.The question before us is not simply whether the COMELEC erred in appreciating the nature of the pardon granted to Erap and in relying on its 2010 rulings on this matter; the question to ask is, even if the COMELEC did err, whether its error is to the point of grave abuse of discretion.1. The Interests of the Electorate.As I narrated above, the Erap story did not end with his crime and conviction. While he had undeniably committed a crime involving betrayal of the public trust, he was subsequently and lawfully pardoned for his misdeed. While jurisprudence may be divided on the effects of pardon (i.e. whether it erases both the guilt and the penalty), the various cases giving rise to this jurisprudence do not appear to have considered at all the election setting that presently confronts us.Where the crime from which the guilt resulted is not unknown and was in fact a very widely publicized event in the country when it happened, the subsequent electoral judgment of the people on the recipient of the executive clemency cannot and should not be lightly disregarded. People participation is the essence of democracy and we should be keenly aware of the people\u2019s voice and heed it to the extent that the law does not bar this course of action. In case of doubt, the sentiment that the people expressed should assume primacy.When the recipient of pardon is likewise the people\u2019s choice in an election held after the pardon, it is well to remember that pardon is an act of clemency and grace exercised to mitigate the harshness of the application of the law and should be understood in this spirit, i.e., in favor of the grantee whom the people themselves have adjudged and found acceptable.It ought not be forgotten that in two high profile elections, the State had allowed Erap to offer himself as a candidate without any legal bar and without notice to the voting public that a vote for him could be rendered useless and stray.In the 2010 presidential elections, he had offered himself as a presidential candidate and his candidacy was objected to, among others, because of the nature of the pardon extended to him. The COMELEC resolved the objection and he was voted upon without any formal notice of any legal bar to his candidacy. It is now a matter of record and history that he landed 2nd in these elections, in a field of ten (10) candidates, with 9,487,837 voting for him as against the winner who garnered 15,208,678 votes. To Erap\u2019s credit, he gracefully accepted his electoral defeat.[28]In 2013, he again ran for office. He won this time but a case was again filed against him with the COMELEC and the case eventually reached this Court. This is the present case.The COMELEC cleared Erap by election day of 2013, dismissing the disqualification case against him and ruling that the pardon granted to him restored his right to vote and to be voted upon. Notably, even this Court did not prevent Erap\u2019s candidacy and did not prevent him from being voted upon after his disqualification case was brought to this Court. Thus, the people went to the polls and voted Erap into office with no expectation that their votes could be rendered stray.Under these circumstances, we cannot and should not rashly rule on the basis of black letter law and jurisprudence that address only the fact of pardon; we cannot forget the election setting and simply disregard the interests of the voters in our ruling. While the people were not impleaded as direct parties to the case, we cannot gloss over their interests as they are the sovereign who cannot be disregarded in a democratic state like ours.2. The Intervention of former Mayor Alfredo S. Lim.I have included the intervention of former Mayor Alfredo S. Lim as a matter for Preliminary Consideration as it is an immaterial consideration under my position that the COMELEC did not gravely abuse its discretion in its assailed ruling. Despite its immateriality, I nevertheless discuss it in light of the Court\u2019s prior action approving his intervention, which court approval was an interlocutory order that is subject to the Court\u2019s final ruling on the merits of the case.I have to discuss the intervention, too, for jurisprudential reasons: this intervention, apparently granted without indepth consideration, may sow confusion into the jurisprudence that those who came before us in this Court took pains to put in order.2.a. Intervention in General.Intervention is a remedy whereby a third party, not originally impleaded in the proceedings, becomes a litigant in the case so that the intervenor could protect or preserve a right or interest that may be affected by the proceedings.The intervenor\u2019s interest must be actual, substantial, material, direct and immediate, and not simply contingent or expectant. It must be of such direct and immediate character that the intervenor will either gain or lose by the direct legal operation and effect of the judgment.As discussed below, there are also other equally important limitations and restrictions to consider before an intervention can be allowed, among them, the need for the intervention to be timely filed.2.b. The context of Lim\u2019s intervention.The timing and incidents of Lim\u2019s intervention are jurisprudentially interesting and, by themselves, speak loudly against his cause.The records of this case show that Lim never filed any petition to cancel Erap\u2019s CoC nor to disqualify him. Neither did he intervene in the COMELEC proceedings in the Risos-Vidal petition. Instead, Lim allowed Erap to continue as his rival candidate in the 2013 elections for Mayor of the City of Manila.It will be recalled that Risos-Vidal filed her petition for certiorari before this Court on April 30, 2013 (or before the May 13, 2013 elections). Lim likewise did not intervene at that point. Erap won in the elections and in fact, on May 14, 2013, Lim publicly announced that he respected and acknowledged the COMELEC\u2019s proclamation of Erap and wished him all the best.[29]On June 7, 2013 (25 days after the May 13, 21013 elections, or 24 days after Erap\u2019s proclamation, and 24 days likewise after Lim conceded victory to Erap), Lim then filed with this Court his motion for leave to intervene with the attached petition-in-intervention. His arguments were: 1) Erap was disqualified to run for public office as his pardon did not restore his rights to vote and to hold public office;[30] and 2) his intervention was still timely.Lim also argued that it would have been premature to intervene in the Risos-Vidal petition before the proclamation because had Erap\u2019s votes not then been counted, they would have been considered stray and intervention would have been unnecessary. Lim further argued that, in view of Erap\u2019s disqualification, he should be declared as the winner, having obtained the second highest number of votes. Lim also additionally alleged that he never conceded defeat, and the COMELEC committed grave abuse of discretion when it dismissed Risos-Vidal\u2019s petition for disqualification based on its 2010 rulings.[31]2.c. Lim\u2019s petition-in-intervention should be dismissed.Since Lim intervened only in the present petition for certiorari before this Court, the Rules of Court on intervention directly applies. Section 2, Rule 19 of the Rules of Court provides that the time to intervene is at any time before the rendition of judgment by the trial court.The Court explained in Ongco v. Dalisay[32] that \u201cthe period within which a person may intervene is restricted and after the lapse of the period set in Section 2, Rule 19, intervention will no longer be warranted. This is because, basically, intervention is not an independent action but is ancillary and supplemental to an existing litigation.\u201dIn Ongco,[33] the Court further traced the developments of the present rule on the period to file a motion for intervention. The former rule was that intervention may be allowed \"before or during a trial.\" Thus, there were Court rulings that a motion for leave to intervene may be filed \"before or during a trial,\" even on the day when the case is submitted for decision as long as it will not unduly delay the disposition of the case.[34] There were also rulings where the Court interpreted \u201ctrial\u201d in the restricted sense such that the Court upheld the denial of the motion for intervention when it was filed after the case had been submitted for decision.[35] In Lichauco v. CA,[36] intervention was allowed at any time after the rendition of the final judgment.[37] In one exceptional case,[38] the Court allowed the intervention in a case pending before it on appeal in order to avoid injustice.To cure these inconsistent rulings, the Court clarified in Ongco that \u201c[t]he uncertainty in these rulings has been eliminated by the present Section 2, Rule 19, which permits the filing of the motion to intervene at any time before the rendition of the judgment, in line with the ruling in Lichauco.[39]The justification for this amendment is that before judgment is rendered, the court, for good cause shown, may still allow the introduction of additional evidence as this is still within a liberal interpretation of the period for trial. Also, since no judgment has yet been rendered, the matter subject of the intervention may still be readily resolved and integrated in the judgment disposing of all claims in the case, without requiring an overall reassessment of these claims as would be the case if the judgment had already been rendered.[40]The Court held in Ongco that under the present rules, [t]he period within which a person may intervene is also restricted\u2026 after the lapse of this period, it will not be warranted anymore. This is because, basically, intervention is not an independent action but is ancillary and supplemental to an existing litigation.[41]The Court further held in Ongco that \u201cthere is wisdom in strictly enforcing the period set by Rule 19 of the Rules of Court for the filing of a motion for intervention. Otherwise, undue delay would result from many belated filings of motions for intervention after judgment has already been rendered, because a reassessment of claims would have to be done. Thus, those who slept on their lawfully granted privilege to intervene will be rewarded, while the original parties will be unduly prejudiced.\u201d[42]While the Court may have liberally relaxed the rule on intervention in some cases, a liberal approach cannot be made in the present case because of jurisdictional restrictions, further explained below.Other than these reasons, I add that under COMELEC rules, only \u201ca person allowed to initiate an action or proceeding may, before or during the trial of an action or proceeding, be permitted by the Commission, in its discretion, to intervene in such action or proceeding, if he has legal interest in the matter in litigation, or in the success of either of the parties, or an interest against both, or when he is so situated as to be adversely affected by such action or proceeding.\u201d Thus, Lim could have intervened at the COMELEC level before or during the hearing of the petition for disqualification that Risos-Vidal filed.The records show that Lim intervened only after Risos-Vidal filed the present petition for certiorari with the Court and not during the disqualification proceedings before the COMELEC. He was therefore never a party in the disqualification proceeding before the COMELEC and, consequently, has not presented any evidence to support his claims; nor was Erap ever given the chance to controvert Lim\u2019s claims before the COMELEC, the tribunal vested with the jurisdiction to settle the issues that he raised in his petition-in-intervention before the Court.From the perspective of Rule 65 of the Rules of Court, I add that because Lim was not a party before the COMELEC, he never had the chance to file a motion for reconsideration before that body \u2013 a constitutional and procedural requirement before a petition for certiorari may be filed before the Court.[43] As a non-party to the disqualification case before the COMELEC, he cannot be deemed an \u201caggrieved party\u201d who has earned the rights under Rule 65 to file a certiorari petition or to intervene to assail the COMELEC\u2019s decision. The Court, in particular, has no jurisdiction to grant the prayer of Lim to be declared as the winner, especially since the COMELEC never had the chance to rule on this in its assailed decision.The original jurisdiction to decide election disputes lies with the COMELEC, not with this Court.[44] Thus, any ruling from us in the first instance on who should sit as mayor (in the event we grant the Risos-Vidal petition) will constitute grave abuse of discretion. Unfortunately, no recourse is available from our ruling. This character of finality renders it very important for us to settle the Lim intervention correctly.At this juncture, I refer back to Ongco, where the Court held that the filing of a motion for intervention with the CA after the MTC had rendered judgment is an inexcusable delay and is a sufficient ground for denying a motion for intervention.[45]Note that in Ongco, the Court still upheld the CA\u2019s denial of the motion for intervention and strictly applied the period to intervene even if what was involved was an appeal or a continuation of the proceedings of the trial court.In contrast, the present case is not a continuation of the COMELEC proceedings and decision, but an original special civil action of certiorari. Thus, with more reason should the rules on intervention be more stringently applied, given too that the Court has no original jurisdiction over the issues involved in the requested intervention, in particular, over the issue of who should sit as Mayor of the City of Manila if Risos-Vidal petition would be granted.As my last two points on the requested intervention, I would deny the intervention even if it technically satisfies the rules by reason of the estoppel that set in when Lim publicly announced that he was acknowledging and respecting Erap\u2019s proclamation. This public announcement is an admission against his interest that, in a proper case, would be admissible against Lim.I also disregard outright, for lack of relevance, the cases that Lim cited regarding intervention. In his cited Maquiling v. COMELEC[46] and Aratea v. COMELEC[47] cases, the intervenors filed their intervention before the COMELEC and not before the Court. Thus, any reliance on these cases would be misplaced.In sum, I maintain that Lim should be barred from participating in the present case as intervenor. Otherwise, the Court will effectively throw out of the window the jurisprudence that has developed on intervention, while disregarding as well the sound and applicable COMELEC rules on the same topic.VI.The Merits of the PetitionA.On the Issue of Pardon and the COMELEC\u2019s Grave Abuse of Discretion.The COMELEC did not err at all and thus could not have committed grave abuse of discretion in its ruling that the terms of Erap\u2019s pardon restored to him the right to vote and to be voted upon. Too, the COMELEC did not gravely abuse its discretion in dismissing the petition of Risos-Vidal and in citing its 2010 final and executory rulings that Erap\u2019s pardon restored his right to vote and be voted upon.A.1. Pardoning Power and the Pardon Extended.Section 19, Article VII of the Constitution provides for the pardoning power of the President. It states that except in cases of impeachment, or as otherwise provided in this Constitution, the President may grant reprieves, commutations, and pardons, and remit fines and forfeitures, after conviction by final judgment.Pardon is defined as an act of grace, proceeding from the power entrusted with the execution of the laws, which exempts the individual, on whom it is bestowed, from the punishment that the law inflicts for a crime he has committed.[48]The power to pardon, when exercised by the Chief Executive in favor of persons convicted of public crimes, is plenary, limited only by the terms of the Constitution; its exercise within these limits is otherwise absolute and fully discretionary. The reasons for its exercise are not open to judicial inquiry or review, and indeed it would appear that he may act without any reason, or at least without any expressed reason, in support of his action.[49]Where appropriate, however, his acts may be subject to the expanded jurisdiction of the Court under Article VIII, Section 1, paragraph 2 of the Constitution. This jurisdiction may be triggered, for example, if the President acts outside, or in excess, of the limits of the pardoning power granted him, as when he extends a pardon for a crime as yet not committed or when he extends a pardon before conviction.[50]Llamas v. Orbos,[51] a 1991 case, discussed the extent and scope of the President\u2019s pardoning power:During the deliberations of the Constitutional Commission, a subject of deliberations was the proposed amendment to Art. VII, Sec. 19 which reads as follows: \u201cHowever, the power to grant executive clemency for violation of corrupt practices laws may be limited by legislation.\u201d The Constitutional Commission, however, voted to remove the amendment, since it was in derogation of the powers of the President. As Mr. Natividad stated:I am also against this provision which will again chip more powers from the President. In case of other criminals convicted in our society we extend probation to them while in this case, they have already been convicted and we offer mercy. The only way we can offer mercy to them is through this executive clemency extended to them by the President. If we still close this avenue to them, they would be prejudiced even worse than the murderers and the more vicious killers in our society x x x.The proposal was primarily intended to prevent the President from protecting his cronies. Manifestly, however, the Commission preferred to trust in the discretion of Presidents and refrained from putting additional limitations on his clemency powers. (II RECORD of the Constitutional Commission, 392, 418-419, 524-525)It is evident from the intent of the Constitutional Commission, therefore, that the President's executive clemency powers may not be limited in terms of coverage, except as already provided in the Constitution, that is, \"no pardon, amnesty, parole, or suspension of sentence for violation of election laws, rules and regulations shall be granted by the President without the favorable recommendation of the COMELEC\" (Article IX, C, Section 5, Constitution). If those already adjudged guilty criminally in court may be pardoned, those adjudged guilty administratively should likewise be extended the same benefit. [Emphasis supplied]In considering and interpreting the terms of the pardon therefore, the starting point for analysis is the position that the President\u2019s power is full and plenary, save only for the textual limits under the Constitution. In the exercise of this power, too, it is not unreasonable to conclude, in the absence of any plain and expressed contrary intention, that the President exercised the full scope of his power.A.2. Structural Examination of the Erap Pardon.The whole text of the pardon that PGMA granted states:WHEREAS, this Administration has a policy of releasing inmates who have reached the age of seventy (70),WHEREAS, Joseph Ejercito Estrada has been under detention for six and half years,WHEREAS, Joseph Ejercito Estrada has publicly committed to no longer seek any elective position or office,IN VIEW HEREOF and pursuant to the authority conferred upon me by the Constitution, I hereby grant executive clemency to JOSEPH EJERCITO ESTRADA, convicted by the Sandiganbayan of Plunder and imposed a penalty of Reclusion Perpetua. He is hereby restored to his civil and political rights.The forfeitures imposed by the Sandiganbayan remain in force and in full, including all writs and processes issued by the Sandiganbayan in pursuance hereof, except for the bank account(s) he owned before his tenure as President.Upon acceptance of this pardon by JOSEPH EJERCITO ESTRADA, this pardon shall take effect.Structurally, this grant is composed of two parts, namely, the introductory Whereas Clauses consisting of three (3) paragraphs, and the Dispositive or Command portion which defines the clemency extended and commands its implementation.In issuing a pardon, the President not only exercises his full discretion but likewise directs and gives notice to all \u2013 the recipient, the officials and entities concerned \u2013 that the recipient should now be released and his disqualification lifted, pursuant to the terms of the pardon. In this sense, the structure of the written pardon assumes importance as pardon has to be implemented in accordance with its express terms and is no different in this sense from a judicial decision that likewise must be implemented.In judicial decisions, the Court\u2019s resolution on a given issue before it is always embodied in the decision or order\u2019s fallo or dispositive portion.[52] It is the directive part of the decision or order which must be enforced or, in legal parlance, subjected to execution. A court that issues an order of execution contrary to the terms of its final judgment exceeds its jurisdiction, thus rendering its order invalid.[53] Hence, the order of execution should always follow the terms of the fallo or dispositive portion.Other than the fallo, a decision or executory order contains a body \u2013 the court\u2019s opinion \u2013 explaining and discussing the decision. This opinion serves as the reason for the decision or order embodied in the fallo. In legalese, this opinion embodies the decision\u2019s ratio decidendi[54] or the matter or issue directly ruled upon and the terms and reasons for the ruling.The decision\u2019s structure has given rise in certain instances to conflicts, or at the very least, to ambiguities that clouded the implementation of the decision. In Gonzales v. Solid Cement Corporation,[55] this Court laid down the rule when these instances occur: in a conflict between the body of the decision and its fallo or dispositive portion, the rule is:The resolution of the court in a given issue \u2013 embodied in the fallo or dispositive part of a decision or order \u2013 is the controlling factor in resolving the issues in a case. The fallo embodies the court\u2019s decisive action on the issue/s posed, and is thus the part of the decision that must be enforced during execution. The other parts of the decision only contain, and are aptly called, the ratio decidendi (or reason for the decision) and, in this sense, assume a lesser role in carrying into effect the tribunal\u2019s disposition of the case.When a conflict exists between the dispositive portion and the opinion of the court in the text or body of the decision, the former must prevail over the latter under the rule that the dispositive portion is the definitive order, while the opinion is merely an explanatory statement without the effect of a directive. Hence, the execution must conform with what the fallo or dispositive portion of the decision ordains or decrees.[56] [Emphasis supplied]Thus, the body of the decision (or opinion portion) carries no commanding effect; the fallo or dispositive portion carries the definite directive that prevails over whatever is written in the opinion of the court. The body contains the reasons or conclusions of the court, but orders nothing; execution springs from the fallo or dispositive portion, not from the decision\u2019s body or opinion portion. In short, the fallo or dispositive portion prevails in case of conflict.I say all these, aware that in Cobarrubias v. People,[57] the Court made an exception to the general rule that the fallo or dispositive portion always prevails over the decision or order\u2019s body. The exception is when one can clearly and unquestionably conclude, based on the body of the decision and its discussions, that a mistake had been committed in formulating the dispositive portion. In such cases, reason dictates that the body of the decision should prevail.[58]This contrary Cobarrubias result, to be properly understood, must be read and considered in its factual context. In this case, the court itself made a blatant mistake in the dispositive portion as it mixed up the criminal docket case numbers, thus resulting in the erroneous dismissal of the wrong criminal case. Since the decision\u2019s body very clearly discussed which criminal case should be dismissed, the Court then held that the body should prevail over the dispositive portion. In other words, when the decision\u2019s intent is beyond doubt and is very clear but was simply beclouded by an intervening mistake, then the body of the decision must prevail.A pardon, as an expression of an executive policy decision that must be enforced, hews closely to the structure of a court decision. Their structures run parallel with each other, with the Whereas Clauses briefly stating the considerations recognized and, possibly, the intents and purposes considered, in arriving at the directive to pardon and release a convicted prisoner.Thus, while a pardon\u2019s introductory or Whereas Clauses may be considered in reading the pardon (in the manner that the opinion portion of a court decision is read), these whereas clauses \u2013 as a rule \u2013 cannot also significantly affect the pardon\u2019s dispositive portion. They can only do so and in fact may even prevail, but a clear and patent reason indicating a mistake in the grantor\u2019s intent must be shown, as had happened in Cobarrubias where a mistake intervened in the fallo.A.3. The Pardon Extended to Erap Examined.A.3(a) The Decision Convicting Erap.To fully understand the terms of the granted executive clemency, reference should be made to the September 12, 2007 decision of the Sandiganbayan which states:WHEREFORE, in view of all the foregoing, judgment is hereby rendered in Criminal Case No. 26558 finding the accused, Former President Joseph Ejercito Estrada, GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of PLUNDER, defined in and penalized by Republic Act No. 7080, as amended. On the other hand, for failure of the prosecution to prove and establish their guilt beyond reasonable doubt, the Court finds the accused Jose \u201cJinggoy\u201d Estrada and Atty. Edward S. Serapio NOT GUILTY of the crime of plunder and, accordingly, the Court hereby orders their ACQUITTAL.The penalty imposable for the crime of plunder under Republic Act No. 7080, as amended by Republic Act No. 7659, is Reclusion Perpetua to Death. There being no aggravating or mitigating circumstances, however, the lesser penalty shall be applied in accordance with Article 63 of the Revised Penal Code. Accordingly, the accused Former President Joseph Ejercito Estrada is hereby sentenced to suffer the penalty of Reclusion Perpetua and the accessory penalties of civil interdiction during the period of sentence and perpetual absolute disqualification.The period within which accused Former President Joseph Ejercito Estrada has been under detention shall be credited to him in full as long as he agrees voluntarily in writing to abide by the same disciplinary rules imposed upon convicted prisoners.Moreover, in accordance with Section 2 of Republic Act No. 7080, as amended by Republic Act No. 7659, the Court hereby declares the forfeiture in favor of the government of the following:(1) The total amount of Five Hundred Forty Two Million Seven Hundred Ninety One Thousand Pesos (P545,291,000.00), with interest and income earned, inclusive of the amount of Two Hundred Million Pesos (P200,000,000.00), deposited in the name and account of the Erap Muslim Youth Foundation.(2) The amount of One Hundred Eighty Nine Million Pesos (P189,000,000.00), inclusive of interests and income earned, deposited in the Jose Velarde account.(3) The real property consisting of a house and lot dubbed as Boracay Mansion located at #100 11th Street, New Manila, Quezon City.The cash bonds posted by accused Jose Jinggoy Estrada and Atty. Edward S. Serapio are hereby ordered cancelled and released to the said accused or their duly authorized representatives upon presentation of the original receipt evidencing payment thereof and subject to the usual accounting and auditing procedures. Likewise, the hold-departure orders issued against the said accused are hereby recalled and declared functus officio.SO ORDERED.A.3(b) The Pardon in light of the Judgment of Conviction.This judgment has several components, namely: the finding of guilt; the principal penalty of imprisonment imposed; the inherent accessory penalties; the confiscation and forfeitures; and the disposition of the cash bonds that the acquitted accused filed.Of these, actions on the forfeitures and the cash bonds have apparently been recognized as completed pursuant to Article 45 of the RPC, and have been expressly excluded from the executive clemency.[59] Thus, what remained for the executive clemency to touch upon were the principal and the accessory penalties that were outstanding, i.e., the remaining terms of the imprisonment; and the accessory penalties decreeing that Erap is \u201crestored to his civil and political rights.\u201dB.The Risos-Vidal\u2019sObjections Relating to Pardon.The Risos-Vidal petition sows confusion into the plain terms of the executive clemency by arguing that: first, the Third Whereas Clause (referring to Erap\u2019s public commitment that he would no longer seek public office) in fact embodies a condition for the grant of the executive clemency; and second, no express restoration of the right to hold public office and to suffrage was made as the \u201crestoration\u201d was under general terms that did not cover these specific rights.B.1. Refutation of the Risos-Vidal Objections.B.1(a) \u201cAbsolute Pardon\u201d as Officially Defined.A ready reference to understand a pardon is its official definition under the applicable law and applicable rules and regulations. The definition of absolute pardon appears in the rules and regulations of the Board of Pardons and Parole (BPP).[60] The BPP is the constituent office in the Executive Department[61] responsible for the handling of cases of pardon upon petition, or any referral by the Office of the President on pardons and parole, or motu propio.[62] In other words, the BPP is the foremost authority on what its title plainly states \u2013 pardons and paroles.Under the BPP\u2019s Revised Rules and Regulations, \u201cabsolute pardon\u201d refers \u201cto the total extinction of the criminal liability of the individual to whom it is granted without any condition. It restores to the individual his civil and political rights and remits the penalty imposed for the particular offense of which he was convicted.\u201d[63]Aside from absolute pardon, there is the conditional pardon[64] which is defined as \u201cthe exemption of an individual, within certain limits or conditions, from the punishment which the law inflicts for the offense he had committed resulting in the partial extinction of his criminal liability.\u201dThese are the authoritative guidelines in determining the nature and extent of the pardon the President grants, i.e., whether it is absolute or conditional. To stress, the BPP is the body that investigates and recommends to the President whether or not a pardon should be granted to a convict, and that closely coordinates with the Office of the President on matters of pardons and parole.Even a cursory examination of the Erap pardon and the BPP Rules would show that the wordings of the pardon, particularly on civil and political rights, carried the wordings of the BPP Rules. Thus, Erap\u2019s pardon states:IN VIEW HEREOF, and pursuant to the authority conferred upon me by the Constitution, I hereby grant executive clemency to JOSEPH EJERCITO ESTRADA, convicted by the Sandiganbayan of Plunder and imposed a penalty of Reclusion Perpetua. He is hereby restored to his civil and political rights.In these lights, when PGMA (as President and Head of the Executive Department to which the BPP belongs) granted Erap executive clemency and used the words of the BPP rules and regulations, she raised the inference that her grant was in the spirit in which the terms of the pardon are understood in the BPP rules.In other words, she clearly intended the granted pardon to be absolute. Thus, the pardon granted totally extinguished the criminal liability of Erap, including the accessory penalty of perpetual absolute disqualification. It cannot be otherwise under the plain and unequivocal wording of the definition of absolute pardon, and the statement in the pardon that Erap is restored to his civil and political rights.B.2. The Third Whereas Clause as a Condition.The pardon extended to Erap was very briefly worded. After three short Whereas Clauses referring to: the Administration policy on the release of inmates;[65] the period Erap had been under detention;[66] and Erap\u2019s attributed past statement publicly committing that he would \u201cno longer seek any elective position,[67] the pardon proceeds to its main directives touching on the principal penalty of reclusion perpetua and the accessory penalties by expressly restoring Erap\u2019s civil and political rights.Unlike in a court decision where the ratio decidendi fully expounds on the presented issues and leads up to the dispositive portion, the Whereas Clauses all related to Erap but did not, singly or collectively, necessarily indicate that they are conditions that Erap must comply with for the continued validity of his pardon.Notably, the first two Whereas Clauses are pure statements of fact that the grantor recognized, referring as they do to an administration policy and to the age of Erap.The statement on the administration policy of releasing convicts who are 70 years old, to be sure, could not have been intended to be conditional so that a future change of policy or a mistake in Erap\u2019s age would have led to the invalidity of the pardon. Purely and simply, these two Whereas clauses were nothing more than statements of fact that the grantor recognized in the course of considering the pardon and they were never intended to operate as conditions.The third Whereas Clause, one of the three clauses that the pardon contains, is similarly a statement of fact \u2013 what Erap had publicly committed in the past, i.e., that he would no longer seek public office. Such a statement would not be strange coming from a 70-year-old man convicted of plunder and sentenced to reclusion perpetua (literally, life imprisonment) and who, in the ordinary course, looks forward to an extended prison term. Under these conditions, he could easily say he would not seek political office again.Of course, because the statement, standing by itself, can be equivocal, it can also be read with a bias against Erap and be understood to be a promise or a \u201ccommitment.\u201d The plain reality, however, is that this clause does not bear the required context that would lead to this conclusion, and is totality lacking in any indicator that would make it a condition for the pardon. In short, a clear link to this kind of conclusion is plainly missing.This link, for example, would have been there and would have radically changed the meaning of this Whereas clause had it stated that Erap publicly committed that, if pardoned, he would not seek public office. No such link, however, appears in the body of the pardon, nor is any evidence available from the records of the case, to show that a promissory commitment had been made and adopted by PGMA, as grantor.Thus, as matters stand, the third Whereas clause stands in the same footing and should be characterized in the same manner that the two other clauses are characterized: singly or collectively, they are simply declarations of what the grantor recognized as facts at the time the pardon was granted. In the manner the Court spoke of preambles in the case of Kuwait Airways Corporation v. Philippine Airlines, Inc.,[68] the Whereas clauses merely manifest considerations that cannot be the origin of rights and obligations[69] and cannot make the Erap pardon conditional.Simply as an aside (as I feel the topic does not deserve any extended consideration), I do not believe that the \u201cacceptance\u201d of the pardon is important in the determination of whether the pardon extended is absolute or conditional.Irrespective of the nature of the pardon, the moment the convict avails of the clemency granted, with or without written acceptance, then the pardon is already accepted. If this is to be the standard to determine the classification of the pardon, then there would hardly be any absolute pardon; upon his release, the pardon is deemed accepted and therefore conditional.If an express acceptance would serve a useful purpose at all, it is in the binding effect that this acceptance would put in place. As in the case of an appointment, a pardon can be withdrawn at any time before it is accepted by the grantor. Acceptance would thus be the means to tie the grantor to the grant.What is important, to my mind, is proof of the communication of the pardon to the convict, in the cases when terms and conditions are attached to the pardon. Communications of these terms, and proof that the convict availed himself of the granted clemency, would suffice to conclude that the terms and conditions had been accepted and should be observed.B.3. Any Doubt Should Take Popular Vote into Account.At most, I can grant in a very objective reading of the bare terms of the third Whereas clause that it can admit of various interpretations. Any interpretative exercise, however, in order to be meaningful and conclusive must bring into play relevant interpretative aids, even those extraneous to the pardon, such as the events that transpired since the grant of the pardon. This case, in particular, the most relevant interpretative aids would be the two elections where Erap had been a candidate, the electorate\u2019s choices, and the significant number who voted in good faith to elect Erap.In 2010, this number was sizeable but Erap only landed in second place with a vote of 9,487,837 in a field of ten (10) candidates. This result though cannot but be given appropriate recognition since the elections were nationwide and Erap\u2019s conviction and pardon were issues used against him.In the 2013 elections (where Erap\u2019s qualification is presently being contested), the results were different; he garnered sufficient votes to win, beating the incumbent in this electoral fight for the premiere post in the City of Manila.Under these circumstances, no reason exists to disregard the popular vote, given that it is the only certain determinant under the uncertainty that petitioner Risos-Vidal NOW TRIES to introduce in the present case. If this is done and the popular vote is considered together with the official definition of pardon under the BPP regulations, the conclusion cannot but be the recognition by this Court that Erap had been given back his right to vote and be voted upon.B.3(a) The Express Restoration of the Right to Hold Office. The petitioner Risos-Vidal in her second substantive objection posits that the pardon did not expressly include the right to hold office, relying on Article 36 of the RPC that provides:Pardon; its effects. \u2013 A pardon shall not work on the restoration of the right to hold public office or the right of suffrage, unless such rights be expressly restored by the terms of the pardon.To the petitioner, it was not sufficient that under the express terms of the pardon, Erap had been \u201crestored to his civil and political rights.\u201d Apparently, she wanted to find the exact wording of the above-quoted Article 36 or, as stated in her various submissions, that Erap should be restored to his \u201cfull\u201d civil and political rights.To set the records straight, what is before us is not a situation where a pardon was granted without including in the terms of the pardon the restoration of civil and political rights. What is before us is a pardon that expressly and pointedly restored these rights; only, the petitioner wants the restoration in her own terms.In raising this objection, the petitioner apparently refuses to accept the official definition of \u201cabsolute pardon\u201d pointed out above; she also fails or refuses to grasp the full import of what the term \u201ccivil and political rights\u201d connotes. The term traces its roots to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights[70] which in turn traces its genesis to the same process that led to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights to which the Philippines is a signatory.[71]Closer to home, Republic Act No. 9225 (The Citizenship Retention and Reacquisition Act of 2003) also speaks of \u201cCivil and Political Rights and Liabilities\u201d in its Section 5 by providing that \u201cThose who retain or re-acquire Philippine citizenship under this Act shall enjoy full civil and political rights and be subject to all the attendant liabilities and responsibilities under existing laws of the Philippines\u2026\u201d and in Section 5(5) mentions the \u201cright to vote and be elected or appointed to any public office in the Philippines x x x.\u201dIn Simon v. Commission on Human Rights,[72] the Court categorically explained the rights included under the term \u201ccivil and political rights,\u201d in the context of Section 18, Article XIII of the Constitution which provides for the Commission on Human Rights\u2019 power to investigate all forms of human rights violations involving civil and political rights.\u201dAccording to Simon, the term \u201ccivil rights,\u201d31 has been defined as referring (t)o those (rights) that belong to every citizen of the state or country, or, in wider sense, to all its inhabitants, and are not connected with the organization or administration of the government. They include the rights of property, marriage, equal protection of the laws, freedom of contract, etc. or, as otherwise defined, civil rights are rights appertaining to a person by virtue of his citizenship in a state or community. Such term may also refer, in its general sense, to rights capable of being enforced or redressed in a civil action. Also quite often mentioned are the guarantees against involuntary servitude, religious persecution, unreasonable searches and seizures, and imprisonment for debt.[73]Political rights, on the other hand, refer to the right to participate, directly or indirectly, in the establishment or administration of government, the right of suffrage, the right to hold public office, the right of petition and, in general, the rights appurtenant to citizenship vis-a-vis the management of government.[74]In my view, these distinctions and enumerations of the rights included in the term \u201ccivil and political rights,\u201d[75] as accepted internationally and domestically, are sufficiently clear and cannot be made the serious basis of the present objection, i.e., that further specification should be made in light of Article 36 of the RPC that requires the restoration of the rights of the right to suffrage and to hold office to be express. To insist on this argument is to require to be written into the pardon what is already there, in the futile attempt to defeat the clear intent of the pardon by mere play of words.B.3(a)(i) The RPC Perspectives.From the perspective of the RPC, it should be appreciated, as discussed above, that a conviction carries penalties with varying components. These are mainly the principal penalties and the accessory penalties.[76]Reclusion perpetua, the penalty imposed on Erap, carries with it the accessory penalty of civil interdiction for life or during the period of the sentence and that of perpetual absolute disqualification which the offender shall suffer even though pardoned as to the principal penalty, unless the same shall have been remitted in the pardon.[77]The full understanding of the full practical effects of pardon on the principal and the accessories penalties as embodied in the RPC, requires the combined reading of Articles 36 and 41 of the RPC, with Article 41 giving full meaning to the requirement of Article 36 that the restoration of the right to hold office be expressly made in a pardon if indeed this is the grantor\u2019s intent. An express mention has to be made of the restoration of the rights to vote and be voted for since a pardon with respect to the principal penalty would not have the effect of restoring these specific rights unless their specific restoration is expressly mentioned in the pardon.The Erap\u2019s pardon sought to comply with this RPC requirement by specifically stating that he was \u201crestored to his civil and political rights.\u201d I take the view that this restoration already includes the restoration of the right to vote and be voted for as these are rights subsumed within the \u201cpolitical rights\u201d that the pardon mentions; in the absence of any express accompanying reservation or contrary intent, this formulation grants a full restoration that is coterminous with the remitted principal penalty of reclusion perpetua.Risos-Vidal objects to this reading of Article 36 on the ground that Section 36[78] and 41[79] expressly require that the restoration be made specifically of the right to vote and to be voted upon. J. Leonen supports Risos-Vidal\u2019s arguments and opines that civil and political rights collectively constitute a bundle of rights and the rights to vote and to be voted upon are specific rights expressly singled out and required by these RPC articles and thus must be expressly restored. It posits too that these are requirements of form that do not diminish the pardoning power of the President.I note in this juncture that J. Leonen\u2019s position on the requirements of Articles 36 and 41, is a very literal reading of 80-year old provisions[80] whose interpretations have been overtaken by events and should now be updated. As I discussed above, technical meanings have since then attached to the term \u201ccivil and political rights,\u201d which meanings cannot be disregarded without doing violence to the safeguards that these rights have acquired over the years.In this age and time, \u201cpolitical rights\u201d cannot be understood meaningfully as rights with core values that our democratic system protects, if these rights will not include the right to vote and be voted for. To exclude the rights of suffrage and candidacy from the restoration of civil and political rights shall likewise signify a diminution, other than what the Constitution allows, of the scope of pardon that the President can extend under the 1987 Constitution. Significantly, this Constitution itself did not yet exist when the Revised Penal Code was passed so that this Code could not have taken into account the intent of the framers of this Constitution to maintain the plenary nature of the pardoning power.[81]B.3(a)(ii) Harmonization of Conflicting Provisions.Where seeming conflicts appear between or among provisions of law, particularly between a constitutional provision and a statute, the primary rule in understanding these seeming conflicts is to harmonize them, giving effect to both provisions within the limits of the constitutional provision.[82]As posed in this case, this seeming conflict occurs between the terms and intent of the current Constitution to give the President the full power to grant executive clemency, limited only by the terms of the Constitution itself, on the one hand, and the collective application of the Articles 36 and 41 of the RPC, on the other.In my view, harmonization occurs under the Erap pardon by giving due recognition to the essentially plenary nature of the President\u2019s pardoning power under Section 19, Article VII of the Constitution, while giving effect to the RPC intent to make clear in the terms of the pardon the intent to restore the convict\u2019s rights to vote and to be voted upon, as a matter of form that is satisfied by reference to the restoration of political rights that, as now understood internationally and domestically, include the restoration of the right to vote and to be voted upon. Understood in this manner, the RPC provisions would not be constitutionally infirm as they would not diminish the pardoning power of the President.To address another concern that J. Leonen expressed, no need exists to require the President to grant the \u201cfull\u201d restoration of Erap\u2019s civil and political rights as this kind of interpretation renders illusory the extent of the President\u2019s pardoning power by mere play of words. In the absence of any contrary intent, the use of the modifier \u201cfull\u201d is an unnecessary surplusage.B.3(a)(iii) The Monsanto v. Factoran Case.I also address J. Leonen\u2019s discussion of the Monsanto v. Factoran case.Part and parcel of the topic \u201cRPC Perspectives\u201d is the position that J. Leonen took in Monsanto \u2013 in the course of repudiating Cristobal v. Labrador,[83] Pelobello v. Palatino[84] and Ex Parte Garland.[85] J. Leonen took notice of the statement in Monsanto that \u201c[t]he better considered cases regard full pardon x x x as relieving the party from all the punitive consequences of his criminal act, including the disqualification or disabilities based on finding of guilt.\u201d J. Leonen went on to state that this \u201cincluding phrase or inclusion\u201d is not an authority in concluding that the grant of pardon ipso facto remits the accessory disqualifications or disabilities imposed on a convict regardless of whether the remission was explicitly stated,[86] citing the following reasons:First, J. Leonen maintains that the inclusion was not a pronouncement of a prevailing rule but was merely a statement made in the course of a comparative survey of cases during which the Court manifested a preference for \u201cauthorities [that reject] the unduly broad language of the Garland case.\u201d[87]Second, the footnote to the inclusion indicates that Monsanto relied on a case decided by a United States court. Thus, Monsanto was never meant as a summation of the controlling principles in this jurisdiction and did not consider Articles 36 and 41 of the RPC.Lastly, J. Leonen argues that even granting that the inclusion articulated a rule, this inclusion, made in 1989, must be deemed to have been abandoned, in light of the Court\u2019s more recent pronouncements - in 1997, in People v. Casido,[88] and in 2000, in People v. Patriarca[89]- which cited with approval this Court\u2019s statement in Barrioquinto v. Fernandez.[90]J. Leonen added that the Monsanto inclusion must also be deemed superseded by the Court\u2019s ruling in Romeo Jalosjos v. COMELEC[91] which recognized that \u201cone who is previously convicted of a crime punishable by reclusion perpetua or reclusion temporal continues to suffer the accessory penalty of perpetual absolute disqualification even though pardoned as to the principal penalty, unless the accessory penalty shall have been expressly remitted in the pardon.\u201dI disagree with these positions, particularly with the statement that the Monsanto inclusion was overturned by Casido, Patriarca (citing Barrioquinto) and Romeo Jalosjos.I maintain that the inclusion was the ratio decidendi of the case and was not just a passing statement of the Court. In Monsanto, the Court emphasized that a pardon may remit all the penal consequences of a criminal indictment.[92] The Court even applied this statement by categorically ruling that the full pardon granted to Monsanto \u201chas resulted in removing her disqualification from holding public employment.\u201d[93] In fact, J. Leonen\u2019s interpretation of Monsanto is misleading; his conclusion on the superiority of Casido, Patriarca and Jalosjos over Monsanto is likewise misplaced and without basis.For clarity, the inclusion phrase is part of the Court\u2019s discussion in Monsanto and was made in the context that although the Court repudiated the Garland ruling (as cited in Pellobello and Cristobal) that pardon erases the guilt of the convict, the Court still acknowledged that pardon may remove all the punitive consequences of a convict\u2019s criminal act, including the disqualifications or disabilities based on the finding of guilt.[94]The complete discussion of the Court in Monsanto where J. Leonen selectively lifted the inclusion for his own purposes is as follows:[95]Having disposed of that preliminary point, we proceed to discuss the effects of a full and absolute pardon in relation to the decisive question of whether or not the plenary pardon had the effect of removing the disqualifications prescribed by the Revised Penal Code.x x x xThe Pelobello v. Palatino and Cristobal v. Labrador cases, and several others show the unmistakable application of the doctrinal case of Ex Parte Garland, whose sweeping generalizations to this day continue to hold sway in our jurisprudence despite the fact that much of its relevance has been downplayed by later American decisions. Consider the following broad statements:A pardon reaches both the punishment prescribed for the offense and the guilt of the offender; and when the pardon is full, it releases the punishment and blots out of existence the guilt, so that in the eye of the law the offender is as innocent as if he had never committed the offense. If granted before conviction, it prevents any of the penalties and disabilities, consequent upon conviction, from attaching; if granted after conviction, it removes the penalties and disabilities and restores him to all his civil rights; it makes him, as it were, a new man, and gives him a new credit and capacity.Such generalities have not been universally accepted, recognized or approved. The modern trend of authorities now rejects the unduly broad language of the Garland case (reputed to be perhaps the most extreme statement which has been made on the effects of a pardon). To our mind, this is the more realistic approach. While a pardon has generally been regarded as blotting out the existence of guilt so that in the eye of the law the offender is as innocent as though he never committed the offense, it does not operate for all purposes. The very essence of a pardon is forgiveness or remission of guilt. Pardon implies guilt. It does not erase the fact of the commission of the crime and the conviction thereof. It does not wash out the moral stain. It involves forgiveness and not forgetfulness.The better considered cases regard full pardon (at least one not based on the offender's innocence) as relieving the party from all the punitive consequences of his criminal act, including the disqualifications or disabilities based on the finding of guilt. But it relieves him from nothing more. \"To say, however, that the offender is a \"new man\", and \"as innocent as if he had never committed the offense;\" is to ignore the difference between the crime and the criminal. A person adjudged guilty of an offense is a convicted criminal, though pardoned; he may be deserving of punishment, though left unpunished; and the law may regard him as more dangerous to society than one never found guilty of crime, though it places no restraints upon him following his conviction.\u201dx x x xIn this ponencia, the Court wishes to stress one vital point: While we are prepared to concede that pardon may remit all the penal consequences of a criminal indictment if only to give meaning to the fiat that a pardon, being a presidential prerogative, should not be circumscribed by legislative action, we do not subscribe to the fictitious belief that pardon blots out the guilt of an individual and that once he is absolved, he should be treated as if he were innocent. For whatever may have been the judicial dicta in the past, we cannot perceive how pardon can produce such \"moral changes\" as to equate a pardoned convict in character and conduct with one who has constantly maintained the mark of a good, law-abiding citizen.x x x xPardon granted after conviction frees the individual from all the penalties and legal disabilities and restores him to all his civil rights. But unless expressly grounded on the person's innocence (which is rare), it cannot bring back lost reputation for honesty, integrity and fair dealing. This must be constantly kept in mind lest we lose track of the true character and purpose of the privilege.Thus, notwithstanding the expansive and effusive language of the Garland case, we are in full agreement with the commonly-held opinion that pardon does not ipso facto restore a convicted felon to public office necessarily relinquished or forfeited by reason of the conviction although such pardon undoubtedly restores his eligibility for appointment to that office.x x x xFor petitioner Monsanto, this is the bottom line: the absolute disqualification or ineligibility from public office forms part of the punishment prescribed by the Revised Penal Code for estafa thru falsification of public documents. It is clear from the authorities referred to that when her guilt and punishment were expunged by her pardon, this particular disability was likewise removed. Henceforth, petitioner may apply for reappointment to the office which was forfeited by reason of her conviction. And in considering her qualifications and suitability for the public post, the facts constituting her offense must be and should be evaluated and taken into account to determine ultimately whether she can once again be entrusted with public funds. Stated differently, the pardon granted to petitioner has resulted in removing her disqualification from holding public employment but it cannot go beyond that. To regain her former post as assistant city treasurer, she must re-apply and undergo the usual procedure required for a new appointment. [Emphasis and underscoring supplied; citations omitted]As against J. Leonen\u2019s interpretation of the Monsanto ruling above, I deduce the following contrary points:First, contrary to J. Leonen\u2019s statement, the Court took into consideration the provisions of the RPC in arriving at its ruling in Monsanto.To reiterate, Monsanto exhaustively discussed the effects of a full and absolute pardon on the accessory penalty of disqualification. Hence, the Court ruled that the full pardon granted to Monsanto resulted in removing her disqualification from holding public employment under the RPC but did not result in her automatic reinstatement as Assistant City Treasurer due to the repudiation of the Garland ruling cited in Pelobello and Labrador.In contrast, the ruling of the Court in Casido[96] and Patriarca,[97] which both cited Barrioquinto,[98] all related to amnesty and not to pardon. The paragraph in Casido and Patriarca that J. Leonen quoted to contradict the Monsanto inclusion is part of the Court\u2019s attempt in Casido and Patriarca to distinguish amnesty from pardon.For clarity, below is the complete paragraph in Casido[99] and Patriarca[100] where J. Leonen lifted the portion (highlighted in bold) that he used to contradict the Monsanto inclusion:The theory of the respondents, supported by the dissenting opinion, is predicated on a wrong contention of the nature or character of an amnesty. Amnesty must be distinguished from pardon.Pardon is granted by the Chief Executive and as such it is a private act which must be pleaded and proved by the person pardoned, because the courts take no notice thereof; while amnesty by Proclamation of the Chief Executive with the concurrence of Congress, and it is a public act of which the courts should take judicial notice. Pardon is granted to one after conviction; while amnesty is to classes of persons or communities who may be guilty of political offenses, generally before or after the institution of the criminal prosecution and sometimes after conviction. Pardon looks forward and relieves the offender from the consequences of an offense of which he has been convicted, that is, it abolishes or forgives the punishment, and for that reason it does \"nor work the restoration of the rights to hold public office, or the right of suffrage, unless such rights be expressly restored by the terms of the pardon,\" and it \"in no case exempts the culprit from the payment of the civil indemnity imposed upon him by the sentence\" (article 36, Revised Penal Code). While amnesty looks backward and abolishes and puts into oblivion the offense itself, it so overlooks and obliterates the offense with which he is charged that the person released by amnesty stands before the law precisely as though he had committed no offense.[101] [Emphasis supplied]As between Monsanto, involving a full pardon, and the three amnesty cases (Casido, Patriarca and Barrioquinto), Monsanto clearly applies to the pardon that is involved in the present case where the dispositive portion made a restoration of Erap\u2019s civil and political rights. Note that the pardon described in the amnesty cases does not even identify whether the pardon being described was absolute or conditional. In fact, the portion cited by the majority in the amnesty cases merely repeated what Article 36 of the RPC provides. Monsanto, on the other hand and to the contrary, took into consideration these RPC provisions on disqualifications in relation with the effects of a full pardon.From this perspective, J. Leonen is thus careless and misleading in immediately concluding that the Monsanto ruling on \u201cinclusion\u201d was overturned by the amnesty cases.Similarly, contrary to J. Leonen\u2019s argument, the ruling in Romeo Jalosjos v. COMELEC (Jalosjos) did not supersede the Monsanto ruling cited above.In Jalosjos,[102] the Court merely reconciled the apparent conflict between Section 40(a)[103] of the Local Government Code and Article 30[104] of the RPC, which provides for the effects of perpetual or temporary absolute disqualification.The Court held in Jalosjos that Article 41 of the RPC expressly states that one who was previously convicted of a crime punishable by reclusion perpetua or reclusion temporal continues to suffer the accessory penalty of perpetual absolute disqualification even though pardoned as to the principal penalty, unless this accessory penalty had been expressly remitted in the pardon. In Jalosjos, the accessory penalty had not been expressly remitted in the Order of Commutation or by any subsequent pardon; hence, Jalosjos\u2019 disqualification to run for elective office was deemed to subsist.[105]Jalosjos could be harmonized with Monsanto in that the latter also recognized the provisions of the RPC on the accessory penalty of disqualification but holds that the full pardon remits this disqualification.In the present case, Erap\u2019s pardon fully complied with the RPC requirements for the express remission of the accessory penalty of perpetual absolute disqualification as the pardon in fact restored him to his civil and political rights. In this light, the Monsanto ruling still applies: while the PGMA pardon does not erase Erap\u2019s guilt, it nonetheless remitted his disqualification to run for public office and to vote as it expressly restored him to his civil and political rights.The Office of the Solicitor General succinctly expressed the Monsanto ratio decidendi when it said that the Court, despite ruling against Monsanto, \u201cnevertheless reaffirmed the well-settled doctrine that the grant of pardon also removes one\u2019s absolute disqualification or ineligibility to hold public office.\u201dB.3(b) Arguments via the Interpretative Route.Alternatively, if indeed the third Whereas clause had injected doubt in the express and unequivocal restoration made, then two interpretative recourses can be made to determine how this doubt can be resolved.B.3(b)(i) The Liberal Mode of Interpretation.The first approach is to use by analogy the ruling and reasoning in the case of Frank v. Wolfe[106] which involved commutation of sentence, a lesser grant but which is an act of grace nevertheless.The Court held in this case that \u201cit is a principle universally recognized that all such grants are to the construed favorably to the grantee, and strictly as to the grantor, not only because they partake of the nature of a deed, and the general rule of interpretation that the terms of a written instrument evidencing with especial force to grants or pardon and commutations, wherein the grantor executes the instrument with little or no right on the part of the grantee to intervene in its execution or dictate its terms, but because of the very nature of the grant itself as an act of grace and clemency. (Bishop Crim. Law, sec. 757, and cases cited: Osborn v. U.S., 91 U.S. 474; Lee v. Murphy, 22 Grat. Va., 789.) Applying the rule we think that, if it had been the intention of the commuting authority to deprive the prisoner of the beneficent provisions of Act No. 1533,[107] language should have been used and would have been used which would leave no room for doubt as to its meaning, and would make clearly manifest the object intended.\u201dThis approach, read with the plain meaning rule of statutory interpretation (i.e., that an instrument should, as a first rule, be read in accordance with the plain meaning that its words import[108]) cannot but lead us to the conclusion that the Risos-Vidal\u2019s \u201cthird Whereas Clause\u201d objection should be thrown out for lack of merit.B.3(b)(ii) The Vox Populi Line of Cases.The second approach is to accept that such doubt cannot be resolved within the four corners of the written pardon and resort should be taken to the external surrounding circumstances that followed the grant and the interests involved (i.e., protection of the interests of the electorate and the recognition of vox populi), as already discussed above and supplemented by the rulings below.In the Fernandez v. House of Representatives Electoral Tribunal[109] line of cases involving the issue of ineligibility based on the residency requirements, that Court declared that it must exercise utmost caution before disqualifying a winning candidate, shown to be the clear choice of the constituents to represent them in Congress.Citing Frivaldo v. COMELEC,[110] the Court held that time and again it has liberally and equitably construed the electoral laws of our country to give fullest effect to the manifest will of our people, for in case of doubt, political laws must be interpreted to give life and spirit to the popular mandate freely expressed through the ballot. Otherwise stated, legal niceties and technicalities cannot stand in the way of the sovereign will.Furthermore, to successfully challenge a winning candidate's qualifications, the petitioner must clearly demonstrate that the ineligibility is so patently antagonistic to constitutional and legal principles that overriding such ineligibility and thereby giving effect to the apparent will of the people, would ultimately create greater prejudice to the very democratic institutions and juristic traditions that our Constitution and laws so zealously protect and promote.Another significant ruling to consider is Malabaguio v. COMELEC et al.[111] involving the appreciation of ballots, the Court, citing its ruling in Alberto v. COMELEC,[112] declared that election cases involve public interest; thus, laws governing election contests must be liberally construed to the end that the will of the people in the choice of public officials may not be defeated by mere technical objections.The Court further reiterated in Maruhom v. COMELEC, et al.[113] its ruling that the question really boils down to a choice of philosophy and perception of how to interpret and apply the laws relating to elections; literal or liberal; the letter or the spirit; the naked provision or the ultimate purpose; legal syllogism or substantial justice; in isolation or in context of social conditions; harshly against or gently in favor of the voter\u2019s obvious choice. In applying election laws, it would be far better to err in favor of popular sovereignty than to be right in complex but little understood legalisms.In Rulloda v. COMELEC, et al.[114] involving substitution of candidates, the Court ruled that the purpose of election laws is to give effect to, rather than frustrate, the will of the voters. It is a solemn duty to uphold the clear and unmistakable mandate of the people. It is well-settled that in case of doubt, political laws must be so construed as to give life and spirit to the popular mandate freely expressed through the ballot.Technicalities and procedural niceties in election cases should not be made to stand in the way of the true will of the electorate. Laws governing election contests must be liberally construed to the end that the will of the people in the choice of public officials may not be defeated by mere technical objections.[115]Election contests involve public interest, and technicalities and procedural barriers must yield if they constitute an obstacle to the determination of the true will of the electorate in the choice of their elective officials. The Court frowns upon any interpretation of the law that would hinder in any way not only the free and intelligent casting of the votes in an election but also the correct ascertainment of the results.[116]These rulings, applicable in a situation of doubt yields the conclusion that the doubt, if any, in the present case should be resolved in Erap\u2019s favor.B.4. Conclusions on Pardon and Grave Abuse of Discretion.In the light of all the above arguments on pardon and the refutation of the positions of the petitioner Risos-Vidal, I submit to the Court that under the Rule 65 standard of review discussed above, no compelling reason exists to conclude that the COMELEC committed grave abuse of discretion in ruling on the pardon aspect of the case.No grave abuse of discretion could have been committed as the COMELEC was correct in its substantive considerations and conclusions. As outlined above, Erap indeed earned the right to vote and to be voted for from the pardon that PGMA granted him. It is the only reasonable and logical conclusion that can be reached under the circumstances of the case.C.The Objections Relating to the 2010 COMELECRulings in the Disqualification Trilogy.As I previously discussed, despite the ponencia\u2019s resolution that the COMELEC did not gravely abuse its discretion in ruling on the issue of Erap\u2019s pardon, another crucial issue to be resolved is whether or not the COMELEC gravely abused its discretion in relying on its 2010 rulings in dismissing the Risos-Vidal petition.This issue must be resolved in the present case as the assailed COMELEC rulings did not rule specifically on the issue of Erap\u2019s pardon but resolved instead that the issue of Erap\u2019s pardon is already a previously \u201csettled matter,\u201d referring to the consolidated COMELEC Rulings in SPA No. 09-028 (DC) and SPA No. 09-104 (DC), entitled Atty. Evilio C. Pormento v. Joseph Ejercito Estrada and In Re: Petition to Disqualify Estrada Ejercito, Joseph M. From Running As President Due to Constitutional Disqualification and Creating Confusion to the Prejudice of Estrada, Mary Lou B.As I will discuss below, the COMELEC did not gravely abuse its discretion in relying on its 2010 disqualification rulings in dismissing Risos-Vidal\u2019s petition.C.1. The Trilogy of Disqualification Cases in 2010.As narrated above,[117] Erap\u2019s 2010 presidential candidacy gave rise to three cases \u2013 the Pamatong, Pormento and Mary Lou Estrada cases - all aimed at disqualifying him. The COMELEC duly ruled in all these cases. If the effects of these rulings have been muddled at all in the understanding of some, the confusion might have been due to the failure to look at the whole 2010 disqualification scene and to see how these trilogy of disqualification cases interacted with one another.The three cases, appropriately given their respective docket numbers, were heard at the same time. While they were essentially based on the same grounds (hence, the description trilogy or a series of three cases that are closely related under a single theme \u2013 the disqualification of Erap), only the Pormento and Mary Lou Estrada cases were formally consolidated; the Pamatong case, the first of the cases, was not included because Pamatong also sought the disqualification from public office of PGMA on the ground that she is also constitutionally barred from being re-elected.Petitioner Pamatong expressly put in issue Erap\u2019s fitness to be a candidate based on his previous conviction for plunder and the terms of the pardon extended him by PGMA; the COMELEC, for its part, directly ruled on the matter. To quote the relevant portions of the COMELEC Resolution in Pamatong:[118]On December 28, 2009, Petitioner Pamatong submitted his Position Paper on Joseph E. Estrada and Gloria M. Arroyo, asking the questions: Are they above the law? The Petitioner Pamatong took the absolutist point of view that former President Joseph Ejercito Estrada is banned forever from seeking the same position of President of the Republic having been previously elected as such President. He also espoused the idea that Respondent Gloria Macapagal Arroyo as the sitting President is forever banned from seeking any other elective office, including a post such as member of the House of Representatives.x x x xFurthermore, Petitioner maintains that the pardon granted Estrada was conditioned on his promise not to run for any public office again. It was not a full pardon but was a conditional one. The exercise of executive clemency was premised on the condition that former President Estrada should not run again for Office of the President of the Philippines or for any other public office.[119]x x x xFurthermore, there is absolutely no indication that the executive clemency exercised by President Gloria Arroyo to pardon Former President Estrada was a mere conditional pardon. It clearly stated that the Former President is \u201crestored to his civil and political rights\u201d and there is nothing in the same which limits the restoration. The only thing stated therein that may have some bearing on the supposed condition is that statement in the whereas clause that contained the following: Whereas, Joseph Estrada has publicly committed to no longer seek any elective position or office, but that is not a condition but is merely part of the preliminary statement. It cannot therefore serve to restrict the operation of or prevail over the explicit statement in the executive clemency which restored all of Estrada\u2019s civil and political rights, including the \u201cright to vote and to be voted for public office\u201d for the position of the Presidency.This executive clemency granted to the former President being absolute and unconditional and having been accepted by him, the same can no longer be revoked.[120] [Emphasis supplied]How the three cases exactly related to one another in terms of the issues posed is described by the COMELEC in its consolidated Resolution in the cases of Pormento and Mary Lou Estrada, as follows:[121]However, as to the substantive aspect of the case, the Respondent\u2019s Answer basically raises and repleads the same defenses which were relied upon in SPA 09-024, except for the additional ground that \u201cthe grant of executive clemency removed all legal impediments that may bar his candidacy for the Presidency.\u201d[122] These grounds consisted of:(a) The \u201cPresident\u201d being alluded to under section 4 of Article VII of the 1987 Constitution refers to the incumbent President;(b) The Prohibition does not apply to the person who merely serves a tenure and not a complete term;(c) Joseph Estrada is not running for reelection but is \u201crunning again\u201d for the same position of President of the Philippines;(d) The Provisions of section 4 (1st par), Article VII of the 1987 Constitution is clear, unequivocal and unambiguous; hence not subject to any interpretation;(e) The evil sought to be prevented is directed against the incumbent President;(f) The sovereignty of the people should be paramount; and(g)The grant of executive clemency removed all legal impediments that may bar his candidacy for the presidency. [Emphasis supplied]As arranged during the COMELEC\u2019s common hearing on the trilogy, separate decisions were rendered simultaneously.[123] They all touched on the issue of pardon.As likewise already explained above, all three cases became final, executory and unappealable five (5) days after its promulgation, pursuant to Section 3, Rule 37 of the COMELEC Rules of Procedure.[124] Since all the petitioners filed their respective motions for reconsideration, finality was reckoned from the denial of these motions.Of the three, petitioner Pormento went one step further to assail the final COMELEC ruling before this Court. His effort did not bear fruitful result as the Court dismissed his petition for mootness \u2013 when the Court issued its ruling, Erap had lost the 2013 presidential elections.In the dismissal of the Pormento petition before this Court [G.R. No. 191188], a nagging issue that has left some uncertainty is the effect of the dismissal on the COMELEC\u2019s Pormento ruling. This assailed COMELEC resolution tackled two issues: 1) the constitutional prohibition on re-election; and 2) the nature of Erap\u2019s pardon and its effect on his qualification to run for an elective public office or as President.The Court, however, in dismissing the case, focused its discussions solely on the issue of the constitutional ban on re-election and ruled that this issue had been rendered moot by the supervening event of Erap\u2019s loss in the 2010 elections; the Court did not discuss or even mention the issue of whether the COMELEC gravely abused its discretion in ruling that Erap\u2019s pardon was absolute and had restored his right to run for the Presidency.In this situation, the assailed COMELEC ruling simply becomes, not only final and executory, but unassailable. No appeal is available as an appeal is barred by the Constitution.[125] No petition for certiorari is likewise available unless another petition had been filed within the period for filing allowed by the Rules of Court.[126] Thus, the COMELEC rulings on the trilogy of disqualification cases fully stand, enforceable according to their terms. From the perspective of the Court, no enforceable ruling was made nor any principle of law established. In other words, the final ruling to be reckoned with in any future dispute is effectively the COMELEC ruling.C.2. The Risos-Vidal Petition and its Objections against Erap\u2019s Status. C.2(a) The Objections and its Fallacies.The Risos-Vidal petition, fully supported by J. Leonen, objects to the binding effect of the 2010 disqualification trilogy decisions, on the claim that res judicata did not apply because pardon was not an issue ruled upon in 2010.This may have partly stemmed from the statement of issues in the 2010 COMELEC Resolution in Pormento defining the issues common to Pormento and Mary Lou Estrada, disregarding the incidents that transpired in the trilogy and the issues that Erap raised in his Answer.[127] Another source of confusion perhaps was the fact that the COMELEC, in ruling on the 2013 Risos-Vidal petition, only cited the Pormento and Mary Lou Estrada cases.The objections, in my view, do not take into account the sequence of events in 2010 on the filing of the disqualification cases, the relationship of the disqualification cases with one another, the law on the finality and binding effect of rulings, and the reason for the COMELEC\u2019s citation of the Pormento and Mary Lou Estrada rulings in the subsequent 2013 Risos-Vidal petition.In Pamatong, Pamatong raised this issue in his Position Paper. Thus, pardon was an issue raised and ruled upon. The same process took place in the subsequent consolidated cases of Pormento and Mary Lou Estrada, so that the COMELEC itself, in its resolution of these cases, recognized that pardon was one of the issues that Erap raised and accordingly ruled on the matter. Significantly, the COMELEC rulings on the matter of pardon in all three cases practically carried the same wording, revealing the COMELEC\u2019s view that the cases constituted a trilogy that posed practically the same issues, one of which is the pardon of Erap.C.2(b) Res Judicata and its Application to the Case.The COMELEC Second Division, in dismissing the Risos-Vidal disqualification petition against Erap, emphasized that the issue of whether Erap\u2019s pardon allowed him to run for office had already been fully discussed in previous cases, and no longer needed re-examination. The COMELEC additionally pointed out that petitioner Risos-Vidal failed to provide sufficient reason to reverse its prior decision.J. Leonen noted that this Court is not barred by res judicata from revisiting the issue of Erap\u2019s pardon; we can review the COMELEC\u2019s decision because there is neither identity of the parties, of subject matters, and of causes of action in the previous disqualification cases. J. Leonen also pointed out that the Court had not ruled with finality on the issue of Erap\u2019s pardon in Pormento, because supervening events had rendered the case moot.I disagree with J. Leonen. As I earlier pointed out, we must review the COMELEC\u2019s decision using the standard of grave abuse of discretion: we nullify the COMELEC ruling if it gravely abused its discretion in ruling on the present case; if no grave abuse of discretion existed, the Risos-Vidal petition should be dismissed instead of being granted.As I will proceed to discuss below, the COMELEC did not gravely abuse its discretion when it ruled in the present case that Erap\u2019s pardon qualified him to run for an elective public office and that this issue is a previously \u201csettled matter.\u201d[128] I say this because the principle of res judicata, under either of its two modes - conclusiveness of judgment or bar by prior judgment- applies in the present case.Res judicata embraces two concepts: first, the bar by prior judgment under Rule 39, Section 47 (b) of the Rules of Court; and second, the preclusion of a settled issue or conclusiveness of judgment under Rule 39, Section 47 (c) of the Rules of Court. The COMELEC\u2019s 2010 decision resolving whether Erap\u2019s pardon allowed him to run for elections precludes further discussion of the very same issue in the 2013 petition filed against his candidacy.Under our review in the present case that is limited to the determination of grave abuse of discretion and not legal error, I cannot agree with J. Leonen\u2019s strict application of the requisites of bar by prior judgment. Jurisprudence has clarified that res judicata does not require absolute identity, but merely substantial identity. This consideration, under a grave abuse standard of review, leads me to the conclusion that we cannot reverse the COMELEC\u2019s decision to apply res judicata, even if it meant the application of the concept of bar by prior judgment.C.2(b)(i) Issue preclusion or res judicata by conclusiveness of judgment.Issue preclusion (or conclusiveness of judgment) prevents the same parties and their privies from re-opening an issue that has already been decided in a prior case. In other words, once a right, fact, or matter in issue has been directly adjudicated or necessarily involved in the determination of an action, it is conclusively settled and cannot again be litigated between the parties and their privies, regardless of whether or not the claim, demand, or subject matter of the two actions are the same.For conclusiveness of judgment to apply, the second case should have identical parties as the first case, which must have been settled by final judgment. It does not, unlike the bar by previous judgment, need identity of subject matter and causes of action.Note at this point, that Rule 37, Section 3 of the COMELEC Rules of Procedure renders the COMELEC\u2019s decision final and executory within five days after its promulgation, unless otherwise restrained by the Court. Neither of the two COMELEC decisions involving Erap\u2019s disqualification in 2010 had been restrained by the Court; suffice it to say that the five-day period after promulgation of the decisions in these cases had long passed.Thus, the COMELEC did not err in considering its decisions in these cases \u2013 all of which resolved the character of Erap\u2019s pardon on the merits \u2013 to be final and executory. That the Court refused to give due course to Pormento\u2019s petition assailing the COMELEC decision on the ground that its issues had been rendered moot by the 2010 elections, did not make the COMELEC\u2019s decision any less final. In fact, Pormento was already final when it reached the Court, subject to the Court\u2019s authority to order its nullification if grave abuse of discretion had intervened.On the requirement of identity of parties, Erap was the defendant in all four cases. While the petitioners in these cases were not the same persons, all of them represented the same interest as citizens of voting age filing their petitions to ensure that Erap, an election candidate, is declared not qualified to run and hold office. Notably, Rule 25, Section 2 of the COMELEC Rules of Procedure[129] requires a prospective petitioner to be a citizen of voting age, or a duly registered political party, to file a petition for disqualification, regardless of the position the candidate sought to be disqualified aspires for.We have had, in several instances, applied res judicata to subsequent cases whose parties were not absolutely identical, but substantially identical in terms of the interests they represent.[130] The cases filed against Erap\u2019s candidacy in the 2010 elections and in the 2013 elections share substantially the common interest of disqualifying Erap as a candidate; these petitioners also all contended that Erap was not qualified to be a candidate because of his previous conviction of plunder.That the 2010 cases involved Erap\u2019s bid for re-election for presidency and the 2013 cases revolved around his mayoralty bid is not, in my view, relevant for purposes of applying collateral estoppel because the identity of the causes of action or the subject matters are not necessary to preclude an issue already litigated and decided on the merits in a prior case. What is crucial for collateral estoppel to apply to the second case is the identity of the issues between the two cases, which had already been decided on the merits in the first case. All the cases seeking to disqualify Erap from running hinged on his previous conviction and on arguments characterizing his subsequent pardon to be merely conditional.The COMELEC had already decided this issue, not once, but twice when it separately but simultaneously decided Pamatong\u2019s petition and the consolidated petitions of Pormento and Estrada. In these cases, it gave the petitioners Pamatong, Pormento and Estrada ample opportunity to present their arguments regarding the nature of Erap\u2019s pardon, to which Erap had also been allowed to reply. After considering their arguments, the COMELEC issued its resolutions that the absolute nature of Erap\u2019s pardon restored both his right to vote and be voted for.C.2(b)(ii) Res judicata through bar by prior judgment.Res judicata, by way of bar by prior judgment, binds the parties to a case, as well as their privies to its judgment, and prevents them from re-litigating the same cause of action in another case. Otherwise put, the judgment or decree of the court of competent jurisdiction on the merits concludes the litigation between the parties, as well as their privies, and constitutes a bar to a new action or suit involving the same cause of action before the same or other tribunal.Res judicata through bar by prior judgment requires (a) that the former judgment be final; (b) that the judgment was rendered by a court of competent jurisdiction; (c) that it is a judgment on the merits; and (d) that, between the first and the second actions, there is identity of parties, subject matters, and causes of action.These requisites were complied with in the present case.C.2(b)(ii)(a) COMELEC as Tribunal of Competent Jurisdiction. That the COMELEC is a tribunal of competent jurisdiction in cancellation of CoC and candidate disqualification cases is mandated by the Constitution no less. Section 2(2), Article IX(C) of the Constitution provides that:Section 2. The Commission on Elections shall exercise the following powers and functions:x x x x2. Exercise exclusive original jurisdiction over all contests relating to the elections, returns, and qualifications of all elective regional, provincial, and city officials, and appellate jurisdiction over all contests involving elective municipal officials decided by trial courts of general jurisdiction, or involving elective barangay officials decided by trial courts of limited jurisdiction. [Emphasis and underscoring supplied]Thus, the competence of the COMELEC to rule on these cases at the first instance needs no further elaboration.C.2(b)(ii)(b) Finality of the 2010 Disqualification Rulings. Some aspects of finality of the disqualification trilogy rulings have been discussed above[131] in terms of when COMELEC judgments become final and the recourses available to assail these judgments. But separately from these questions is the question of the effects of the finality of judgments.Once a judgment attains finality, it becomes immutable and unalterable. It may not be changed, altered or modified in any way even if the modification is for the purpose of correcting an erroneous conclusion of fact or law. This is the \u201cdoctrine of finality of judgments\u201d which binds the immediate parties and their privies in personal judgments; the whole world in judgments in rem; and even the highest court of the land as to their binding effect.[132]This doctrine is grounded on fundamental considerations of public policy and sound practice and that, at the risk of occasional errors, the judgments or orders of courts must become final at some definite time fixed by law; otherwise, there would be no end to litigations, thus setting to naught the main role of courts, which is, to assist in the enforcement of the rule of law and the maintenance of peace and order by settling justiciable controversies with finality.[133]A final judgment vests in the prevailing party a right recognized and protected by law under the due process clause of the Constitution. A final judgment is a vested interest and it is only proper and equitable that the government should recognize and protect this right. Furthermore, an individual cannot be deprived of this right arbitrarily without causing injustice.[134]Just as the losing party has the right to file an appeal within the prescribed period, the winning party also has the correlative right to enjoy the finality of the resolution of his case.[135]In the present case, the COMELEC\u2019s final rulings in the Pamatong, Pormento and Mary Lou Estrada petitions had been made executory through the inclusion of Erap as a candidate not only as a President in the 2010 elections but as Mayor in the 2013 elections.Thus, the COMELEC\u2019s 2010 final ruling in Pamatong and Pormento had been made executory twice not only with respect to the interest of Erap, the winning party, through the inclusion of his name as a candidate, but more importantly, the public, by allowing the electorate to vote for him as a presidential candidate in 2010 and as a mayoralty candidate in 2013.The difference of this case from the usual disqualification cases is that the 2010 unalterable COMELEC ruling on the Erap pardon involved the issue of his political status binding on the whole world and has made his candidacy in the 2013 elections and other future elections valid and immune from another petition for disqualification based on his conviction for plunder. This topic will be discussed at length below.C.2(b)(ii)(c) Judgment on the Merits.A judgment is on the merits when it determines the rights and liabilities of the parties based on the disclosed facts, irrespective of formal, technical or dilatory objections.[136]In Pamatong\u2019s petition to cancel and deny due course to Estrada\u2019s CoC[137] for the position of President in the 2010 elections, the issue of pardon was clearly raised and argued by the parties, resulting in the COMELEC resolution quoted above, specifically ruling that the Erap pardon was absolute and not conditional, entitling him the right to vote and to be voted upon. Not being conditional simply meant that it was not based on Erap\u2019s promise not to run for any public office.[138]In Pormento (which was consolidated with Mary Lou Estrada), the petitioner likewise sought to prevent Estrada from running as President in the 2010 elections. Estrada re-pleaded in his answer the defenses that he raised in Pamatong and added the argument that the grant of executive clemency in his favor removed all legal impediments that may bar his candidacy for the presidency.[139]That pardon was not an issue specified by the COMELEC when it defined the issues common to petitioners Pormento and Mary Lou Estrada is of no moment since COMELEC only outlined the issues that petitioners Pormento and Mary Lou Estrada commonly shared. The matter of pardon was raised as a defense by Estrada and this was duly noted by the COMELEC in its resolution.[140] Under these circumstances, what assumes importance are the terms of the COMELEC resolution itself which expressly discussed and ruled that the Erap pardon was absolute and had the effect of restoring his right to vote and be voted upon.In fact, even if petitioners Pormento and Mary Lou Estrada did not fully argue the pardon issue that Erap raised, it must be appreciated that this issue was indisputably fully argued, ruled upon and became final in Pamatong which was one of the 2010 trilogy of disqualification cases. This finality could not but have an effect on the Pormento and Mary Lou Estrada rulings which carried the same rulings on pardon as Pamatong. The Pormento and Mary Lou Estrada rulings on pardon, which themselves lapsed to finality can, at the very least, be read as a recognition of the final judgment on the pardon in issue in Pamatong, as well as the official final stand of COMELEC on the issue of the Erap pardon.These antecedent proceedings, the parties\u2019 arguments in their respective pleadings, and the COMELEC rulings in Pamatong [SPA 09-24 (DC)] and in Pormento [SPA 09-28] clearly show that the COMELEC rulings in these cases on the issue of pardon were decisions on the merits that can be cited as authorities in future cases.C.2(b)(ii)(d) Identity of Parties, Subject Matter and Cause of Action.Identity of partiesTwo kinds of judgments exist with respect to the parties to the case. The first are the parties in proceedings in personam where the judgments are enforceable only between the parties and their successors in interests, but not against strangers thereto. The second type are the judgments in proceedings where the object of the suit is to bar indifferently all who might be minded to make an objection of any sort against the right sought to be established, and anyone in the world who has a right to be heard on the strength of alleged facts which, if true, show an inconsistent interest; the proceeding is in rem and the judgment is a judgment in rem.[141]This rule is embodied under Section 47, Rule 39 which provides the effect of a judgment or final order rendered by a court of the Philippines, having jurisdiction to pronounce the judgment or final order. In paragraph 47(a), the rules provide that in case of a judgment or final order xxx in respect to the personal, political, or legal condition or status of a particular person or his relationship to another, the judgment or final order is conclusive upon the title to the thing, the will or administration or the condition, status or relationship of the person x x x.[142]In the present case, the 2010 COMELEC final rulings that Erap was qualified to run for public office, after consideration of the issues of presidential re-election and the effect of his pardon for the crime of plunder, constituted a judgment in rem as it was a judgment or final order on the political status of Erap to run for and to hold public office.In other words, a declaration of the disqualification or qualification of a candidate binds the whole world as the final ruling of the COMELEC regarding Erap\u2019s perpetual absolute disqualification and pardon had already become conclusive. The 2010 final rulings of the COMELEC thus bar Risos-Vidal in 2013 from raising the same issue in view of the nature of the 2010 rulings as judgments in rem.I also reiterate my previous discussion that in determining whether res judicata exists, the Court had previously ruled that absolute identity of parties is not required but substantial identity, such that the parties in the first and second cases share the same or a community of interest. As discussed above, this requisite is present in the 2010 disqualification cases and the present Risos-Vidal case.Identity of causes of action and subject mattersI discuss first the element of identity of causes of action because, in the process, the element of identity of subject matters would be likewise covered. On the element of identity of causes of action between the first and second cases, J. Leonen asserts that the 2010 disqualification cases filed by Pormento and Mary Lou Estrada were based on causes of action that were different from those in the present case.According to J. Leonen, the 2010 cases were anchored on the constitutional prohibition against a president\u2019s re-election and the additional ground that Erap was a nuisance candidate. The present case is anchored on Erap\u2019s conviction for plunder which carried with it the accessory penalty of perpetual absolute disqualification. The present case is additionally based on Section 40 of the LGC as well as Section 12 of the OEC. This is clear from the COMELEC\u2019s recital of issues.[143]I disagree with J. Leonen\u2019s positions and short-sighted view of the issues and I maintain that there are identical subject matters and causes of actions, especially for purposes of complying with the requirements of res judicata by way of bar by prior judgment.At this juncture, I reiterate my disagreement with J. Leonen in strictly applying the requisites for the application of res judicata through bar by prior judgment. The Court itself, in numerous cases, did not strictly apply the requirement that there must be absolute identity of causes of action. In fact, the Court\u2019s rulings on this particular element leaned towards substantial identity of causes of action and its determination is arrived at not on the basis of the facial value of the cases but after an in-depth analysis of each case.The reason why substantial identity of causes of action is permitted is to preclude a situation where a party could easily escape the operation of res judicata by changing the form of the action or the relief sought. The difference in form and nature of the two actions is also immaterial and is not a reason to exempt these cases from the effects of res judicata.The philosophy behind this rule prohibits the parties from litigating the same issue more than once. When a right or fact has been judicially tried and determined by a court of competent jurisdiction or an opportunity for such trial has been given, the judgment of the court, as long as it remains unreversed, should be conclusive upon the parties and those in privity with them. In this way, there should be an end to litigation by the same parties and their privies over a subject, once the issue involving the subject is fully and fairly adjudicated.[144]In light of the jurisprudence on res judicata by way of bar by prior judgment, it is my view that the COMELEC did not gravely abuse its discretion in ruling that the issue of Erap\u2019s pardon and its effects on his right to run for elective public office had already been settled in the 2010 disqualification cases.In our jurisdiction, the Court uses various tests in determining whether or not there is identity of causes of action in the first and second cases. One of these tests is the \u201cabsence of inconsistency test\u201d where it is determined whether or not the judgment sought will be inconsistent with the prior judgment. If inconsistency is not shown, the prior judgment shall not constitute a bar to subsequent actions.[145]The second and more common approach in ascertaining identity of causes of action is the \u201csame evidence test,\u201d where the criterion is determined by the question: \u201cwould the same evidence support and establish both the present and former causes of action?\u201d If the answer is in the affirmative, then the prior judgment is a bar to the subsequent action; conversely, it is not.[146]Applying these tests, it is readily apparent that there were identical causes of action in the 2010 disqualification cases against Erap and the present Risos-Vidal case.Using the absence of inconsistency test, the 2010 final COMELEC rulings that Erap was qualified to run for Presidency, an elective public office, would be inconsistent with the ruling being sought in the present case which is, essentially, that Erap\u2019s pardon did not remove his perpetual absolute disqualification to run for elective public office, this time as Mayor of the City of Manila.In short, Erap\u2019s pardon and its effects on his perpetual absolute disqualification brought about by his conviction affect his qualification to run for all elective public offices. Thus the 2010 rulings cannot be limited or linked only to the issue of his qualification to run as President of the Philippines but to any elective public position that he may aspire for in the future.Applying the \u201csame evidence test,\u201d suffice it to say that the Risos-Vidal\u2019s petition rests and falls on Erap\u2019s pardon and its effects on his qualification to run for elective public office. Erap\u2019s pardon is the same evidence necessary for the COMELEC to resolve in the 2010 disqualification cases the issue of whether or not Erap\u2019s pardon removed his disqualification to run for elective public office, thus qualifying him to run for Presidency.It must be recalled that Risos-Vidal relies on Section 40[147] of the LGC and Section 12[148] of the OEC, specifically relating to the disqualification ground of a person\u2019s conviction for a crime involving moral turpitude, in this case, plunder. However, if we are to look closely at these provisions,[149] Erap would not have been disqualified under these provisions because he had already served the 2-year prohibitive period under Section 40 of the LGC.[150] The real main issue of the Risos-Vidal petition is the perpetual absolute disqualification imposed on Erap as an accessory penalty for his conviction for a crime involving moral turpitude; and that his pardon did not remit this disqualification. This issue was obviously directly ruled upon by the COMELEC in the 2010 disqualification cases. Hence, applying the same evidence test, there is identity of causes of action between the 2010 and the Risos-Vidal cases. There was likewise identity of subject matters, specifically the qualification of Erap to run for public office in relation to his pardon.As a side note, I observe that in the 2010 cases, had the COMELEC ruled that Erap had been disqualified to run for elective public office despite his pardon, the issue of the constitutional ban against his re-election would have become moot and academic as Erap would never be qualified in the first place to run for an elective office. Therefore, the ground for Erap\u2019s disqualification based on his perpetual absolute disqualification in relation to his pardon, which were raised by the parties in 2010, were material and necessary for the resolution of the re-election issue. Otherwise, to simply disregard the pardon issue and proceed immediately to the issue on the constitutional ban on re-election is not only absurd but would have been the height of legal ignorance. Fortunately, the COMELEC correctly ruled on the pardon issue directly and did not gravely abuse its discretion in doing so.Since the COMELEC had already decided the issue of Erap\u2019s pardon in the past, it did not act with grave abuse of discretion when it chose not to reverse its prior rulings. Its past decisions, which became final and executory, addressed this issue on the merits. This, and the substantial causes of action, subject matters, and substantial identity of the parties in the 2010 and 2013 cases, sufficiently justified the COMELEC from keeping the discussion of the issue of Erap\u2019s pardon in the 2013 disqualification case.3. Grave Abuse of Discretion, the 2010 Disqualification Trilogy, and COMELEC\u2019s Risos-Vidal Ruling. In light of the above discussions, the COMELEC did not gravely abuse its discretion in its Resolution of April 1, 2013 dismissing the Risos-Vidal petition for lack of merit. In fact, the COMELEC would have gravely abused its discretion had it granted the petition in light of the 2010 trilogy of disqualification cases and the finality of its previous final rulings that the third Whereas Clause of Erap\u2019s pardon did not affect at all the restoration of his civil and political rights, including his right to vote and to be voted upon.Whatever might be said of the trilogy of cases, the reality is that the issue of pardon was brought to the forefront of the argued issues when the parties raised it in all the disqualification cases against Erap and the COMELEC ruled on the issue. That the pardon issue was overshadowed by the presidential re-election issue, not only in the COMELEC, but all the way to this Court, may be an adjudicatory defect, but certainly is not imperfection on the part of Erap for which he should suffer.To be sure, the COMELEC resolution is not a model resolution that is free from imperfections; it cannot serve as a model for legal drafting or for legal reasoning. But whatever these imperfections might be, they could not \u2013 as above explained - have gone beyond errors of law, into grave abuse of discretion. Having been rulings twice-implemented in 2010 and 2013 elections, these past rulings cannot and should not now be repudiated without committing fraud against the electorate who cast their vote and showed their preference for Erap without any notice that their votes ran the risk of being declared stray.For all the above reasons, I vote to dismiss the Risos-Vidal petition for lack of merit.[1] Section 2, Republic Act No. 7080.[2] Resolution of the COMELEC dated January 20, 2010 was attached as Annex 4 to Annex H of the Petitioner\u2019s Memorandum.[3] See page 8 of the COMELEC, Second Division Resolution dated January 20, 2010 in SPA No. 09-024(DC) entitled Rev.

At page 22 of the COMELEC Resolution dated January 20, 2010 in the Pamatong petition [SPA No. 09-024 (DC)], the COMELEC Second Division ruled that:\u201cFurthermore, there is absolutely no indication that the executive clemency exercised by President Arroyo to pardon Former President Estrada was a mere conditional pardon. It clearly stated that the former president is \u201crestored to his civil and political rights\u201d and there is nothing in the same which limits the restoration. The only thing stated therein that may have some bearing on the supposed conditions is that statement in the whereas clause that contained the following: Whereas, Joseph Ejercito Estrada has publicly committed to no longer seek any elective position or office, but that is not a condition but is merely part of a preliminary statement. It cannot therefore serve to restrict the operation of or prevail over the explicit statement in the executive clemency which restored all of Estrada\u2019s civil and political rights, including the \u201cright to vote and to be voted for a public office,\u201d including the position of the Presidency.This executive clemency granted to the former President being absolute and unconditional and having been accepted by him, the same can no longer be revoked.\u201dB. At pages 23-24 of the of the COMELEC Resolution dated January 20, 2010 in the Pormento and Mary Lou petitions [SPA Nos. 09-028 (DC) and 09-104 (DC)], the COMELEC Second Division ruled that:\u201cFurthermore, there is absolutely no indication that the executive clemency exercised by President Arroyo to pardon Former President Estrada was a mere conditional pardon. It clearly stated that the former president is \u201crestored to his civil and political rights\u201d and there is nothing in the same which limits the restoration.

There is nothing stated in the dispositive part that it was conditioned upon said respondent\u2019s purported public commitment. His public statement cannot, therefore, restrict the operation of, or prevail over, the explicit statement in the executive clemency which restored all of Estrada\u2019s civil and political rights, including the \u201cright to vote and to be voted for a public office,\u201d including to the position of the Presidency.

Bernas: The decision I cited was precisely an interpretation of the clause in the provisions on the COMELEC which says: \u201cAny decision, order, or ruling of the Commission may be brought to the Supreme Court on certiorari\u2026\u201d In interpreting that provision in the case of Aratuc, the Supreme Court said:We hold therefore that under the existing constitutional and statutory provisions, the certiorari jurisdiction of the Court over orders, rulings and decision of the COMELEC is not as broad as it used to be and should be confined to instances of grave abuse of discretion amounting to patent and substantial denial of due process. Does that express the sense of the Committee?Mr. Regalado. That was the view of Justice Barredo in the Aratuc case while he was the ponente xxx In subsequent decisions wherein Chief Justice Teehankee concurred, he believed that the mode of review on certiorari under Rule XLV [should be LXV] is to be understood as including acts of the Constitutional Commissions, without jurisdiction or acting in excess of jurisdiction.Fr. Bernas. This seems to be the same thing. If it is without jurisdiction or in excess of jurisdiction, there is grave abuse of discretion.Mr. Regalado. No, Commissioner. Grave abuse of discretion may be equivalent to lack of jurisdiction, if it was done in a capricious or whimsical manner. But excess of jurisdiction is a little different, meaning, that the Supreme Court had jurisdiction but it overstepped the bounds of jurisdiction in the exercise thereof. That is what Justice Teehankee also pointed out. Grave abuse of discretion, I agree, results in lack of jurisdiction, but excess of jurisdiction presupposes that the Court, while with jurisdiction just overstepped the permissible bounds in the exercise thereof.Fr. Bernas: So, for purposes of the record now, what is the intention of the Committee? What are the grounds for certiorari?Mr. Regalado. The Committee which refers specifically to technical term of review by certiorari would be relying on the provisions of Rule XLV [Should be LXV] of the Rules of Court that laid down the three grounds.

[Source: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Covenant_on_Civil_and_Political_Rights][71] The Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) is a declaration adopted by the United Nations General Assembly on 10 December 1948 at the Palais de Chaillot, Paris. The Declaration arose directly from the experience of the Second World War and represents the first global expression of rights to which all human beings are inherently entitled. The Declaration consists of thirty articles which have been elaborated in subsequent international treaties, regional human rights instruments, national constitutions, and other laws. The International Bill of Human Rights consists of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and its two Optional Protocols. In 1966, the General Assembly adopted the two detailed Covenants, which complete the International Bill of Human Rights. In 1976, after the Covenants had been ratified by a sufficient number of individual nations, the Bill took on the force of international law.The Declaration was commissioned in 1946 and was drafted over two years by the Commission on Human Rights. The Philippine representative was part of the Commission; the Philippines voted in favor of this Declaration. (Source: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Declaration_of_Human_Rights)[72] G.R.

Such term may also refer, in its general sense, to rights capable of being enforced or redressed in a civil action. Also quite often mentioned are the guarantees against involuntary servitude, religious persecution, unreasonable searches and seizures, and imprisonment for debt.Political rights refer to the right to participate, directly or indirectly, in the establishment or administration of government, the right of suffrage, the right to hold public office, the right of petition and, in general, the rights appurtenant to citizenship vis-a-vis the management of government.[76] See Articles 40 to 45 of the Revised Penal Code on penalties in which accessory penalties are inherent.[77] Article 41, Revised Penal Code.[78] Pardon; its effect. - A pardon shall not work the restoration of the right to hold public office, or the right of suffrage, unless such rights be expressly restored by the terms of the pardon.A pardon shall in no case exempt the culprit from the payment of the civil indemnity imposed upon him by the sentence.[79] Reclusion perpetua and reclusion temporal; Their accessory penalties. - The penalties of reclusion perpetua and reclusion temporal shall carry with them that of civil interdiction for life or during the period of the sentence as the case may be, and that of perpetual absolute disqualification which the offender shall suffer even though pardoned as to the principal penalty, unless the same shall have been expressly remitted in the pardon.[80] The Revised Penal Code, Act No. 3815 was passed on December 8, 1930 and become effective on January 1, 1932.

However, subsequent to this, the applications for amnesty of accused-appellants were granted by the National Amnesty Commission on February 22, 1996. Issue: Whether or not Casido and Alcorin may now be released on the basis of the amnesty granted to them.[97] Accused-appellant Jose Patriarca is a member of the New People\u2019s Army. He was convicted of murder for killing persons in pursuit of his group\u2019s political belief.

Issue: Whether or not Patriarca is entitled to amnesty.[98] Petitioners Norberto Jimenez and Loreto Barrioquinto were charged with the crime of murder. Subsequently, Proclamation No. 8, dated September 7, 1946, which grants amnesty in favor of all persons who may be charged with an act penalized under the Revised Penal Code in furtherance of the resistance to the Japanese forces or against persons aiding in the war efforts of the enemy.After a preliminary hearing had started, the Amnesty Commission issued an order returning the cases of the petitioners to the Court of First Instance of Zamboanga, without deciding whether or not they are entitled to the benefits of he said Amnesty Proclamation, on the ground that inasmuch as neither Barrioquinto nor Jimenez have admitted having committed the offense, because Barrioquinto alleged that it was Hipolito Tolentino who shot and/ killed the victim, they cannot invoke the benefits of amnesty.

The matter, however, is engrossed in a deeper constitutional conundrum that affects the exercise of one of the most benevolent powers of the President\u2014the power to extend executive clemency in the form of pardon. Undoubtedly, the Court\u2019s ruling on this case would shape the parameters surrounding the future exercise of the said power, thus, requiring a pragmatic stance that would equal the theoretical and practical purpose of the pardoning power, that is, the realization of checks and balances in government and the relief given to the pardonee.The undisputed facts as culled from the records:In its September 12, 2007 Decision, the Sandiganbayan convicted respondent former President Joseph Ejercito Estrada (Estrada) of plunder. The fallo of the decision reads:WHEREFORE, in view of all the foregoing, judgment is hereby rendered in Criminal Case No. 26558 finding the accused, Former President Joseph Ejercito Estrada, GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of PLUNDER, defined in and penalized by Republic Act No. 7080, as amended. On the other hand, for failure of the prosecution to prove and establish their guilt beyond reasonable doubt, the Court finds the accused Jose \u201cJinggoy\u201d Estrada and Atty. Edward S. Serapio NOT GUILTY of the crime of plunder and, accordingly, the Court hereby orders their ACQUITTAL.The penalty imposable for the crime of plunder under Republic Act No. 7080, as amended by Republic Act No. 7659, is Reclusion Perpetua to Death. There being no aggravating or mitigating circumstances, however, the lesser penalty shall be applied in accordance with Article 63 of the Revised Penal Code. Accordingly, the accused Former President Joseph Ejercito Estrada is hereby sentenced to suffer the penalty of Reclusion Perpetua and the accessory penalties of civil interdiction during the period of sentence and perpetual absolute disqualification.The period within which accused Former President Joseph Ejercito Estrada has been under detention shall be credited to him in full as long as he agrees voluntarily in writing to abide by the same disciplinary rules imposed upon convicted prisoners.Moreover, in accordance with Section 2 of Republic Act No. 7080, as amended by Republic Act No. 7659, the Court hereby declares the forfeiture in favor of the government of the following:(1) The total amount of Five Hundred Forty Two Million Seven Hundred Ninety One Thousand Pesos (P545,291,000.00), with interest and income earned, inclusive of the amount of Two Hundred Million Pesos (P200,000,000.00), deposited in the name and account of the Erap Muslim Youth Foundation.(2) The amount of One Hundred Eighty Nine Million Pesos (P189,000,000.00), inclusive of interests and income earned, deposited in the Jose Velarde account.(3) The real property consisting of a house and lot dubbed as Boracay Mansion located at #100 11th Street, New Manila, Quezon City.The cash bonds posted by accused Jose Jinggoy Estrada and Atty. Edward S. Serapio are hereby ordered cancelled and released to the said accused or their duly authorized representatives upon presentation of the original receipt evidencing payment thereof and subject to the usual accounting and auditing procedures. Likewise, the hold-departure orders issued against the said accused are hereby recalled and declared functus oficio.SO ORDERED.On October 25, 2007, then President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo (PGMA) granted executive clemency to Estrada. The text of the said pardon is hereunder replicated:MALACANAN PALACEMANILA_________________________________________________By the President of the PhilippinesPARDON_________________________________________________Whereas, this Administration has a policy of releasing inmates who have reached the age of seventy (70),Whereas, Joseph Ejercito Estrada has been under detention for six and a half years,Whereas, Joseph Ejercito Estrada has publicly committed to no longer seek any elective position or office,In view hereof and pursuant to the authority conferred upon me by the Constitution, I hereby grant executive clemency to Joseph Ejercito Estrada, convicted by the Sandiganbayan of plunder and imposed a penalty of reclusion perpetua. He is hereby restored to his civil and political rights.The forfeitures imposed by the Sandiganbayan remain in force and in full, including all writs and processes issued by the Sandiganbayan in pursuance hereof, except for the bank account(s) he owned before his tenure as President.Upon acceptance of this pardon by JOSEPH EJERCITO ESTRADA, this pardon shall take effect.Given under my hand at the City of Manila, this 25th day of October, in the year of Our Lord, two thousand and seven.Gloria M. Arroyo (sgd.)By the President:IGNACIO R. BUNYE (sgd.)Acting Executive Secretary [Emphasis supplied]The next day, Estrada accepted the pardon as evidenced by a handwritten notation in the same document.Subsequently, Estrada undertook his second bid for the presidency during the 2010 elections. This candidacy hurdled two (2) disqualification cases filed by Atty. Evilio C. Pormento and Mary Lou B. Estrada (2010 disqualification cases), when these were denied for lack of merit by the Commission on Elections (COMELEC), Second Division, and the COMELEC En Banc in its respective resolutions, dated January 20, 2010[1] and April 27, 2010.[2] The COMELEC was of the position that Estrada was eligible to run for president on the ground that the constitutional prohibition on re-election[3] applies to an incumbent president.Upon elevation to the Court, however, the opportunity to resolve the said constitutional issue was arrested by mootness, with Estrada having lost the elections to President Benigno Aquino.[4]Undaunted by his defeat in the race for national office, Estrada thereafter sought the position of mayor in no less than the City of Manila. He filed his certificate of candidacy on October 2, 2012.Petitioner Atty. Alicia Risos-Vidal (petitioner) invoked Estrada\u2019s disqualification from running for public office, this time on the ground that his candidacy was a violation of the pardon extended by PGMA. She filed a petition for disqualification with the COMELEC[5] pursuant to Section 12 of Batas Pambansa Blg. 881 (Omnibus Election Code),[6] grounded on a sole argument, viz:RESPONDENT IS DISQUALIFIED TO RUN FOR PUBLIC OFFICE BECUSE OF HIS CONVICTION FOR PLUNDER BY THE SANDIGANBAYAN IN CRIMINAL CASE NO. 26558 ENTITLED \u201cPEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES VS. JOSEPH EJERCITO ESTRADA\u201d SENTENCING HIM TO SUFFER THE PENALTY OF RECLUSION PERPETUA WITH PERPETUAL ABSOLUTE DISQUALIFICATION.In the main, the petitioner argued that Estrada was still suffering from the accessory penalties of civil interdiction and perpetual disqualification because the pardon granted to him failed to expressly restore his right to suffrage and to run for public office as provided under Articles 36 and 41 of the Revised Penal Code. Furthermore, the \u201cwhereas clause\u201d in the pardon which stated that, \u201cJoseph Ejercito Estrada has publicly committed to no longer seek any elective position or office\u201d would indicate a condition that Estrada must abide by under pain of recommitment to prison in the event of violation thereof. The petitioner likewise finds support in the concurring opinion of Justice Padilla in Monsanto v. Factoran,[7] stated in this wise:An examination of the presidential pardon in question shows that, while petitioner was granted \"an absolute and unconditional pardon and restored to full civil and political rights\", yet, nothing therein expressly provides that the right to hold public office was thereby restored to the petitioner. In view of the express exclusion by Art. 36, RPC of the right to hold public office, notwithstanding a pardon unless the right is expressly restored by the pardon, it is my considered opinion that, to the extent that the pardon granted to the petitioner did not expressly restore the right to hold public office as an effect of such pardon, that right must be kept away from the petitioner.After an exchange of pleadings, the COMELEC Second Division issued its April 1, 2013 Resolution dismissing the petition for lack of merit.[8] The dismissal was grounded on its resolution of the 2010 disqualification cases where it found that the pardon granted to Estrada was absolute and unconditional, hence, entitling him to run for public office. The dismissal was affirmed over petitioner\u2019s motion for reconsideration in the April 23, 2013 Resolution of the COMELEC En Banc.[9]Impervious to her cause, the petitioner comes to this Court, ascribing grave abuse of discretion on the part of the COMELEC in declining to disqualify Estrada motu propio, based on the following grounds cited by it: 1] the issues raised in the petition have already been passed upon in the past; 2] Estrada\u2019s pardon was not conditional; 3] Estrada is not disqualified to run as mayor despite Section 40 of the Local Government Code (LGC); and 4] Estrada\u2019s pardon restored his right to suffrage and remitted his perpetual disqualification from seeking public office.During the pendency of the petition, local elections were conducted on May 13, 2013, yielding a victory for Estrada over his opponents including then incumbent Mayor Alfredo S. Lim (Lim). Consequently, the latter moved to intervene in the petition, which was granted by the Court in its June 25, 2013 Resolution.[10] Lim supports petitioner\u2019s theory that Estrada remains to be disqualified to hold public office as his pardon did not expressly remit his perpetual disqualification, and, pursuant to the Court\u2019s ruling in Jalosjos v. COMELEC,[11] he must be declared as the rightful mayor of the City of Manila.After an exchange of pleadings,[12] the parties were required to submit their respective memoranda. The parties complied on different dates.[13]To my mind, the following queries and premises, which are crafted in a clear-cut and logical sequence, serve as guideposts for the Court in order to arrive at conclusions that are consonant with prevailing law and jurisprudence:Was the executive pardon extended to Estrada conditional or absolute?What were the effects of the pardon, particularly the statement, \u201c[h]e is hereby restored to his civil and political rights\u201d? Does this include the restoration of his right to suffrage and to run for public office?Given that the nature of pardon, whether absolute or conditional, does not imply the automatic obliteration of the pardonee\u2019s guilt, is Estrada qualified to run for and hold a mayoralty position?I. Estrada\u2019s Pardon Was AbsoluteAfter admittedly having failed to argue on this before the COMELEC, the petitioner expressly elevated this issue for the resolution of the Court. Her insistence on the conditional nature of Estrada\u2019s pardon is anchored on the latter\u2019s expressed acceptance of the same. In her words, this acceptance became \u201cthe fundamental basis and indicium of the conditional nature of the pardon.\u201d[14] She contends that had PGMA intended to issue an absolute pardon, she would have not required Estrada\u2019s acceptance thereof. Having accepted its terms with a commitment of strict compliance, Estrada should be deemed to have breached the \u201ccontract\u201d when he ran for Mayor.Amidst this argument, the primordial question continues to nag: was the pardon bestowed on Estrada conditional or absolute? For the following reasons, I find that Estrada\u2019s pardon was absolute in nature:First. I am of the view that the acceptance confers effectivity in both absolute and conditional pardon.Pardon is defined as \u201can act of grace, proceeding from the power entrusted with the execution of the laws, which exempts the individual, on whom it is bestowed, from the punishment the law inflicts for a crime he has committed. It is the private, though official act of the executive magistrate, delivered to the individual for whose benefit it is intended, and not communicated officially to the Court. ... A pardon is a deed, to the validity of which delivery is essential, and delivery is not complete without acceptance.\u201d[15]The fact of Estrada\u2019s acceptance of the pardon, by affixing his signature therein, is an insufficient indication of its conditional nature. Petitioner\u2019s reliance on Cabantag v. Wolf,[16] where the Court ruled that a conditional pardon has no force until accepted by the condemned because the condition may be less acceptable to him than the original punishment and may in fact be more onerous, is misplaced. It merely stated that a conditional pardon must be accepted in the exercise of the pardonee\u2019s right to choose whether to accept or reject the terms of the pardon. It does not operate in the manner suggested by petitioner. It does not work the other way around.An \u201cacceptance\u201d does not classify a pardon as conditional just by the mere reception and the placing of an inscription thereon. I am not prepared to ignore the very intention and content of a pardon as standards to determine its nature, as against the mere expediency of its delivery and acceptance. I am much more amenable to the rule consistent with the benevolent nature of pardon: that it is an act of forgiveness predicated on an admission of guilt. To be effective, therefore, this admission of past wrongdoing must be manifested by the acceptance of a pardon, absolute or conditional.Further, the significance of \u201cacceptance\u201d is more apparent in cases of \u201ccommutation,\u201d which is the substitution of a lighter punishment for a heavier one. William F. Duker elucidates:Although for a pardon to be effective it usually must be accepted, commutation is effective without acceptance. In Chapman v. Scott, the President granted a commutation to \u201ctime-served\u201d to a convict so that he would be available for prosecution in a state court on a capital case. The convict refused the commutation and argued that it was not effective until accepted, but the court held that a commutation did not require acceptance:Although power to commute is logically derivable from power to pardon, commutation is essentially different from pardon. Pardon exempts from punishment, bears no relation to term of punishment, and must be accepted, or it is nugatory. Commutation merely substitutes lighter for heavier punishment. It removes no stain, restores no civil privileges, and may be effected without the consent and against the will of the prisoner.[17]As applied to Estrada\u2019s case, his acceptance of the pardon does not necessarily negate its absolute nature. The more appropriate test to apply in the determination of the subject pardon\u2019s character is the grantor\u2019s intention as revealed in the four corners of the document.Second. The controversial perambulatory clause which states, \u201cWhereas, Joseph Ejercito Estrada has publicly committed to no longer seek any elective position or office,\u201d should not be considered as a restriction on Estrada\u2019s pardon.Primarily, rules on statutory construction provide that whereas clauses, do not form part of a statute, strictly speaking; they are not part of the operative language of the statute.[18] While they may be helpful to the extent that they articulate the general purpose or reason underlying a new enactment, reliance on whereas clauses as aids in construing statutes is not justified when their interpretation \u201ccontrol the specific terms of the statute.\u201d[19]As applied in Estrada\u2019s case, the subject whereas clause does not purport to control or modify the unequivocal terms found in the pardon\u2019s body. In this sense, the \u201cwhereas clauses\u201d in Estrada\u2019s pardon cannot adversely affect the ultimate command which it evokes, that is, executive clemency is granted to Estrada absent any condition.A conditional pardon basically imposes a condition. I take this to mean that it must either stipulate a circumstance, a situation, or a requisite that must come into pass or express a restriction that must not ensue. I find none in this case. The plain language of the pardon extended to Estrada does not set forth any of these. It was couched in a straightforward conferment of pardon, to wit:I hereby grant executive clemency to Joseph Ejercito Estrada, convicted by the Sandiganbayan of plunder and imposed a penalty of reclusion perpetua.Had PGMA intended to impress a condition on Estrada, the same would have been clearly stated as a requirement of, or restriction to, the above conferment. I am inclined to posit that the extension of a conditional pardon to her political rival is a matter that PGMA would have regarded with solemnity and tact. After all, the pardoning power is a pervasive means to bluntly overrule the force and effect, not only of a court\u2019s judgment of conviction, but the punitive aspect of criminal laws. As it turned out, no direct showing suggests that the pardon was conditional.For a condition to be operative, the condition must appear on the face of the document. The conditions must be clear and specific. The reason is that the conditions attached to a pardon should be definite and specific as to inform the person pardoned of what would be required.[20] As no condition was patently evinced in the document, the Court is at no liberty to shape one, only because the plain meaning of the pardon\u2019s text is unacceptable for some waylaid and extraneous reasons. That the executive clemency given to Estrada was unaccompanied by any condition is clearly visible in the text of the pardon. The Court must simply read the pardon as it is written. There is no necessity to resort to construction. I choose to heed the warning enunciated in Yangco v. Court of First Instance of Manila:. . . [w]here language is plain, subtle refinements which tinge words so as to give them the color of a particular judicial theory are not only unnecessary but decidedly harmful. That which has caused so much confusion in the law, which has made it so difficult for the public to understand and know what the law is with respect to a given matter, is in considerable measure the unwarranted interference by judicial tribunals with the English language as found in statutes and contracts, cutting the words here and inserting them there, making them fit personal ideas of what the legislature ought to have done or what parties should have agreed upon, giving them meanings which they do not ordinarily have cutting, trimming, fitting, changing and coloring until lawyers themselves are unable to advise their clients as to the meaning of a given statute or contract until it has been submitted to some court for its interpretation and construction.[21]Suffice it to say, a statement describing Estrada\u2019s previous commitment not to seek any elective office cannot operate as a condition for his pardon, sans any indication that it was intended to be so. In light of the clear absence of any condition in the pardon, no ambiguity warrants interpretation by the Court. At the most, the subject whereas clause depicts the state of affairs at the time when the pardon was granted. It should not be considered as part and parcel of the entire act as it serves neither the ability to enlarge or confer powers nor the authority to control the words of the act.Third. The pardoning power is granted exclusively to the President amidst the constitutional scheme of checks and balances. While it is most ideal that the executive strictly adheres to this end, it is undeniable that the pardoning power is still dependent on the grantor\u2019s measure of wisdom and sense of public policy. This reality invites, if not bolsters, the application of the political question doctrine. The only weapon, which the Court has freedom to wield, is the exercise of judicial power against a blatant violation of the Constitution. When unavailing, the Court is constrained to curb its own rebuking power and to uphold the acumen of a co-equal branch. It would do the Court well to remember that neither the Congress nor the courts can question the motives of the President in the use of the power.[22]Hence, in determining the nature of Estrada\u2019s pardon, the Court must undertake a tempered disposition and avoid a strained analysis of the obvious. Where there is no ostensible condition stated in the body of the pardon, to envisage one by way of statutory construction is an inexcusable judicial encroachment.The absolute nature of Estrada\u2019s pardon now begets a more astute query: what rights were restored in his favor?II. Estrada\u2019s Civil and Political Rights RestoredIn this particular issue, the ponencia deserves my full agreement in finding that the third preambular clause of Estrada\u2019s pardon does not militate against the conclusion that Estrada\u2019s rights to suffrage and to seek public office have been restored. Further, the subject pardon had substantially complied with the statutory requirements laid down in Articles 36 and 41 of the RPC. The authority of the said provisions of law was reinforced by the ruling of the Court in Monsanto v. Factoran. A deeper analysis of Monsanto, however, reveals that its repercussions actually favor Estrada.Consider these points:Monsanto involved an absolute pardon, from which, Estrada likewise benefits.The issue in Monsanto involved the propriety of an automatic reinstatement to public office. In refutation of the Garland cases, the Court maintained that while an absolute pardon remits all the penal consequences of a criminal indictment if only to give meaning to the fiat that a pardon, being a presidential prerogative ... it, however, rejected the \u201cfictitious belief that pardon blots out the guilt of an individual and that once he is absolved, he should be treated as if he were innocent.\u201dMonsanto\u2019s absolute disqualification or ineligibility from public office was considered to have formed part of the punishment prescribed against her. Ultimately, when her guilt and punishment were expunged by her pardon, this particular disability was likewise removed.Noteworthy is the observation of the Court that she may apply for reappointment to the office, but in the appraisal of her suitability to a public post, the facts constituting her past offense should be taken into account to determine whether she could once again serve in a public office.After serious reflection, I am convinced that the foregoing pronouncement parallels that which should apply to Estrada.In Monsanto, the Court declared that the absolute pardon granted to her by the President effectively expunged her disqualification or ineligibility to hold public office because this formed part of the penalty against her. As in the foregoing discussion on the absolute nature of Estrada\u2019s pardon, there is no question that his pardon likewise remitted the punishment previously imposed in his conviction for plunder. As such, he was released from incarceration and thereafter regained his liberty of movement, albeit ordered to abide by the forfeiture of his properties as listed in the judgment of the Sandiganbayan. More significantly, there was no categorical statement impressed in Monsanto that banned her from holding public office again. All that it withheld was an automatic reinstatement to her previous office and her entitlement to backpay. In other words, Monsanto may hold public office provided that there is favorable action on her application.While I generally acquiesce with the scholarly opinions of Justices Padilla and Feliciano in Monsanto, I find it difficult to apply their respective observations (that based on Article 36 of the RPC, it was clear that the pardon extended by the President did not per se entitle Monsanto to again hold public office or to suffrage because nothing therein expressly provided the restoration of the said rights with specifity) precisely because this was not adopted in the majority decision. There is a stark difference between the positions taken by the concurring justices from the very holding of the majority. The former entirely and perpetually denied Monsanto of her right to hold public office, while the latter merely disallowed an automatic reinstatement but permitted her to undergo re-application with the only caveat that her pardon did not place her in a state of complete innocence. In other words, her past conviction should be considered as forming part of her credentials in her re-application for public office. Between these two conclusions, I choose with steadfast belief that the holding pronounced in the majority decision should prevail. The strict interpretation of Article 36 as advocated in the concurring opinion was not adopted in the main decision, hence, rendering the same as mere obiter dictum which has no controlling effect.While I do not subscribe to Estrada\u2019s theory that Articles 36 and 41 of the RPC have the effect of abridging and diminishing the power of the President, I also remain unconvinced that the said provisions of law should apply to his case because the strict interpretation of these provisions were not encapsulated in jurisprudence, particularly Monsanto. Therefore, the statement, \u201cHe is hereby restored to his civil and political rights,\u201d as found in the subject pardon does not fall short of producing the effect of wiping away the penalties being suffered by the pardonee. As things stand now, an absolute and full pardon erases both the principal and accessory penalties meted against him, thereby allowing him to hold public office once again.Corollary to this, I am of the opinion that PGMA\u2019s failure to use the term \u201cfull,\u201d apropos to the restoration of Estrada\u2019s rights does not denigrate its coverage. PGMA\u2019s omission to use such term in the case of Estrada may have been caused by reasons unknown to the Court. The Court cannot discount the possibility that this was borne out of plain inadvertence, considering the fact that the pardon was unaccompanied by a clear condition. Had it been PGMA\u2019s intention to restrict the rights restored to Estrada, she could have stated clear exceptions thereto, instead of employing a phrase, which, in its plain meaning, comprises the right to vote and to run for public office. Besides, the deprivation of these rights is a dangerous ground that the Court should not tread on, especially when the intention to restrict their exercise is impalpable.Applying this to the case at bench, no ban from holding public office should be imposed on Estrada, because the absolute pardon given to him had effectively extinguished both the principal and accessory penalties brought forth by his conviction. Succinctly, Estrada\u2019s civil and political rights had been restored in full.III. Estrada\u2019s Right to Run for Public Office Restored Consistent with my view that Monsanto reflects the obliteration of Estrada\u2019s perpetual disqualification, I conclude that he now possesses the right to vote and to run for public office.Lest it be misunderstood, this conclusion does not degenerate from the doctrine that a pardon only relieves a party from the punitive consequences of his past crimes, nothing more. Indeed, \u201ca person adjudged guilty of an offense is a convicted criminal, though pardoned; he may be deserving of punishment, though left unpunished; and the law may regard him as more dangerous to society than one never found guilty of crime, though it places no restraints upon him following his conviction.\u201d[23] Estrada was not reborn into innocence by virtue of the forgiveness bestowed in by the pardon. The moral stain caused by his past crimes remains to be part of his person, then as now. In no way did his pardon serve as a stamp of incorruptibility. It is not a magic spell that superimposes virtuousness over guilt. His past conviction for plunder would forever form part of his person, whether as a private individual or a public officer.Without squabble, plunder is a crime involving moral turpitude. Nevertheless, this fact alone negates a mechanical application of statutory provisions on disqualification. One thing is clear, in the exercise of her exclusive power to grant executive clemency, PGMA pardoned Estrada, thereby wiping away the penalties of his crime and entitling him the right to run for public office. Corollary to this, Estrada\u2019s fitness to hold public office is an issue that should not concern the Court. All that the Court can rule on is the availability of Estrada\u2019s right to seek public office. This ruling on his eligibility is not tantamount to a declaration that Estrada befits a person wholly deserving of the people\u2019s trust. The Manile\u00f1os\u2019 decision alone can mould the city\u2019s journey to either development or decline. Indeed, election expresses the sovereign will of the people consistent with the principle of vox populi est suprema lex. This is the beauty of democracy which the Court must endeavour to protect at all cost. As Abraham Lincoln put it with both guile and eloquence,Elections belong to the people. It's their decision. If they decide to turn their back on the fire and burn their behinds, then they will just have to sit on their blisters.For the foregoing reasons, I vote to CONCUR with the majority opinion.[1] Rollo. pp. 1009-1034.[2] Id. at 1035-1054.[3] Section 4, Article VII 1987 Constitution.[4] Atty.

By reading an ambiguity in favor of a convicted public officer, impunity is tolerated.I dissent.Joseph Ejercito Estrada, former President of the Republic of the Philippines, was found guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of plunder. A heinous crime of the highest order, the law penalizing plunder \u2014 Republic Act No. 7080 \u2014 made possible the imposition of the supreme penalty of death upon public officers who amass ill-gotten wealth on a grand scale through a combination or series of acts.[1] Though an intervening statute[2] now prevents the imposition of the penalty of death, our laws have no less abhorrence for this crime.Joseph Ejercito Estrada, former President of the Republic of the Philippines, was pardoned shortly after he had been convicted. This case presents to this court a dilemma engendered by ambiguities in the pardon extended to him.The court must decide on whether these ambiguities shall be interpreted to benefit a convicted former President, shown to have amassed ill-gotten wealth on a grand scale and to have betrayed the trust given to him through the investiture of the highest office in the land; or to benefit the public which reposes its trust on elected public officials. Many other public officials have been found liable for graft and corrupt practices of far lesser scales than those for which Joseph Ejercito Estrada had been convicted. They now languish in jails, deprived of liberties and entitlements. This case is not about their pardon. They continue to suffer the penalties that their convictions entail, unlike the former President of the Republic of the Philippines.This case, in short, will affect the public\u2019s attitude to the Rule of Law and the possibilities for immunity for very influential public officials.Not having been unequivocally restored to a status worthy of being a repository of the public trust, there is no reason to lavish Joseph Ejercito Estrada by facilitating his reversion to elective public office. Thus, I dissent from the majority decision.IThrough a petition for certiorari, Atty. Alicia Risos-Vidal (Risos-Vidal) prays that the assailed resolutions[3] dated April 1, 2013 of the Second Division of public respondent Commission on Elections (COMELEC), and April 23, 2013 of COMELEC, sitting En Banc, be annulled and set aside. In addition, she prays that a new judgment be entered disqualifying private respondent Joseph Ejercito Estrada (Estrada) from running as Mayor of the City of Manila, and cancelling the certificate of candidacy he filed in connection with the May 13, 2013 election for the position of Mayor of the City of Manila.[4]The assailed April 1, 2013 resolution dismissed the petition for disqualification filed by Risos-Vidal and docketed as SPA No. 13-211 (DC). The assailed April 23, 2013 resolution denied her motion for reconsideration.A motion for leave to intervene[5] was filed by Estrada\u2019s opponent in the mayoralty race, Alfredo S. Lim (Lim). Attached to Lim\u2019s motion was his petition-in-intervention.[6] Lim\u2019s motion was granted by the court in the resolution[7] dated June 25, 2013.IIStatement of the antecedentsOn April 4, 2001, the Office of the Ombudsman filed against private respondent, Joseph Ejercito Estrada, former President of the Republic of the Philippines, and several other accused,[8] an information for plunder, penalized by Republic Act No. 7080, as amended by Republic Act No. 7659. This case was filed before the Sandiganbayan and docketed as Criminal Case No. 26558.In the decision[9] dated September 12, 2007, the Sandiganbayan, Special Division, convicted Estrada of the crime of plunder. He was sentenced to suffer \u201cthe penalty of Reclusion Perpetua and the accessory penalties of civil interdiction during the period of sentence and perpetual absolute disqualification.\u201d[10]The dispositive portion of this decision reads:WHEREFORE, in view of all the foregoing, judgment is hereby rendered in Criminal Case No. 26558 finding the accused, Former President Joseph Ejercito Estrada, GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of PLUNDER defined in and penalized by Republic Act No. 7080, as amended. On the other hand, for failure of the prosecution to prove and establish their guilt beyond reasonable doubt, the Court finds the accused Jose \u201cJinggoy\u201d Estrada and Atty. Edward S. Serapio NOT GUILTY of the crime of plunder, and accordingly, the Court hereby orders their ACQUITTAL.The penalty imposable for the crime of plunder under Republic Act No. 7080,[11] as amended by Republic Act No. 7659,[12] is Reclusion Perpetua to Death. There being no aggravating or mitigating circumstances, however, the lesser penalty shall be applied in accordance with Article 63 of the Revised Penal Code.[13] Accordingly, the accused Former President Joseph Ejercito Estrada is hereby sentenced to suffer the penalty of Reclusion Perpetua and the accessory penalties of civil interdiction during the period of sentence and perpetual absolute disqualification.The period within which accused Former President Joseph Ejercito Estrada has been under detention shall be credited to him in full as long as he agrees voluntarily in writing to abide by the same disciplinary rules imposed upon convicted prisoners.Moreover, in accordance with Section 2 of Republic Act No. 7080, as amended by Republic Act No. 7659, the Court hereby declares the forfeiture in favor of the government of the following:(1) The total amount of Five Hundred Forty Two Million Seven Ninety One Thousand Pesos (?545,291,000.00)[14] with interest and income earned, inclusive of the amount of Two Hundred Million Pesos (?200,000,000.00), deposited in the name and account of the Erap Muslim Youth Foundation.(2) The amount of One Hundred Eighty Nine Million Pesos (P189,000,000.00), inclusive of interests and income earned, deposited in the Jose Velarde account.(3) The real property consisting of a house and lot dubbed as \u201cBoracay Mansion\u201d located at #100 11th Street, New Manila, Quezon City.The cash bonds posted by accused Jose \u201cJinggoy\u201d Estrada and Atty. Edward S. Serapio are hereby ordered cancelled and released to the said accused or their duly authorized representatives upon presentation of the original receipt evidencing payment thereof and subject to the usual accounting and auditing procedures. Likewise, the hold-departure orders issued against the said accused are hereby recalled and declared functus officio.SO ORDERED.[15] (Emphasis and citations supplied)On October 25, 2007, then President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo granted pardon to Estrada.

This petition, docketed as SPA No. 13-211 (DC), was filed pursuant to Section 40 of Republic Act No. 7160, otherwise known as the Local Government Code of 1991 (the Local Government Code),[20] in relation to Section 12 of Batas Pambansa Blg. 881, otherwise known as the Omnibus Election Code.[21] It sought to disqualify Estrada from running for Mayor of the City of Manila on account of his conviction for plunder and having been sentenced to suffer the penalty of reclusion perpetua, and the accessory penalties of civil interdiction and perpetual absolute disqualification.[22]Estrada filed his answer[23] on January 24, 2013.On April 1, 2013, the COMELEC Second Division issued the first assailed resolution dismissing Risos-Vidal\u2019s petition for lack of merit.In this resolution, the COMELEC Second Division noted that in 2010, following Estrada\u2019s filing of a certificate of candidacy for President of the Philippines, two disqualification cases \u2014 SPA No. 09-028 (DC) and SPA No. 09-104 (DC) \u2014 were filed against him. It added that, in deciding these disqualification cases \u2014 first, through the resolution dated January 20, 2010 of the COMELEC Second Division and, second, through the resolution of the COMELEC En Banc dated May 4, 2010 \u2014 the Commission on Elections had already ruled that the pardon granted to Estrada was absolute and unconditional and, hence, did not prevent him from running for public office. Thus, the matter of Estrada\u2019s qualification, in relation to the efficacy of the penalties imposed on him on account of his conviction for plunder, \u201cha[d] been passed upon and ruled out by this Commission way back in 2010.\u201d[24]In the resolution dated April 23, 2013, the COMELEC En Banc denied Risos-Vidal\u2019s motion for reconsideration.On April 30, 2013, Risos-Vidal filed the present petition.[25] Risos-Vidal ascribed grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction on COMELEC in not disqualifying Estrada. She assailed COMELEC\u2019s refusal to grant her petition on account of its having supposedly ruled on the same issues in the disqualification cases filed in connection with Estrada\u2019s 2010 bid for the presidency.[26] She asserted that Estrada\u2019s pardon was conditional and served neither to restore his rights \u201cto vote, be voted upon and to hold public office\u201d[27] nor to remit the accessory penalty of perpetual absolute disqualification.[28] She added that, for having been convicted of plunder, a crime involving moral turpitude, Estrada was barred from running for Mayor by Section 40 of the Local Government Code.[29] Insisting that the grounds for disqualifying Estrada were so manifest, she faulted COMELEC for not having disqualified motu proprio.[30]In the meantime, elections were conducted on May 13, 2013. Per COMELEC\u2019s \u201cCertificate of Canvass of Votes and Proclamation of Winning Candidates for National Capital Region \u2013 Manila\u201d dated May 17, 2013,[31] Estrada was noted to have obtained 349,770 votes.[32] His opponent in the mayoralty race, Lim, obtained 313,764 votes,[33] giving the lead to Estrada. Estrada was, thus, proclaimed as the \u201cduly elected\u201d[34] city mayor.On June 7, 2013, Lim filed a motion for leave to intervene[35] to which was attached his petition-in-intervention.[36] He argued that, regardless of whether the pardon granted to Estrada was absolute or conditional, it did not expressly restore his right of suffrage and his right to hold public office, and it did not remit his perpetual absolute disqualification as required by Articles 36[37] and 41[38] of the Revised Penal Code. Thus, he remained ineligible for election into public office.[39] He added that, per this court\u2019s decision in Dominador Jalosjos, Jr. v. COMELEC,[40] he had the \u201cright to be declared and proclaimed mayor of Manila upon the declaration of respondent Estrada\u2019s disqualification.\u201d[41]In the resolution[42] dated June 25, 2013, this court granted Lim\u2019s motion for leave to intervene and required respondents to file their comments on Lim\u2019s petition-in-intervention in addition to filing their comment on Risos-Vidal\u2019s petition.On July 15, 2013, Estrada filed his comment on Lim\u2019s petition-in-intervention.[43] He argued that Lim lacked \u201clegal standing to prosecute this case,\u201d[44] that the pardon granted to him restored his right to seek public office,[45] and that Articles 36 and 41 of the Revised Penal Code are not only unconstitutional, as they diminish the pardoning power of the President,[46] but have also been repealed by subsequent election laws (e.g., Section 94 of Commonwealth Act No. 357[47] and Section 12 of the Omnibus Election Code[48]), which recognize \u201cplenary pardon[s].\u201d He added that Risos-Vidal\u2019s assertions that President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo could not have intended for Estrada\u2019s pardon to be absolute as they were \u201cpolitical rivals\u201d[49] is a factual issue that required the \u201cremand\u201d[50] of the case to the Court of Appeals or the reception of evidence through oral arguments.[51]On July 29, 2013, public respondent COMELEC, through the Office of the Solicitor General (OSG) filed its consolidated comment.[52] It noted that the effects of the pardon granted to Estrada had already been ruled upon by COMELEC in connection with disqualification cases filed against him on the occasion of his 2010 bid for the presidency.[53] It added that Estrada\u2019s rights to vote and be voted for had indeed been restored and his perpetual disqualification remitted by the pardon granted to him.On August 6, 2013, Estrada filed his comment[54] on Risos-Vidal\u2019s petition. In addition to arguing that he was granted an absolute pardon which rendered him eligible to run and be voted as mayor, Estrada argued that the present case involves the same issues as those in the 2010 disqualification cases filed against him, that \u201cthe findings of fact of the public respondent COMELEC relative to the absoluteness of the pardon, the effects thereof and the eligibility of the Private Respondent Estrada are binding and conclusive\u201d[55] on this court, and that the allegations made by Risos-Vidal are insufficient to disturb the assailed resolutions.[56] He added that Risos-Vidal\u2019s petition before the COMELEC was filed out of time, it being, in reality, a petition to deny due course to or to cancel his certificate of candidacy, and not a petition for disqualification.[57] He also asserted that Dominador Jalosjos, Jr. was inapplicable to the present case.[58] Finally, he claimed that his disqualification would mean the disenfranchisement of the voters who elected him.[59]On August 23, 2013, Lim filed his reply to Estrada\u2019s comment on his petition-in-intervention and to COMELEC\u2019s consolidated comment.[60] On August 27, 2013, Risos-Vidal filed her reply[61] to Estrada\u2019s comment on her petition. On December 13, 2013, Risos-Vidal filed her reply[62] to COMELEC\u2019s consolidated comment.In the resolution dated April 22, 2014, the petition and petition-in-intervention were given due course and the parties required to submit their memoranda. The parties complied: Lim on May 27, 2014,[63] Risos-Vidal on June 2, 2014,[64] Estrada on June 16, 2014;[65] and COMELEC on June 26, 2014.[66]IIIStatement of issuesFor resolution are the following issues:A. Procedural issuesWhether the petition filed by petitioner Atty. Alicia Risos-Vidal before the COMELEC was filed on time;Whether petitioner-intervenor Alfredo S. Lim may intervene in this case; andWhether COMELEC\u2019s rulings in the disqualification cases filed against private respondent Joseph Ejercito Estrada in connection with his 2010 bid for the presidency bar the consideration of the petition filed by petitioner Atty. Alicia Risos-Vidal before the COMELEC, as well as the present petition for certiorari.B. Substantive issuesWhether private respondent Joseph Ejercito Estrada was qualified to run for Mayor of the City of Manila; andAssuming private respondent Joseph Ejercito Estrada was not qualified, whether petitioner-intervenor Alfredo S. Lim should be declared Mayor of the City of Manila.At the core of this case is the issue of whether Estrada was qualified to run for Mayor of the City of Manila. Estrada, however, has invoked several procedural issues that, if decided in his favor, would effectively impede this court\u2019s having to rule on the substantive issue of his qualification. All of these procedural obstacles lack merit and should not prevent this court from ruling on Estrada\u2019s qualification.IVThe petition filed by petitioner Atty. Alicia Risos-Vidal with COMELEC was filed on timeEstrada argues that the petition filed by Risos-Vidal before the COMELEC should be treated as a petition to deny due course to or to cancel a certificate of candidacy (CoC) under Section 78 of Batas Pambansa Blg. 881, otherwise known as the Omnibus Election Code[67] (Section 78 petition). He claims that the petition effectively assailed the falsity of a representation he made in his CoC \u2014 that is, that he was eligible for the office he sought to be elected to \u2014 and, therefore, invoked a ground for a Section 78 petition, rather than a ground for a petition for disqualification.Estrada adds that Rule 23, Section 2 of COMELEC Resolution No. 9523[68] provides that a Section 78 petition must be filed within five (5) days from the last day for filing a CoC, but not later than 25 days from the time of the filing of the CoC specifically subject of the petition. He claims that, since Risos-Vidal\u2019s petition was all but a \u201ccamouflaged\u201d[69] petition for disqualification, Rule 25, Section 3 of COMELEC Resolution No. 9523,[70] which allows for petitions for disqualification to be \u201cfiled any day after the last day for filing of certificates of candidacy, but not later than the date of proclamation\u201d finds no application. As Risos-Vidal\u2019s petition was filed before the COMELEC on January 14, 2013 \u2014 one hundred and four (104) days removed from October 2, 2012, when he filed his CoC \u2014 Estrada argues that Risos-Vidal\u2019s petition was belatedly filed and, hence, should have been summarily dismissed by COMELEC.Estrada\u2019s assertion is erroneous.This court\u2019s 2008 decision in Fermin v. COMELEC[71] allowed for an opportunity \u201cto dichotomize, once and for all, two popular remedies to prevent a candidate from running for an elective position which are indiscriminately interchanged by the Bench and the Bar\u201d:[72] on the one hand, a petition to deny due course to or to cancel a certificate of candidacy under Section 78 of the Omnibus Election Code and, on the other, a petition for disqualification under Section 68 of the Omnibus Election Code (Section 68 petition).The two remedies, and their distinctions, were discussed in the course of this court\u2019s characterization of the petition involved in Fermin \u2014 whether it was a Section 78 petition or a Section 68 petition \u2014 considering that such petition was anchored on an allegation that a candidate for Mayor was ineligible for failing to satisfy the requirement of residency of at least one (1) year immediately preceding the election. The problem of characterization is the same issue facing us at this juncture:Lest it be misunderstood, the denial of due course to or the cancellation of the CoC is not based on the lack of qualifications but on a finding that the candidate made a material representation that is false, which may relate to the qualifications required of the public office he/she is running for. It is noted that the candidate states in his/her CoC that he/she is eligible for the office he/she seeks. Section 78 of the OEC, therefore, is to be read in relation to the constitutional and statutory provisions on qualifications or eligibility for public office. If the candidate subsequently states a material representation in the CoC that is false, the COMELEC, following the law, is empowered to deny due course to or cancel such certificate. Indeed, the Court has already likened a proceeding under Section 78 to a quo warranto proceeding under Section 253 of the OEC since they both deal with the eligibility or qualification of a candidate, with the distinction mainly in the fact that a \u201cSection 78\u201d petition is filed before proclamation, while a petition for quo warranto is filed after proclamation of the winning candidate.At this point, we must stress that a \"Section 78\" petition ought not to be interchanged or confused with a \"Section 68\" petition. They are different remedies, based on different grounds, and resulting in different eventualities. . . .The ground raised in the Dilangalen petition is that Fermin allegedly lacked one of the qualifications to be elected as mayor of Northern Kabuntalan, i.e., he had not established residence in the said locality for at least one year immediately preceding the election. Failure to meet the one-year residency requirement for the public office is not a ground for the \"disqualification\" of a candidate under Section 68. [Section 68] only refers to the commission of prohibited acts and the possession of a permanent resident status in a foreign country as grounds for disqualification, thus:SEC. 68. Disqualifications.\u2013Any candidate who, in an action or protest in which he is a party is declared by final decision of a competent court guilty of, or found by the Commission of having (a) given money or other material consideration to influence, induce or corrupt the voters or public officials performing electoral functions; (b) committed acts of terrorism to enhance his candidacy; (c) spent in his election campaign an amount in excess of that allowed by this Code; (d) solicited, received or made any contribution prohibited under Sections 89, 95, 96, 97 and 104; or (e) violated any of Sections 80, 83, 85, 86 and 261, paragraphs d, e, k, v, and cc, subparagraph 6, shall be disqualified from continuing as a candidate, or if he has been elected, from holding the office. Any person who is a permanent resident of or an immigrant to a foreign country shall not be qualified to run for any elective office under this Code, unless said person has waived his status as a permanent resident or immigrant of a foreign country in accordance with the residence requirement provided for in the election laws.Likewise, the other provisions of law referring to \"disqualification\" do not include the lack of the one-year residency qualification as a ground therefor, thus:Section 12 of the OECSEC. 12. Disqualifications.\u2013Any person who has been declared by competent authority insane or incompetent, or has been sentenced by final judgment for subversion, insurrection, rebellion, or for any offense for which he has been sentenced to a penalty of more than eighteen months or for a crime involving moral turpitude, shall be disqualified to be a candidate and to hold any office, unless he has been given plenary pardon or granted amnesty.The disqualifications to be a candidate herein provided shall be deemed removed upon the declaration by competent authority that said insanity or incompetence had been removed or after the expiration of a period of five years from his service or sentence, unless within the same period he again becomes disqualified.Section 40 of the Local Government Code (LGC)SECTION 40. Disqualifications\u2013The following persons are disqualified from running for any elective local position:(a) Those sentence by final judgment for an offense involving moral turpitude or for an offense punishable by one (1) year or more of imprisonment, within two (2) years after serving sentence;(b) Those removed from office as a result of an administrative case;(c) Those convicted by final judgment for violating the oath of allegiance to the Republic;(d) Those with dual citizenship;(e) Fugitive from justice in criminal or nonpolitical cases here or abroad;(f) Permanent residents in a foreign country or those who have acquired the right to reside abroad and continue to avail of the same right after the effectivity of this Code; and(g) The insane or feeble-minded.Considering that the Dilangalen petition does not state any of these grounds for disqualification, it cannot be categorized as a \"Section 68\" petition.To emphasize, a petition for disqualification, on the one hand, can be premised on Section 12 or 68 of the [Omnibus Election Code], or Section 40 of the [Local Government Code]. On the other hand, a petition to deny due course to or cancel a CoC can only be grounded on a statement of a material representation in the said certificate that is false. . . .[73] (Emphasis supplied, citations omitted)The quoted discussion clearly establishes the distinction of when it is proper to resort to a Section 78 petition as against a petition for disqualification under Section 68 of the Omnibus Election Code: (1) a Section 78 petition is proper when a statement of a material representation in a certificate of candidacy is false; and (2) a Section 68 petition is proper when disqualification is sought on account of having committed electoral offenses and/or possession of status as a permanent resident in a foreign country.Fermin, however, did not just touch on petitions for disqualification anchored on Section 68 of the Omnibus Election Code, but also on petitions for disqualification anchored on Section 12 of the Omnibus Election Code and on Section 40 of the Local Government Code. Fermin made the pronouncement that Section 12 of the Omnibus Election Code and Section 40 of the Local Government Code are equally valid grounds for a petition for disqualification. Nevertheless, Fermin was not categorical on when a petition for disqualification anchored on these statutory provisions may be resorted to vis-\u00e0-vis a Section 78 petition.A subsequent case, Aratea v. COMELEC,[74] affirms that petitions for disqualification may be anchored on Section 12 of the Omnibus Election Code, and/or Section 40 of the Local Government Code, much as they can be anchored on Section 68 of the Omnibus Election Code: \u201cA petition for disqualification can only be premised on a ground specified in Section 12 or 68 of the Omnibus Election Code or Section 40 of the Local Government Code.\u201d[75]Likewise, Rule 25, Section 1 of COMELEC Resolution No. 9523 indicates that a petition for disqualification is based on legally (i.e., by Constitution or by statute) prescribed disqualifications. It provides:Section 1. Grounds. \u2014 Any candidate who, in an action or protest in which he is a party, is declared by final decision of a competent court, guilty of, or found by the Commission to be suffering from any disqualification provided by law or the Constitution.A Petition to Disqualify a Candidate invoking grounds for a Petition to Deny to or Cancel a Certificate of Candidacy or Petition to Declare a Candidate as a Nuisance Candidate, or a combination thereof, shall be summarily dismissed. (Emphasis supplied)However, Aratea and COMELEC Resolution No. 9523, like Fermin, are uncategorical on the availability of petitions for disqualification anchored on Section 12 of the Omnibus Election Code and/or Section 40 of the Local Government Code vis-\u00e0-vis resort to Section 78 petitions. Any standing ambiguity was settled by this court\u2019s discussion in Dominador Jalosjos, Jr. v. Commission on Elections.[76]In Dominador Jalosjos, Jr., this court affirmed the COMELEC\u2019s grant of a Section 78 petition and sustained the cancellation of the certificate of candidacy filed by Dominador Jalosjos, Jr. in his bid to be elected Mayor of Dapitan City, Zamboanga del Norte in the May 10, 2010 elections. This cancellation was premised on a finding that Jalosjos, Jr. made a material misrepresentation in his CoC in stating that he was eligible for election. Jalosjos, Jr. had previously been convicted of robbery and sentenced to suffer the accessory penalty of perpetual special disqualification. In sustaining the cancellation of his CoC, this court reasoned:The perpetual special disqualification against Jalosjos arising from his criminal conviction by final judgment is a material fact involving eligibility which is a proper ground for a petition under Section 78 of the Omnibus Election Code.. . . .A false statement in a certificate of candidacy that a candidate is eligible to run for public office is a false material representation which is a ground for a petition under Section 78 of the same Code. . . .. . . .Section 74 requires the candidate to state under oath in his certificate of candidacy \"that he is eligible for said office.\" A candidate is eligible if he has a right to run for the public office. If a candidate is not actually eligible because he is barred by final judgment in a criminal case from running for public office, and he still states under oath in his certificate of candidacy that he is eligible to run for public office, then the candidate clearly makes a false material representation that is a ground for a petition under Section 78.[77] (Citations omitted)From these, it is clear that a false claim of eligibility made in a certificate of candidacy despite a prior conviction which carries with it the accessory penalty of disqualification is a ground for a Section 78 petition. Nevertheless, it is also a ground for a petition for disqualification. As explained in Dominador Jalosjos, Jr.:What is indisputably clear is that the false material representation of Jalosjos is a ground for a petition under Section 78. However, since the false material representation arises from a crime penalized by prisi\u00f3n mayor, a petition under Section 12 of the Omnibus Election Code or Section 40 of the Local Government Code can also be properly filed. The petitioner has a choice whether to anchor his petition on Section 12 or Section 78 of the Omnibus Election Code, or on Section 40 of the Local Government Code. The law expressly provides multiple remedies and the choice of which remedy to adopt belongs to the petitioner.[78]The concurrent availability of a Section 78 petition with a petition for disqualification should not be interpreted as diminishing the distinction between the two (2) remedies.The pivotal consideration in a Section 78 petition is material misrepresentation relating to qualifications for elective public office. To \u201cmisrepresent\u201d is \u201cto describe (someone or something) in a false way especially in order to deceive someone.\u201d[79] It, therefore, connotes malevolent intent or bad faith that impels one to adulterate information. A Section 78 petition thus, squarely applies to instances in which a candidate is fully aware of a matter of fact that disqualifies him or her but conceals or otherwise falsely depicts that fact as to make it appear that he or she is qualified. A petition for disqualification, on the other hand, may apply in cases where a disqualification exists but, because of an attendant ambiguity (such as an unsettled legal question), a candidate acts in good faith and without any deliberate attempt to conceal or mislead.Right at the onset, the petition filed by Risos-Vidal before the COMELEC on January 14, 2013 asserts that it was filed pursuant to Section 40 of the Local Government Code, \u201cin relation to\u201d[80] Section 12 of the Omnibus Election Code:This is a petition pursuant to Sec. 40 of R.A. No. 7160, otherwise known as \u201cThe Local Government Code of 1991\u201d, in relation to Sec. 12 of BP Blg. 881, otherwise known as the \u201cOmnibus Election Code of the Philippines\u201d, seeking to disqualify former President Joseph Ejercito Estrada from running for the mayoralty position in Manila in the coming May 13, 2013 elections, on the ground of his prior conviction of the crime of plunder by the Sandiganbayan and his having been sentenced to reclusion perpetua with the accessory penalties of civil interdiction and perpetual absolute disqualification.[81] (Emphasis supplied)This petition posits that Estrada is disqualified from running as Mayor of the City of Manila, pursuant to Section 40 of the Local Government Code, as follows:Sec. 40 of the LGC provides that a person sentenced by final judgment for an offense involving moral turpitude or for an offense punishable by imprisonment of one (1) year or more is disqualified from running for any elective local position.As earlier said, respondent was sentenced in Crim. Case No. 26558 to suffer the penalty of reclusion perpetua.He was, however, granted pardon by former Pres. Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo, thus, did not serve his sentence in full.Nonetheless, while the pardon did restore to him his civil and political rights, it did not restore to him his right to run for or hold public office or the right of suffrage because it was not expressly restored by the terms of the pardon. . . .[82]This petition unambiguously anchors itself on statutorily prescribed disqualifications \u2014 under Section 40 of the Local Government Code, as well as Section 12 of the Omnibus Election Code \u2014 which jurisprudence has explicitly recognized as a valid basis for both a petition for disqualification and a Section 78 petition.It follows that the petition was filed on time. The petition was filed on January 14, 2013, after the last day for filing of certificates of candidacy, and before the date of Estrada\u2019s proclamation as Mayor on May 17, 2013. This is within the period permitted by Rule 25, Section 3 of COMELEC Resolution No. 9523.VAlfredo S. Lim may intervene in the present petition for certiorariCiting Section 44 of the Local Government Code[83] \u2014 on succession in case of permanent vacancies in the Office of the Mayor \u2014 and jurisprudence to the effect that \u201cthe candidate who obtains the second highest number of votes may not be proclaimed winner in case the winning candidate is disqualified,\u201d[84] Estrada claims that \u201cthe party who stands to benefit in the event of [his] disqualification is none other than the duly elected Vice-Mayor of the City of Manila, Isko Moreno.\u201d[85] Thus, he asserts that \u201cit is clear that Lim has NO LEGAL STANDING to institute his Petition-In-Intervention.\u201d[86]In the first place, Estrada is erroneously invoking the concept of \u201clegal standing.\u201d What Estrada is really questioning is whether Lim is a real party in interest.The distinction between the rule on standing and real party in interest was extensively discussed by this court in Kilosbayan v. Morato:[87]Not only is petitioners' standing a legal issue that may be determined again in this case. It is, strictly speaking, not even the issue in this case, since standing is a concept in constitutional law and here no constitutional question is actually involved. The issue in this case is whether petitioners are the \"real parties in interest\" within the meaning of Rule 3, \u00a72 of the Rules of Court which requires that \"Every action must be prosecuted and defended in the name of the real party in interest.\"The difference between the rule on standing and real party in interest has been noted by authorities thus: \"It is important to note . . . that standing because of its constitutional and public policy underpinnings, is very different from questions relating to whether a particular plaintiff is the real party in interest or has capacity to sue. Although all three requirements are directed towards ensuring that only certain parties can maintain an action, standing restrictions require a partial consideration of the merits, as well as broader policy concerns relating to the proper role of the judiciary in certain areas. (FRIEDENTHAL, KANE AND MILLER, CIVIL PROCEDURE 328 (1985))Standing is a special concern in constitutional law because in some cases suits are brought not by parties who have been personally injured by the operation of a law or by official action taken, but by concerned citizens, taxpayers or voters who actually sue in the public interest. Hence the question in standing is whether such parties have \"alleged such a personal stake in the outcome of the controversy as to assure that concrete adverseness which sharpens the presentation of issues upon which the court so largely depends for illumination of difficult constitutional questions.\" (Baker v. Carr, 369 U.S. 186, 7 L.Ed. 2d 633 (1962)). . . .On the other hand, the question as to \"real party in interest\" is whether he is \"the party who would be benefitted or injured by the judgment, or the `party entitled to the avails of the suit.'\" (Salonga v. Warner Barnes & Co., Ltd., 88 Phil. 125, 131 (1951))[88] (Emphasis supplied)In seeking to intervene, Lim has made no pretensions of acting as a representative of the general public and, thus, advancing the public interest. He merely prays that he be declared the elected Mayor of the City of Manila following a declaration that Estrada was disqualified to run for the same post. Though what is involved is a public office, what Lim seeks to enforce is, fundamentally, a (supposed) right accruing to him personally to assume an office.Lim has enough interest at stake in this case as would enable him to intervene.Rule 19, Section 1 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure provides for who may intervene in a pending court action:Section 1. Who may intervene. \u2014 A person who has a legal interest in the matter in litigation, or in the success of either of the parties, or an interest against both, or is so situated as to be adversely affected by a distribution or other disposition of property in the custody of the court or of an officer thereof may, with leave of court, be allowed to intervene in the action. The court shall consider whether or not the intervention will unduly delay or prejudice the adjudication of the rights of the original parties, and whether or not the intervenor's rights may be fully protected in a separate proceeding. (Emphasis supplied)The requirement of \u201clegal interest\u201d was discussed in Magsaysay-Labrador v. Court of Appeals,[89] as follows:The interest which entitles a person to intervene in a suit between other parties must be in the matter in litigation and of such direct and immediate character that the intervenor will either gain or lose by the direct legal operation and effect of the judgment. Otherwise, if persons not parties of the action could be allowed to intervene, proceedings will become unnecessarily complicated, expensive and interminable. And this is not the policy of the law.The words \"an interest in the subject\" mean a direct interest in the cause of action as pleaded, and which would put the intervenor in a legal position to litigate a fact alleged in the complaint, without the establishment of which plaintiff could not recover.[90] (Emphasis supplied)It is true that the principal matter for resolution in this case is whether Estrada, based on circumstances personally applying to him, was qualified to run for Mayor of the City of Manila. Nevertheless, the logical consequence of a decision adverse to Estrada is the need to identify who shall, henceforth, assume the position of Mayor.Lim claims that he is entitled to replace Estrada. In support of this, he cites a decision of this court[91] and claims that, as a disqualified candidate, the votes cast for Estrada should be deemed stray votes. This would result in Lim being the qualified candidate obtaining the highest number of votes, which would, in turn, entitle him to being proclaimed the elected Mayor of the City of Manila.It is worth emphasizing that \u201c[t]he purpose of intervention is to enable a stranger to an action to become a party in order for him to protect his interest and for the court to settle all conflicting claims. Intervention is allowed to avoid multiplicity of suits more than on due process considerations.\u201d[92] Lim\u2019s intervention serves this purpose. It enables the resolution of an issue which is corollary to one of the two ways by which this court may decide on the issue of Estrada\u2019s disqualification.VIThis case is not barred by COMELEC\u2019s rulings in the disqualification cases filed against Estrada in connection with his 2010 bid for the presidencya. Estrada\u2019s theory: case is barred by res judicata Estrada avers that in 2010, in connection with what was then his second bid for the presidency of the Republic, two (2) disqualification cases were filed against him: one, by a certain Atty. Evilio C. Pormento, docketed as SPA No. 09-028 (DC); and two, by a certain Mary Lou B. Estrada, docketed as SPA No. 09-104 (DC). In the resolution dated January 20, 2010,[93] the COMELEC Second Division denied these disqualification petitions for lack of merit and upheld Estrada\u2019s qualification to run for President. In the resolution dated April 27, 2010,[94] the COMELEC En Banc denied Mary Lou B. Estrada\u2019s motion for reconsideration. In another resolution dated May 4, 2010, the COMELEC En Banc denied Pormento\u2019s motion for reconsideration.[95]Estrada claims that \u201c[t]he issue surrounding the character of [his] pardon and eligibility to seek public elective office was already extensively dealt with and passed upon\u201d[96] in these disqualification cases. He asserts that as these cases involved and resolved \u201cthe same or identical issues,\u201d[97] the present case is now barred by res judicata.Estrada draws particular attention to the following pronouncement of the COMELEC Second Division in its January 20, 2010 resolution:Furthermore, there is absolutely no indication that the executive clemency exercised by President Arroyo to pardon Former President Estrada was a mere conditional pardon. It clearly stated that the former president is \u201crestored to his civil and political rights\u201d and there is nothing in the same which limits this restoration. The only therein stated that may have some bearing on the supposed conditions is that statement in the whereas clause thereof that contained the following: \u201cWHEREAS, Joseph Ejercito Estrada has publicly committed to no longer seek any elective position or office\u201d, but that is not really a condition but is merely part of a preliminary statement, referring to what respondent Estrada had said publicly. There is nothing stated in the dispositive part that it was conditioned upon said respondent\u2019s purported public commitment. His public statement cannot, therefore, serve to restrict the operation of, or prevail over the explicit statement in the executive clemency which restored all of Estrada\u2019s civil and political rights, including \u201cthe right to vote and to be voted for a public office,\u201d including to the position of the Presidency. This executive clemency granted to the former President being absolute and unconditional and having been accepted by him, the same can no longer be revoked or be made subject to a condition.[98]b. The 2010 disqualification cases and Risos-Vidal\u2019s petition are anchored on different causes of action and, hence, involve different issues and subject mattersRes judicata was discussed in Pryce Corporation v. China Banking Corporation[99] as follows:According to the doctrine of res judicata, \"a final judgment or decree on the merits by a court of competent jurisdiction is conclusive of the rights of the parties or their privies in all later suits on all points and matters determined in the former suit.\"The elements for res judicata to apply are as follows: (a) the former judgment was final; (b) the court that rendered it had jurisdiction over the subject matter and the parties; (c) the judgment was based on the merits; and (d) between the first and the second actions, there was an identity of parties, subject matters, and causes of action.Res judicata embraces two concepts: (1) bar by prior judgment and (2) conclusiveness of judgment.Bar by prior judgment exists \"when, as between the first case where the judgment was rendered and the second case that is sought to be barred, there is identity of parties, subject matter, and causes of action.\"On the other hand, the concept of conclusiveness of judgment finds application \"when a fact or question has been squarely put in issue, judicially passed upon, and adjudged in a former suit by a court of competent jurisdiction.\" This principle only needs identity of parties and issues to apply.[100]The 2010 disqualification cases filed against Estrada in connection with his 2010 bid for the presidency do not bar the present case on account of res judicata.For one, the 2010 disqualification cases filed by Atty. Evilio C. Pormento and Mary Lou B. Estrada involved issues and were anchored on causes of action that are markedly different from those in the present case. These cases were anchored on the constitutional prohibition against a President\u2019s re-election, as provided by Article VII, Section 4 of the 1987 Constitution,[101] and the additional ground that Estrada was a nuisance candidate. To the contrary, the present case is anchored on Estrada\u2019s conviction for plunder which carried with it the accessory penalty of perpetual absolute disqualification and invokes Section 40 of the Local Government Code, as well as Section 12 of the Omnibus Election Code.The COMELEC Second Division, summarizing the circumstances of the petition for disqualification subject of SPA No. 09-028 (DC), filed by Atty. Evilio C. Pormento, stated:Petitioner Evilio C. Pormento filed the first case against Respondent Joseph Ejercito Estrada on December 05, 2009. It was properly titled an \u201cUrgent Petition for Disqualification as Presidential Candidate\u201d. This Petition is premised on the specific provision of Article VII, section 4 of the 1987 Constitution a portion of which stated that: xxx the President shall not be eligible for any re-election.\u201d[102] (Emphasis in the original)On the other hand, summarizing the circumstances of the petition filed by Mary Lou B. Estrada, the COMELEC Second Division stated:The second of the above-entitled cases was filed on December 12, 2009, by Petitioner Mary Lou Estrada alleging that the name of Joseph M. Ejercito Estrada might cause confusion to her prejudice. She filed a \u201cPetition to Disqualify Estrada Ejercito Joseph M. From running as President due to Constitutional Disqualification and Creating Confusion to the Prejudice of Estrada, Mary Lou B\u201d and prayed for the disqualification of the Respondent and to have his Certificate of Candidacy (COC) cancelled. She also made reference to the Respondent being a \u201cNuisance Candidate\u201d.[103] (Emphasis supplied)That these disqualification cases involved issues and invoked causes of action that are different from those in this case is evident in the recital of issues in the COMELEC Second Division\u2019s January 20, 2010 resolution:THE ISSUES IN THE TWO CASES(a) Whether or not Respondent Joseph Ejercito Estrada is qualified to be a candidate for the position of President of the Philippines in the forthcoming elections on May 10, 2010, despite the fact that he had previously been elected to, assumed and discharged the duties of, the same position;(b) Whether or not, former President Estrada may be considered a nuisance candidate in view of the Constitutional prohibition against any reelection of a former President who has previously elected and had assumed the same position.[104] (Emphasis supplied)This, too, is evident, in the resolution\u2019s introductory paragraphs:At the very core of the controversy involved in these two cases which stands like a stratospheric totem pole is the specific provision under Sec. 4 of Article VII of the 1987 Constitution which states:. . . .This Commission (Second Division) is confronted with the dilemma of deciding a brewing controversy considering the above Constitutional provision which prohibits reelection of \u201cthe President\u201d; that is, whether former President Joseph Ejercito \u201cErap\u201d Estrada may or may not be allowed to run in the coming May 2010 elections for the same position of the President of the Republic of the Philippines?[105] (Emphasis supplied)Whatever pronouncement the COMELEC Second Division made on the matter of Estrada\u2019s conviction for plunder and subsequent pardon was thus a superfluity. Ultimately, it was unnecessary to the resolution of the issues involved in the disqualification cases filed by Atty. Evilio C. Pormento and Mary Lou B. Estrada. It was nothing more than obiter dictum.Another disqualification case filed in connection with Estrada\u2019s 2010 bid for the presidency, which, however, Estrada did not cite in his averments was Rev. Elly Velez B. Lao Pamatong, ESQ, petitioner, vs. Joseph Ejercito Estrada and Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo, SPA No. 09-024 (DC). This case was similarly focused on the constitutional prohibition against a President\u2019s re-election and on the allegation that Estrada was a nuisance candidate:The bone of contention of this controversy revolves around the interpretation of the specific provisions of Sec. 4 of Article VII of the 1987 Constitution. . . .[106]Its recital of issues reads:From the foregoing, the Commission (Second Division) hereby rules on the following issues:(a) Can a former elected President be qualified to become a Presidential Candidate and be elected again to the same position he or she previously occupied?(b) May President Arroyo being a sitting President be allowed to run for any elected position such as a member of the House of Representatives?(c) Are President Arroyo and Former President Estrada nuisance candidates?[107]That the 2010 disqualification cases were anchored on a constitutional provision relating to the executive branch of government, while the present case is anchored on the provisions of the Local Government Code on the disqualification of candidates for local elective offices, makes evident that the former entailed a different subject matter. While the 2010 disqualification cases relate to Estrada\u2019s bid for the presidency, the present case relates to his bid to become Mayor of the City of Manila.c. There was no final judgment on the merits arising from the 2010 disqualification cases Not only do the 2010 disqualification cases involve different issues, causes of action, and subject matters, but these disqualification cases do not even have a final judgment on the merits to speak of.Cabreza, Jr. v. Cabreza[108] explains the concept of a \u201cjudgment on the merits\u201d as follows:A judgment may be considered as one rendered on the merits \u201cwhen it determines the rights and liabilities of the parties based on the disclosed facts, irrespective of formal, technical or dilatory objections\u201d; or when the judgment is rendered \u201cafter a determination of which party is right, as distinguished from a judgment rendered upon some preliminary or formal or merely technical point.\u201d[109]Following the denial of his motion for reconsideration by the COMELEC En Banc, Atty. Evilio C. Pormento sought relief from this court via a petition for certiorari, insisting that Estrada was barred by Article VII, Section 4 of the Constitution from making a second bid for the presidency. This petition was docketed as G.R. No. 191988 and entitled Atty. Evilio C. Pormento, petitioner, vs. Joseph \u201cErap\u201d Ejercito Estrada and Commission on Elections, respondents.As noted by this court in its August 31, 2010 resolution in Pormento v. Estrada,[110] the May 10, 2010 elections proceeded without Estrada having been removed from the list of candidates or otherwise being restricted in his candidacy as \u201cunder the Rules of Court, the filing of such petition would not stay the execution of the judgment, final order or resolution of the COMELEC that is sought to be reviewed[; moreover,] petitioner did not even pray for the issuance of a temporary restraining order or writ of preliminary injunction.\u201d[111] Thus, Estrada was able to participate in the May 10, 2010 presidential elections. He, however, only obtained the second highest number of votes and was, thus, not proclaimed winner.Not having been elected President for a second time, this court ruled that Atty. Evilio C. Pormento\u2019s petition had become moot and academic. Thus, it was denied due course and dismissed:Private respondent was not elected President the second time he ran. Since the issue on the proper interpretation of the phrase \u201cany reelection\u201d will be premised on a person\u2019s second (whether immediate or not) election as President, there is no case or controversy to be resolved in this case. No live conflict of legal rights exists. There is in this case no definite, concrete, real or substantial controversy that touches on the legal relations of parties having adverse legal interests. No specific relief may conclusively be decreed upon by this Court in this case that will benefit any of the parties herein. As such, one of the essential requisites for the exercise of the power of judicial review, the existence of an actual case or controversy, is sorely lacking in this case.As a rule, this Court may only adjudicate actual, ongoing controversies. The Court is not empowered to decide moot questions or abstract propositions, or to declare principles or rules of law which cannot affect the result as to the thing in issue in the case before it. In other words, when a case is moot, it becomes non-justiciable.An action is considered \u201cmoot\u201d when it no longer presents a justiciable controversy because the issues involved have become academic or dead or when the matter in dispute has already been resolved and hence, one is not entitled to judicial intervention unless the issue is likely to be raised again between the parties. There is nothing for the court to resolve as the determination thereof has been overtaken by subsequent events.Assuming an actual case or controversy existed prior to the proclamation of a President who has been duly elected in the May 10, 2010 elections, the same is no longer true today. Following the results of that elections, private respondent was not elected President for the second time. Thus, any discussion of his \u201creelection\u201d will simply be hypothetical and speculative. It will serve no useful or practical purpose.Accordingly, the petition is denied due course and is hereby DISMISSED.SO ORDERED.[112] (Citations omitted)From these, it is plain to see that the substance of Estrada\u2019s qualification (vis-\u00e0-vis Article VII, Section 4 of the 1987 Constitution) was not at all discussed. This court even explicitly stated that were it to make a pronouncement on that matter, this pronouncement would amount to nothing more than a non-binding opinion:What is the proper interpretation of the following provision of Section 4, Article VII of the Constitution: \u201c[t]he President shall not be eligible for any reelection?\u201dThe novelty and complexity of the constitutional issue involved in this case present a temptation that magistrates, lawyers, legal scholars and law students alike would find hard to resist. However, prudence dictates that this Court exercise judicial restraint where the issue before it has already been mooted by subsequent events. More importantly, the constitutional requirement of the existence of a \u201ccase\u201d or an \u201cactual controversy\u201d for the proper exercise of the power of judicial review constrains us to refuse the allure of making a grand pronouncement that, in the end, will amount to nothing but a non-binding opinion.[113]Estrada, though adjudged by the COMELEC Second Division and COMELEC En Banc to be qualified for a second bid at the presidency, was never conclusively adjudged by this court to be so qualified. The 2010 disqualification cases reached their conclusion not because it was determined, once and for all, that Estrada was not disqualified, but because \u2014 with Estrada\u2019s loss in the elections \u2014 there was no longer a controversy to resolve. There was no \u201cdetermin[ation of] the rights and liabilities of the parties based on the disclosed facts, irrespective of formal, technical or dilatory objections\u201d;[114] neither was there \u201ca determination of which party is right.\u201d[115] While the 2010 disqualification cases may have reached their literal end or terminal point, there was no final judgment on the merits.VIIEstrada was disqualified from running for Mayor of the City of Manila in the May 13, 2013 elections and remains disqualified from running for any elective posta. Joseph Ejercito Estrada: convicted, disqualified, and pardoned We now come to the core of this case, that is, whether Estrada was qualified to run for Mayor of the City of Manila.It is not disputed that Estrada was found guilty beyond reasonable doubt and convicted for plunder by the Sandiganbayan. This conviction stands unreversed and unmodified, whether by the Sandiganbayan, on reconsideration, or by this court, on appeal. By this conviction, Estrada was sentenced to suffer the accessory penalty of perpetual absolute disqualification. Per Article 30 of the Revised Penal Code, this accessory penalty produces the effect of, among others, \u201c[t]he deprivation of the right to vote in any election for any popular elective office or to be elected to such office.\u201d[116]Apart from the specific penalty of perpetual absolute disqualification meted on Estrada on account of his conviction, statutory provisions provide for the disqualification from elective public office of individuals who have been convicted for criminal offenses involving moral turpitude[117] and/or entailing a sentence of a defined duration of imprisonment.Section 12 of the Omnibus Election Code provides for disqualifications for elective offices in general:Section 12. Disqualifications. - Any person who has been declared by competent authority insane or incompetent, or has been sentenced by final judgment for subversion, insurrection, rebellion or for any offense for which he has been sentenced to a penalty of more than eighteen months or for a crime involving moral turpitude, shall be disqualified to be a candidate and to hold any office, unless he has been given plenary pardon or granted amnesty.This [sic] disqualifications to be a candidate herein provided shall be deemed removed upon the declaration by competent authority that said insanity or incompetence had been removed or after the expiration of a period of five years from his service of sentence, unless within the same period he again becomes disqualified. (Emphasis supplied)Section 40 of the Local Government Code provides for disqualifications for local elective offices in particular:SECTION 40. Disqualifications. \u2013 The following persons are disqualified from running for any elective local position:(a) Those sentenced by final judgment for an offense involving moral turpitude or for an offense punishable by one (1) year or more of imprisonment, within two (2) years after serving sentence;(b) Those removed from office as a result of an administrative case; (c) Those convicted by final judgment for violating the oath of allegiance to the Republic;(d) Those with dual citizenship;(e) Fugitives from justice in criminal or non-political cases here or abroad;(f) Permanent residents in a foreign country or those who have acquired the right to reside abroad and continue to avail of the same right after the effectivity of this Code; and(g) The insane or feeble-minded. (Emphasis supplied)It is with this backdrop of, on the one hand, Estrada\u2019s conviction for plunder (with its concomitant penalty of absolute perpetual disqualification), as well as the cited statutory disqualifications, and, on the other, the pardon granted to Estrada, that this court must rule on whether Estrada was qualified to run for Mayor of Manila in the May 13, 2013 elections.b. The power to grant clemency: an executive function The power to grant pardons, along with other acts of executive clemency, is vested in the President of the Philippines by Article VII, Section 19 of the 1987 Constitution:Section 19. Except in cases of impeachment, or as otherwise provided in this Constitution, the President may grant reprieves, commutations, and pardons, and remit fines and forfeitures, after conviction by final judgment.He shall also have the power to grant amnesty with the concurrence of a majority of all the Members of the Congress.The recognition that the power to grant clemency is lodged in the executive has been made since the earliest days of the Philippines as a republic. It \u201cis founded on the recognition that human institutions are imperfect and that there are infirmities, deficiencies or flaws in the administration of justice. The power exists as an instrument or means for correcting these infirmities and also for mitigating whatever harshness might be generated by a too strict an application of the law.\u201d[118]Our constitutional history is a cumulative affirmation of the fundamental conception of the power to pardon as an executive power.Provisions from Title VIII of the Malolos Constitution of 1899 read:Article 67 - Apart from the powers necessary to execute laws, it is the duty of the President of the Republic to:Confer civil and military employment in accordance to the law;Appoint Secretaries of Government;Direct diplomatic and commercial relations with other powers;Ensure the swift and complete administration of justice in the entire territory;Pardon lawbreakers in accordance to the law, subject to the provisions relating to the Secretaries of Government;Preside over national solemnities, and welcome accredited envoys and representatives of foreign powers.Article 68 - The President of the Republic needs to be authorized by a special law:To transfer, cede or exchange any part of Philippine territory;To incorporate any other territory into the Philippines;To allow foreign troops in Philippine territory;To ratify treaties of offensive and defensive alliance, special commercial treaties, treaties that stipulate subsidies to a foreign power, and any other treaty that compels Filipinos to perform any individual obligation;In no case can the confidential articles of a treaty nullify those that are public.To grant general amnesties and pardons;To mint money. (Emphasis supplied)Contrasting the provisions of the Malolos Constitution with the present iteration of the pardoning power, it is particularly notable that the power, as provided for in 1899, is deferential to the legislative branch of government. While recognizing the pardoning power as ultimately one for the President to wield, it remained subject to legislative imprimatur.Aided by the lens of history, this is most effectively understood in the context of a \u201cconflict between people, on one hand, who were determined to secure the kind of freedom and economic benefits never enjoyed by them before, and groups, on the other, who wanted to maintain a social status and economic privilege inherited from way back or recently acquired by the displacement of elements formerly controlling the destiny of the colony.\u201d[119] The latter \u2014 ilustrados \u2014 were the driving force behind the adoption of a constitution, and they endeavored \u201cto make the legislature the most powerful unit in the government.\u201d[120]The adoption of organic acts under the auspices of American rule enabled the assimilation of some American constitutional principles. Not least of these is the grant to the executive of the power to pardon. The Constitution of the United States of America includes the grant of the pardoning power in the recital of the President\u2019s powers:Article II, Section 2.The President shall be Commander in Chief of the Army and Navy of the United States, and of the Militia of the several States, when called into the actual Service of the United States; he may require the Opinion, in writing, of the principal Officer in each of the executive Departments, upon any Subject relating to the Duties of their respective Offices, and he shall have Power to grant Reprieves and Pardons for Offences against the United States, except in Cases of Impeachment.. . . .Thus, the Jones Law of 1916 provides:Section 21.-The Governor-General (b) Powers and duties.-. . . . He is hereby vested with the exclusive power to grant pardons and reprieves and remit fines and forfeitures, and may veto any legislation enacted as herein provided. . . .As against the Malolos Constitution, the Jones Law makes no reference to the need for legislative consent, whether a priori or a posteriori, for the exercise of the pardoning power. Equally notable, the pardoning power is mentioned in the same breath (i.e., the same sentence) as the veto power \u2014 a power that delineates the relation of the executive branch with the legislative branch.With the onset of the Commonwealth and en route to independence, the 1935 Constitution affirmed that the power to pardon is executive in nature. Article VII, Section 11(6) of the 1935 Constitution reads:Section 11. . . .(6) The President shall have the power to grant reprieves, commutations, and pardons, and remit fines and forfeitures, after conviction, for all offenses, except in cases of impeachment, upon such conditions and with such restrictions and limitations as he may deem proper to impose. He shall have the power to grant amnesty with the concurrence of the National Assembly.A recollection of the proceedings of the Constitutional Convention reveals attempts \u201cto limit the absolute character of the pardoning power of the Executive:\u201d[121]It was also generally held that, as it was under the Jones Law and in other countries, the pardoning power should be vested in the Executive, although there was a difference of opinion with respect to the authority to exercise the power to grant amnesty. There were many proposals, however, intended to limit the absolute character of the pardoning power of the Executive. Of them were the proposal in the report of the committee on executive power and in the first draft of the Constitution to the effect that pardon should be granted to a person only after his conviction; the Galang amendment embodying a proposal in the report of the committee on executive power to the effect that the Chief Executive could grant pardon to a person only after the latter had served part of the sentence imposed upon him, except in cases where the convicting court should recommend executive clemency, when the same could be exercised even prior to the service of the sentence; and the Sanvictores amendment providing that no pardon should, without the recommendation of the Supreme Court, be granted until the prisoner should have served at least one-half of the minimum sentence imposed.. . . .The Galang amendment and the Sanvictores amendment would go further by requiring that no person, even if already convicted, should be pardoned unless he had served partially his sentence. The Galang amendment would permit executive clemency even before the commencement of the service of the sentence, upon the recommendation of the convicting court; and the Sanvictores amendment, upon the recommendation of the Supreme Court. . . .[122]As will be gleaned from the final text of the 1935 Constitution, the Galang and Sanvictores amendments were both defeated. Thus was affirmed the executive nature of the power to pardon.The 1943 Constitution, adopted in the interlude of the Second World War and the Japanese occupation, echoed the language of the 1935 Constitution on the executive nature of the pardoning power. The text of Article II, Section 13 of the 1943 Constitution is substantially similar with its counterpart in the 1935 Constitution except for the non-mention of impeachment as beyond the coverage of pardoning power:Section 13. The President shall have the power to grant reprieves, commutations and pardons, and remit fines and forfeitures, after conviction, for all offenses, upon such conditions and with such restrictions and limitations as he may deem proper to impose. He shall have the power to grant amnesty with the concurrence of the National Assembly.Like the Jones Law, but unlike the 1935 and 1943 Constitutions, the 1973 Constitution (as amended) dispensed with the requirement of prior conviction. The 1973 Constitution, adopted during the rule of President Ferdinand E. Marcos, is characteristic of a strong executive. Article VII, Section 11 of the 1973 Constitution provides:Section 11. The President may, except in cases of impeachment, grant reprieves, commutations and pardons, remit fines and forfeitures and, with the concurrence of the Batasang Pambansa, grant amnesty.From the grant of the power made by Section 21(b) of the Jones Law of 1916 to the present, the 1987 Constitution, the shifts in the grant to the executive of the power to extend clemency has mainly been in the matter of requiring or dispensing with conviction as a condition precedent for the exercise of executive clemency.The present, the 1987 Constitution, requires prior conviction. Nevertheless, it retains the fundamental regard for the pardoning power as executive in nature. Jurisprudence dating to 1991[123] noted how the 1986 Constitutional Commission rejected a proposal to render the coverage of the pardoning power susceptible to legislative interference, particularly in matters relating to graft and corruption. Likewise, jurisprudence as recent as 2007[124] clarified that a court cannot pre-empt the grant of executive clemency.In addition to restoring the requirement of prior conviction, the 1987 Constitution now includes the phrase \u201cas otherwise provided in this Constitution.\u201dThe 1987 Constitution, in Article VII, Section 19, enumerates the acts or means through which the President may extend clemency: (1) reprieve, or \u201cthe deferment of the implementation of the sentence for an interval of time;\u201d[125] (2) commutation, which \u201crefers to the reduction of the duration of a prison sentence of a prisoner;\u201d[126] (3) remission of fines and forfeitures; (4) pardon; and (5) amnesty.\u201c[P]ardon is of British origin, conceived to temper the gravity of the King's wrath.\u201d[127] It is \"an act of grace, proceeding from the power entrusted with the execution of the laws, which exempts the individual, on whom it is bestowed, from the punishment the law inflicts for a crime he has committed. It is the private, though official act of the executive magistrate, delivered to the individual for whose benefit it is intended, and not communicated officially to the Court. . . . A pardon is a deed, to the validity of which delivery is essential, and delivery is not complete without acceptance.\"[128] (Emphasis supplied)Pardon and amnesty have been distinguished as follows:Pardon is granted by the Chief Executive and as such it is a private act which must be pleaded and proved by the person pardoned, because the courts take no notice thereof; while amnesty by Proclamation of the Chief Executive with the concurrence of Congress, and it is a public act of which the courts should take judicial notice. Pardon is granted to one after conviction; while amnesty is granted to classes of persons or communities who may be guilty of political offenses, generally before or after the institution of the criminal prosecution and sometimes after conviction. Pardon looks forward and relieves the offender form the consequences of an offense of which he has been convicted, that is, it abolishes or forgives the punishment, and for that reason it does \"not work the restoration of the rights to hold public office, or the right of suffrage, unless such rights be expressly restored by the terms of the pardon,\" and it \"in no case exempts the culprit from the payment of the civil indemnity imposed upon him by the sentence\". While amnesty looks backward and abolishes and puts into oblivion the offense with which he is charged that the person released by amnesty stands before the law precisely as though he had committed no offense.[129] (Emphasis supplied, citations omitted)c. Pardon and its effects: forgiveness but not forgetfulness Estrada argues that pardon is characterized by what he refers to as the \u201cforgive-and-forget rule.\u201d[130] He cites several decisions rendered in the United States[131] (chiefly, the 1866, post-Civil War decision in Ex parte Garland) and insists that \u201cpardon not merely releases the offender from the punishment . . . but that it obliterates in legal contemplation the offense itself\u201d[132] and that it \u201cforever closes the eyes of the court.\u201d[133] Citing this court\u2019s decisions in Cristobal v. Labrador[134] and in Pelobello v. Palatino,[135] Estrada asserts that pardon \u201cblots out of existence the guilt, so that in the eye of the law the offender is as innocent as if he had never committed the offence . . . it makes him, as it were, a new man, and gives him new credit and capacity.\u201d[136]Estrada is in grave error for insisting on what he has dubbed as the \u201cforgive-and-forget rule.\u201dIn Monsanto v. Factoran,[137] this court repudiated the pronouncements made by Cristobal and Pelobello, as well as reliance on Garland, on the nature and effects of pardon:In Pelobello v. Palatino, we find a reiteration of the stand consistently adopted by the courts on the various consequences of pardon: \"x x x we adopt the broad view expressed in Cristobal v. Labrador, G.R. No. 47941, December 7, 1940, that subject to the limitations imposed by the Constitution, the pardoning power cannot be restricted or controlled by legislative action; that an absolute pardon not only blots out the crime committed but removes all disabilities resulting from the conviction. x x x (W)e are of the opinion that the better view in the light of the constitutional grant in this jurisdiction is not to unnecessarily restrict or impair the power of the Chief Executive who, after an inquiry into the environmental facts, should be at liberty to atone the rigidity of the law to the extent of relieving completely the party x x x concerned from the accessory and resultant disabilities of criminal conviction.\"The Pelobello v. Palatino and Cristobal v. Labrador cases, and several others show the unmistakable application of the doctrinal case of Ex Parte Garland, whose sweeping generalizations to this day continue to hold sway in our jurisprudence despite the fact that much of its relevance has been downplayed by later American decisions.Consider the following broad statements:\u201cA pardon reaches both the punishment prescribed for the offense and the guilt of the offendor; and when the pardon is full, it releases the punishment and blots out of existence the guilt, so that in the eye of the law the offender is as innocent as if he had never committed the offense. If granted before conviction, it prevents any of the penalties and disabilities, consequent upon conviction, from attaching; if granted after conviction, it removes the penalties and disabilities and restores him to all his civil rights; it makes him, as it were, a new man, and gives him a new credit and capacity.\"Such generalities have not been universally accepted, recognized or approved. The modern trend of authorities now rejects the unduly broad language of the Garland case (reputed to be perhaps the most extreme statement which has been made on the effects of a pardon). To our mind, this [i.e., the rejection of Garland] is the more realistic approach. While a pardon has generally been regarded as blotting out the existence of guilt so that in the eye of the law the offender is as innocent as though he never committed the offense, it does not operate for all purposes. The very essence of a pardon is forgiveness or remission of guilt. Pardon implies guilt. It does not erase the fact of the commission of the crime and the conviction thereof. It does not wash out the moral stain. It involves forgiveness and not forgetfulness.The better considered cases regard full pardon (at least one not based on the offender's innocence) as relieving the party from all the punitive consequences of his criminal act, including the disqualifications or disabilities based on the finding of guilt. But it relieves him from nothing more. \u201cTo say, however, that the offender is a \u2018new man\u2019, and \u2018as innocent as if he had never committed the offense\u2019; is to ignore the difference between the crime and the criminal. A person adjudged guilty of an offense is a convicted criminal, though pardoned; he may be deserving of punishment, though left unpunished; and the law may regard him as more dangerous to society than one never found guilty of crime, though it places no restraints upon him following his conviction.\u201d [138] (Emphasis and underscoring supplied, citations omitted)Estrada has made much of how Monsanto centered on the issue of the need for a new appointment of a pardoned officer seeking to be reinstated to her former position. He posits that Monsanto could not be controlling in this case, as what is at issue here is qualification for elective public office.[139]This is but a vain attempt to split hairs. It is clear from the previously quoted discussion in Monsanto that there was an unequivocal consideration by this court of the nature and effects of pardon. This discussion laid the premises for the ultimate resolution of the dispute and was indispensable to the conclusions this court reached. As against Monsanto, Estrada would have this court rely on a decision, which was rendered nearly a century and a half ago by a court outside of this jurisdiction (i.e., Ex parte Garland), and which, this court has observed to be against the grain of contemporary authorities. In addition, Estrada would have us rely on jurisprudence which themselves depend on the same archaic and foreign decision. To do, as Estrada suggests, would be to indulge an absurdity. Estrada effectively invites this court to irrationality and to arrive at a conclusion resting on premises that have been roundly renounced.In any case, from the preceding discussions, two points are worthy of particular emphasis:Pardon is a private, though official, act of the executive. Proceeding from the power to execute laws, it merely evinces the executive\u2019s choice to decline from enforcing punishment so as to mollify penal misery.Pardon does not erase the moral stain and the fact of conviction. It retains the law\u2019s regard for a convict \u201cas more dangerous to society than one never found guilty of a crime\u201d;[140] the convict remains \u201cdeserving of punishment\u201d though left unpunished.[141]It is with the illumination of this fundamental notion of pardon as a \u2018private act that does not erase the moral stain and the fact of conviction\u2019 that this court must proceed to make a determination of Estrada\u2019s qualification.VIIIThe exercise of pardon:limitations and prescriptionsa. Articles 36 and 41 of the Revised Penal Code do not abridge or diminish the pardoning power of the President Article VII, Section 19 of the 1987 Constitution provides two (2) limitations on the President\u2019s exercise of the power to pardon: first, it can only be given after final conviction; and, second, it cannot be exercised \u201cin cases of impeachment, or as otherwise provided in this Constitution.\u201d Elsewhere in the Constitution, Article IX, C, Section 5 provides that: \u201cNo pardon, amnesty, parole, or suspension of sentence for violation of election laws, rules, and regulations shall be granted by the President without the favorable recommendation of the Commission [on Elections].\u201dOutside of the Constitution, the Revised Penal Code contains provisions relating to pardon.Article 36 of the Revised Penal Code provides that: \u201cA pardon shall in no case exempt the culprit from the payment of the civil indemnity imposed upon him.\u201dThe same Article 36 prescribes that for pardon to effect the restoration of the rights of suffrage and to hold public office, \u201csuch rights [must] be expressly restored by the terms of the pardon.\u201dAlso on suffrage and/or the rights to vote for and be elected to public office, Articles 40 to 43 of the Revised Penal Code provide that the penalties of perpetual absolute disqualification, temporary absolute disqualification, perpetual special disqualification, and perpetual special disqualification on suffrage, which attach as accessory penalties to death, reclusion perpetua, reclusion temporal, prisi\u00f3n mayor and prisi\u00f3n correccional, as the case may be, shall still be suffered by the offender even though pardoned as to the principal penalty, \u201cunless . . . expressly remitted in the pardon\u201d:ARTICLE 40. Death \u2014 Its Accessory Penalties. \u2014 The death penalty, when it is not executed by reason of commutation or pardon shall carry with it that of perpetual absolute disqualification and that of civil interdiction during thirty years following the date of sentence, unless such accessory penalties have been expressly remitted in the pardon.ARTICLE 41. Reclusi\u00f3n Perpetua and Reclusi\u00f3n Temporal \u2014 Their accessory penalties. \u2014 The penalties of reclusi\u00f3n perpetua and reclusi\u00f3n temporal shall carry with them that of civil interdiction for life or during the period of the sentence as the case may be, and that of perpetual absolute disqualification which the offender shall suffer even though pardoned as to the principal penalty, unless the same shall have been expressly remitted in the pardon.ARTICLE 42. Prisi\u00f3n Mayor \u2014 Its Accessory Penalties. \u2014 The penalty of prisi\u00f3n mayor shall carry with it that of temporary absolute disqualification and that of perpetual special disqualification from the right of suffrage which the offender shall suffer although pardoned as to the principal penalty, unless the same shall have been expressly remitted in the pardon.ARTICLE 43. Prisi\u00f3n Correccional \u2014 Its Accessory Penalties. \u2014 The penalty of prisi\u00f3n correccional shall carry with it that of suspension from public office, from the right to follow a profession or calling, and that of perpetual special disqualification from the right of suffrage, if the duration of said imprisonment shall exceed eighteen months. The offender shall suffer the disqualification provided in this article although pardoned as to the principal penalty, unless the same shall have been expressly remitted in the pardon. (Emphasis supplied)Citing the same cases of Cristobal, Pelobello, and Garland, Estrada argues that Articles 36 and 41 of the Revised Penal Code violate the Constitution in requiring that the restoration of the rights of suffrage or to otherwise vote for and be elected to public office must be made expressly. Specifically, he claims that these provisions \u201cabridge or diminish the pardoning power of the President.\u201d[142]This court has previously acknowledged, in Llamas v. Orbos,[143] that the 1986 Constitutional Commission rejected a proposal to include in Article VII, Section 19, a statement to the effect that \"the power to grant executive clemency for violation of corrupt practices laws may be limited by legislation.\" Thus, this court concluded that \u201cthe President's executive clemency powers may not be limited in terms of coverage, except as already provided in the Constitution\u201d:During the deliberations of the Constitutional Commission, a subject of deliberations was the proposed amendment to Art. VII, Sec. 19 which reads as follows: \"However, the power to grant executive clemency for violation of corrupt practices laws may be limited by legislation.\" The Constitutional Commission, however, voted to remove the amendment, since it was in derogation of the powers of the President. As Mr. Natividad stated:\u201cI am also against this provision which will again chip more powers from the President. In case of other criminals convicted in our society we extend probation to them while in this case, they have already been convicted and we offer mercy. The only way we can offer mercy to them is through this executive clemency extended to them by the President. If we still close this avenue to them, they would be prejudiced even worse than the murderers and the more vicious killers in our society. . . .\u201dThe proposal was primarily intended to prevent the President from protecting his cronies. Manifestly, however, the Commission preferred to trust in the discretion of Presidents and refrained from putting additional limitations on his clemency powers. (II RECORD of the Constitutional Commission, 392, 418-419, 524-525)It is evident from the intent of the Constitutional Commission, therefore, that the President's executive clemency powers may not be limited in terms of coverage, except as already provided in the Constitution, that is, \"no pardon, amnesty, parole, or suspension of sentence for violation of election laws, rules and regulations shall be granted by the President without the favorable recommendation of the COMELEC\" (Article IX, C, Section 5, Constitution). If those already adjudged guilty criminally in court may be pardoned, those adjudged guilty administratively should likewise be extended the same benefit.[144]Not only has the coverage of executive clemency been recognized to be beyond the reach of legislative action, this court has also noted that the matter of whether the President should actually choose to extend executive clemency to a convict cannot be preempted by judicial action. Thus, the determination of whether a convict shall be extended clemency is a decision that is solely for the President to make:This Court cannot review, much less preempt, the exercise of executive clemency under the pretext of preventing the accused from evading the penalty of reclusion perpetua or from trifling with our judicial system. Clemency is not a function of the judiciary; it is an executive function. . . .[145]The 1987 Constitution\u2019s recital of the instances when pardon may or may not be exercised and this court\u2019s prior recognition of clemency as an executive function notwithstanding, Articles 36 and 41 of the Revised Penal Code could not be considered as abridging or diminishing the President\u2019s right to extend clemency.To \u201cabridge\u201d or to \u201cdiminish\u201d is to shorten, reduce, or lessen.[146] Further, \u201ccoverage\u201d pertains to scope,[147] it refers to \u201c[t]he extent to which something deals with or applies to something else.\u201d[148]Articles 36 and 41 do not reduce the coverage of the President\u2019s pardoning power. At no point do they say that the President may not grant pardon. They do not recite instances or areas in which the President\u2019s power to pardon is rendered non-existent, or in which the President is otherwise incapable of granting pardon. Articles 36 and 41 notwithstanding, the only instances in which the President may not extend pardon remain to be: (1) impeachment cases; (2) cases that have not yet resulted in a final conviction; and (3) cases involving violations of election laws, rules, and regulations in which there was no favorable recommendation coming from the COMELEC. Stated otherwise, the President remains capacitated to grant a pardon that works to restore the rights of suffrage and/or to hold public office, or to otherwise remit the penalty of perpetual absolute disqualification.Articles 36 and 41 refer only to requirements of convention or form. They only provide a procedural prescription. They are not concerned with areas where or the instances when the President may grant pardon; they are only concerned with how he or she is to exercise such power so that no other governmental instrumentality needs to intervene to give it full effect.All that Articles 36 and 41 do is prescribe that, if the President wishes to include in the pardon the restoration of the rights of suffrage and to hold public office, or the remission of the accessory penalty of perpetual absolute disqualification, he or she should do so expressly. Articles 36 and 41 only ask that the President state his or her intentions clearly, directly, firmly, precisely, and unmistakably. To belabor the point, the President retains the power to make such restoration or remission, subject to a prescription on the manner by which he or she is to state it.This interpretation is consistent with the clear constitutional intention to grant exclusive prerogative to the President to decide when to exercise such power. As in this case, any ambiguity invites judicial intervention.Also, it is a basic precept that \u201cpublic office is a public trust.\u201d[149] In contrast, pardon is a \u201cprivate, though official act of the executive magistrate, delivered to the individual for whose benefit it is intended.\u201d[150] Given the contrasting natures of, on the one hand, elective office as a public trust, and, on the other, pardon as a private act, it \u201cwould not be asking too much\u201d[151] of the President to be unequivocal with his or her intentions on restoring a convict\u2019s right not just to vote, but more so, to be voted for elective public office.Doing so serves not only a practical purpose but, more importantly, the greater public interest in not leaving to inference the qualification of a person who is regarded \u201cas more dangerous to society\u201d[152] but stands to gain from the reposition of public trust.[153] It addresses the \u201cpresumptive rule that one who is rendered infamous by conviction of a felony, or other base offense indicative of moral turpitude, is unfit to hold public office, as the same partakes of a privilege which the State grants only to such classes of persons which are most likely to exercise it for the common good.\u201d[154]Pronouncing in express and unmistakable language the restoration of the right to vote and be voted, therefore, complements the private act of pardoning such that it enables the inclusion of public effects in the private act. It desegregates the public consequence of enabling the convict with the opportunity to lead the community by being the occupant of a public office.Recall that the manner by which the 1987 Constitution phrases its investiture on the President of the pardoning power now includes the phrase \u201cas otherwise provided in this Constitution.\u201d This phrase affirms the imperative of reading and interpreting the Constitution in its entirety, not taking a provision in isolation. The pardoning power of the President must, thus, not be divorced from the Constitution\u2019s injunction that \u201c[p]ublic office is a public trust.\u201d[155] Read in harmony with this injunction, Articles 36 and 41 of the Revised Penal Code impress upon the President the significance of departing from the purely private consequences of pardon should he or she stray into the public affair of restoring a convict\u2019s rights of suffrage and/or to hold public office.Parenthetically, the Constitution also grants this court jurisdiction to determine \u201cwhether or not there has been a grave abuse of discretion amounting to . . . excess of jurisdiction on the part of any branch or instrumentality of the Government.\u201d[156] This means that no grant of constitutional power is immune from review if it is done arbitrarily or without reason, capriciously, or on the basis of whim. However, this court\u2019s power of review in the present case is not raised by any party and, thus, not an issue that this court must decide.(b) Clarifying MonsantoMonsanto, in the course of repudiating Cristobal, Pelobello, and Garland, declared that \u201c[t]he better considered cases regard full pardon . . . as relieving the party from all the punitive consequences of his criminal act, including the disqualifications or disabilities based on the finding of guilt.\u201d[157]This \u201cinclusion\u201d should not be taken as authority for concluding that the grant of pardon ipso facto remits the accessory disqualifications or disabilities imposed on a convict regardless of whether the remission was explicitly stated.For one, this \u201cinclusion\u201d was not a categorical articulation by this court of a prevailing rule. It was a statement made only in the course of a comparative survey of cases during which the court manifested a preference for \u201cauthorities [that reject] the unduly broad language of the Garland case.\u201d[158]Second, the footnote to this statement indicates that it relied on a case decided by a United States court: Comm. of Met. Dist. Com. v. Director of Civil Service.[159] Thus, it was never meant as a summation of the controlling principles in this jurisdiction. It did not account for Articles 36 and 41 of the Revised Penal Code.Lastly, even if it were to be granted that this statement articulated a rule, this statement, made in 1989, must be deemed to have been abandoned, in light of this court\u2019s more recent pronouncements \u2014 in 1997, in People v. Casido,[160] and in 2000, in People v. Patriarca[161] \u2014 which cited with approval this court\u2019s statement in Barrioquinto v. Fernandez[162] that:[p]ardon looks forward and relieves the offender from the consequences of an offense of which he has been convicted, that is, it abolishes or forgives the punishment, and for that reason it does \u2018not work the restoration of the rights to hold public office, or the right of suffrage, unless such rights be expressly restored by the terms of the pardon,\u2019 and it \u2018in no case exempts the culprit from the payment of the civil indemnity imposed upon him by the sentence\u2019.[163] (Emphasis supplied)So, too, this statement indicating \u201cinclusion\u201d must be deemed superseded by this court\u2019s 2013 pronouncement in Romeo Jalosjos v. COMELEC[164] which recognizes that \u201cone who is previously convicted of a crime punishable by reclusion perpetua or reclusion temporal continues to suffer the accessory penalty of perpetual absolute disqualification even though pardoned as to the principal penalty, unless the said accessory penalty shall have been expressly remitted in the pardon.\u201d[165]IXNo remission of the penalty of perpetual absolute disqualification and restoration of the rights to vote and be voted for elective public office in Estrada\u2019s pardonHaving established that the challenge to the validity of Articles 36 and 41 of the Revised Penal Code must fail, we turn to the pivotal issue of whether, in light of these statutory provisions, the pardon granted to Estrada effectively restored his rights to vote and be voted for elective public office, or otherwise remitted his perpetual absolute disqualification.It did not.(a) No express remission and/or restoration; reliance on inference is improper The dispositive portion of the pardon extended by former President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo to Estrada reads:IN VIEW HEREOF and pursuant to the authority conferred upon me by the Constitution, I hereby grant executive clemency to JOSEPH EJERCITO ESTRADA, convicted by the Sandiganbayan of Plunder and imposed a penalty of Reclusion Perpetua. He is hereby restored to his civil and political rights.The forfeitures imposed by the Sandiganbayan remain in force and in full, including all writs and processes issued by the Sandiganbayan in pursuance hereof, except for the bank account(s) he owned before his tenure as President.Upon acceptance of this pardon by JOSEPH EJERCITO ESTRADA, this pardon shall take effect.[166]From the plain text of this disposition, it can be readily seen that there is no categorical statement actually saying that Estrada\u2019s rights to vote and be voted for elective public office are restored, or that the penalty of perpetual absolute disqualification is remitted.The disposition contains three (3) clauses that delimit the effects of the pardon:The general grant of executive clemency to Estrada (i.e., \u201cI hereby grant executive clemency to JOSEPH EJERCITO ESTRADA\u201d);The restoration of Estrada\u2019s civil and political rights (i.e., \u201cHe is hereby restored to his civil and political rights\u201d); andThe continuing validity of the forfeitures imposed by the Sandiganbayan.As a cure for the lack of a categorical statement restoring his rights to vote and be voted for elective public office, or otherwise remitting the penalty of perpetual absolute disqualification, Estrada argues that the rights to vote and be voted for elective public office are political rights; hence, \u201cthe restoration of Estrada\u2019s right to seek public office is deemed subsumed when the pardon extended by GMA expressly restored the civil and political rights of the Public (sic) Respondent.\u201d[167] He asserts that \u201c[s]uch statement is already a substantial if not full compliance with the requirements of Article 36 of the Revised Penal Code.\u201d[168]Estrada\u2019s use of tentative and indefinite language \u2014 such as \u201cdeemed subsumed\u201d and \u201csubstantial compliance\u201d \u2014 reveals his own acknowledgement that the restoration and/or remission, if any, in the pardon are not as unequivocal or as absolutely clear as they could otherwise have been had the pardon simply stated, for instance, that \u201cthe penalty of perpetual absolute disqualification is hereby removed.\u201dEstrada is noticeably compelled to resort to syllogism in order to arrive at the deductive conclusion that he is qualified to run. He rests his position on an inference.This reliance on inference is precisely what the requirement of expressly stating the restoration or remission seeks to avoid. To be \u201cexpress\u201d is to state \u201cdirectly, firmly, and explicitly.\u201d[169] It is synonymous with being precise.[170] On the contrary, to \u201cinfer\u201d is to rely on what is implied; it is to \u201csurmise.\u201d[171] Inference is exactly what relying on an express pronouncement does not entail.(b) Even the inference that Estrada proffers is laden with fallacies In any case, even if Estrada\u2019s inferences and reliance on the characterization of the rights to vote and be voted for elective public office as political rights is to be indulged, it does not follow that these specific rights have been restored by the pardon\u2019s generic restoration of civil and political rights.The concept of \u201ccivil and political rights\u201d both as its own collectivity and in contrast with other classes of human rights emerged in the aftermath of the Second World War. Its conceptual development is more effectively understood in the context of the emergence of the contemporary human rights regime and the efforts at enabling the then nascent United Nations to \u201cassum[e] the role of guarantor of human rights on a universal scale\u201d[172] consistent with the perceived need that \u201cthe individual human being be placed under the protection of the international community.\u201d[173]As Professor Christian Tomuschat discussed in an introductory note to the International Convention on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), the Second World War revealed that \u201cnational governments could gravely fail in their duty to ensure the life and the liberty of their citizens.\u201d[174] Worse, some of these national governments have themselves \u201cbecome murderous institutions.\u201d[175] It was, therefore, evident \u201cthat protective mechanisms at the domestic level alone did not provide sufficiently stable safeguards.\u201d[176]The historical milieu of the efforts taken to enable the United Nations to assume the previously mentioned \u201crole of guarantor of human rights on a universal scale\u201d[177] reveals how \u201ccivil and political rights\u201d as a concept of distinct rights \u2014 embodied in its own instrument \u2014 came to be:At the San Francisco Conference in 1945, some Latin American countries requested that a full code of human rights be included in the Charter of the United Nations itself. Since such an initiative required careful preparation, their motions could not be successful at that stage. Nonetheless, human rights were embraced as a matter of principle. The Charter contains references to human rights in the Preamble, among the purposes of the Organization (Article 1) and in several other provisions (Articles 13, 55, 62 and 68). Immediately after the actual setting up of the institutional machinery provided for by the Charter, the new Commission on Human Rights began its work for the creation of an International Bill of Rights. In a first step, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights was drafted, which the General Assembly adopted on 10 December 1948.In order to make human rights an instrument effectively shaping the lives of individuals and nations, more than just a political proclamation was needed. Hence, from the very outset there was general agreement to the effect that the substance of the Universal Declaration should be translated into the hard legal form of an international treaty. The General Assembly reaffirmed the necessity of complementing, as had already been done in the Universal Declaration, traditional civil and political rights with economic, social and cultural rights, since both classes of rights were \u201cinterconnected and interdependent\u201d (see section E of resolution 421 (V) of 4 December 1950). The only question was whether, following the concept of unity of all human rights, the new conventional rights should be encompassed in one international instrument or whether, on account of their different specificities, they should be arranged according to those specificities. Western nations in particular claimed that the implementation process could not be identical, economic and social rights partaking more of the nature of goals to be attained whereas civil and political rights had to be respected strictly and without any reservations. It is this latter view that eventually prevailed. By resolution 543 (VI) of 4 February 1952, the General Assembly directed the Commission on Human Rights to prepare, instead of just one Covenant, two draft treaties; a Covenant setting forth civil and political rights and a parallel Covenant providing for economic, social and cultural rights. The Commission completed its work in 1954. Yet it took many years before eventually the political climate was ripe for the adoption of these two ambitious texts. While both the Western and the Socialist States were still not fully convinced of their usefulness, it was eventually pressure brought to bear upon them from Third World countries which prompted them to approve the outcome of the protracted negotiating process. Accordingly, on 16 December 1966, the two Covenants were adopted by the General Assembly by consensus, without any abstentions (resolution 2200 (XXI)). Since that time, the two comprehensive human rights instruments of the United Nations have sailed on different courses.[178]Professor Tomuschat further summarizes the provisions of the ICCPR, its manner of recital of civil and political rights, and the common thread binding the rights recited in it:The ICCPR comprises all of the traditional human rights as they are known from historic documents such as the First Ten Amendments to the Constitution of the United States (1789/1791) and the French D\u00e9claration des droits de l\u2019homme et du citoyen (1789). However, in perfect harmony with its sister instrument, Part I starts out with the right of self-determination which is considered to be the foundational stone of all human rights (article 1). Part II (articles 2 to 5) contains a number of general principles that apply across the board, among them in particular the prohibition on discrimination. Part III enunciates an extended list of rights, the first of which being the right to life (article 6). Article 7 establishes a ban on torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, and article 8 declares slavery and forced or compulsory labour unlawful. Well-balanced guarantees of habeas corpus are set forth in article 9, and article 10 establishes the complementary proviso that all persons deprived of their liberty shall be treated with humanity.Freedom of movement, including the freedom to leave any country, has found its regulation in article 12. Aliens, who do not enjoy a stable right of sojourn, must as a minimum be granted due process in case their expulsion is envisaged (article 13). Fair trial, the scope ratione materiae of which is confined to criminal prosecution and to civil suits at law, has its seat in articles 14 and 15. Privacy, the family, the home or the correspondence of a person are placed under the protection of article 17, and the social activities of human beings enjoy the safeguards of article 18 (freedom of thought, conscience and religion), article 19 (freedom of expression), article 21 (freedom of assembly), and article 22 (freedom of association). Going beyond the classic dimension of protection against interference by State authorities, articles 23 and 24 proclaim that the family and the child are entitled to protection by society and the State.Article 25 establishes the right for everyone to take part in the running of the public affairs of his/her country. With this provision, the ICCPR makes clear that State authorities require some sort of democratic legitimacy. Finally, article 27 recognizes an individual right of members of ethnic, religious or linguistic minorities to engage in the cultural activities characteristic of such minorities. No political rights are provided for. Minorities as such have not been endowed with any rights of political autonomy.[179]Consistent with this concept of civil and political rights as a collectivity of \u201ctraditional human rights as they are known from historic documents\u201d[180] is Karal Vasak\u2019s conception[181] of civil and political rights as \u201cfirst-generation human rights.\u201d This is in contrast with economic, social and cultural rights as \u201csecond-generation human rights\u201d and collective-developmental rights as \u201cthird-generation human rights.\u201d Vasak\u2019s conception of three generations of human rights is a deliberate effort to parallel the French Revolution ideals of liberty, equality, and fraternity, with each generation ordinally reflecting the three ideals. Thus, \u201c[f]irst-generation, \u2018civil-political\u2019 rights deal with liberty and participation in political life.\u201d[182]In our jurisprudence, Simon, Jr. v. Commission on Human Rights[183] discussed the concept of human rights as \u201cso generic a term that any attempt to define it . . . could at best be described as inconclusive.\u201d[184] Further, it attempted to define civil rights and political rights as follows:The term \u201ccivil rights,\u201d has been defined as referring \u2013\"(to) those (rights) that belong to every citizen of the state or country, or, in a wider sense, to all its inhabitants, and are not connected with the organization or administration of government. They include the rights of property, marriage, equal protection of the laws, freedom of contract, etc. Or, as otherwise defined civil rights are rights appertaining to a person by virtue of his citizenship in a state or community. Such term may also refer, in its general sense, to rights capable of being enforced or redressed in a civil action.\"Also quite often mentioned are the guarantees against involuntary servitude, religious persecution, unreasonable searches and seizures, and imprisonment for debt.Political rights, on the other hand, are said to refer to the right to participate, directly or indirectly, in the establishment or administration of government, the right of suffrage, the right to hold public office, the right of petition and, in general, the rights appurtenant to citizenship vis-a-vis the management of government.[185] (Citations omitted)The recurring refrain of these discussions \u2014 historical, academic and jurisprudential \u2014 is the understanding that \u201ccivil and political rights\u201d is a collectivity. It is a figurative basket of \u201crights directly possessed by individuals [that are correlatively] positive duties upon the government to respect and fulfil them.\u201d[186] Understood in this context, it is clear that the rights of suffrage and to hold public (elective) office, are but two of a manifold category of rights \u201cdeal[ing] with liberty and participation in political life\u201d[187] and encompassing the entire spectrum of all such \u201crights appurtenant to citizenship vis-\u00e0-vis the management of government.\u201d[188]In light of the circumstances of this case, to speak of \u201crestor[ing] civil and political rights\u201d[189] is to refer to an entire composite of rights. Estrada theorizes that because there was a sweeping reference to this collectivity, then everything in the \u2018basket\u2019 has been restored.Estrada\u2019s theory fails on two points. First, it fails to consider the consequences of statutory requirements which specifically refer to the rights of suffrage and to hold public office. Second, it fails to recognize that the language used in the pardon is equivocal at best, and, worse, the conclusion he derives from this equivocal language is even contradicted by other examples previously considered in jurisprudence. Thus, he insists on a conclusion that does not logically follow from his premises.Estrada capitalizes on the broad conception of civil and political rights as including in its scope the rights of suffrage and the right to hold public office. That is precisely the handicap in his theory: It is broad; it fails to account for requirements relating to specific rights.As against the broad concept of civil and political rights as an expansive composite or a vast spectrum of rights having to do with liberty and membership in the political community, Articles 36 and 41 of the Revised Penal Code specifically deal with the rights of suffrage and to hold public office.Juxtaposed with the manifold category of civil and political rights, the effect of Articles 36 and 41 is that, in the specific context of the President\u2019s exercise of the power to grant pardon to a convict, the rights of suffrage and to hold public office are segregated from all other similar rights.This segregation is not grounded on whim. It hearkens to the fundamental distinction between public office as a public trust, on the one hand, and pardon as a private act, on the other. The special requirement of express restoration or remission affirms what was earlier discussed to be the need to desegregate, or to bridge the disjunct between the private gesture of pardoning \u2014 originally intended only to relieve an individual\u2019s misery over the harshness of punishment \u2014 and the public consequence (no longer connected with the basic purpose of mollifying penal misery) of not only enabling a convict to participate in the selection of public officials, but to himself or herself be a repository of public trust should he or she become a public officer. To reiterate, public office \u201cpartakes of a privilege which the State grants only to such classes of persons which are most likely to exercise it for the common good.\u201d[190]Consistent with the public interest inherent in the rights of suffrage and holding public office, thus, if the President is to not actually say that the rights of suffrage and to hold public office are restored, there is plainly no basis for concluding that they have, in fact, been restored.Such is the situation in this case. At no point does the pardon actually, expressly, categorically, and unmistakably say that Estrada\u2019s rights to suffrage and to hold public office have been restored. That this court \u2014 the Supreme Court of the Republic \u2014 has been asked to step in and settle the controversy is the best proof of this.Apart from these, a meticulous consideration of how the restoration of Estrada\u2019s civil and political rights is worded, especially in contrast with other examples previously considered in jurisprudence, casts serious doubt on whether the restoration was as expansive as Estrada asserts.The exact words of the pardon granted to Estrada are: \u201cHe is hereby restored to his civil and political rights.\u201d[191]In contrast, jurisprudence is replete with pardon, working to restore civil and political rights in this wise: \u201cfull civil and political rights.\u201d[192] A fact noted in one case even seems to indicate that the inclusion of the qualifier \u201cfull\u201d is common practice. In that case, the phrase \u201cfull civil and political rights\u201d was \u201cwritten on a standard printed form.\u201d[193]This is not the occasion to rule on the sufficiency of adding the qualifier \u201cfull\u201d for purposes of restoring even the rights of suffrage and to hold public office. However, burdened with the task of interpretation, particular note should be taken by this court of President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo\u2019s deviation from previous, standard practice.The President must be presumed to be fully cognizant of the significance and consequences of the manner by which he or she executes official acts, as well as the manner by which they are formally reduced to writing. It is revealing that former President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo chose to deviate from many historical examples and from what appears to be common practice. Aware of the significance of excluding the qualifier \u201cfull,\u201d she chose to grant pardon to Estrada under entirely generic and indistinct terms.Similarly, the President must be presumed to be cognizant of statutes and what they require. In granting pardon to Estrada, former President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo must have been fully informed of the requirements of Articles 36 and 41 of the Revised Penal Code if it was ever her intent to restore Estrada\u2019s rights to vote and be voted for elective public office or to otherwise remit the penalty of perpetual absolute disqualification.Not only did former President Arroyo choose to shy away from qualifying the restoration of Estrada\u2019s civil and political rights as \u201cfull.\u201d She also chose, contrary to Articles 36 and 41, to be totally silent on the restoration of the rights to vote and be voted for elective public office and on the remission of the penalty of absolute disqualification. These twin circumstances \u2014 first, of her exclusion of a qualifier and, second, her silence on restoration and remission \u2014 can only mean that contrary to Estrada\u2019s contention, his rights to vote and be voted for elective public office have not been restored, and his perpetual absolute disqualification not remitted.Lest misinterpretation ensue, I am not here giving rise to a false dilemma and rendering inutile the restoration of Estrada\u2019s civil and political rights. Indeed, they have been restored, all but the rights denied to him on account of the unremitted penalty of perpetual absolute disqualification, among these being the rights to vote and be voted for elective public office. That entire spectrum of rights \u201cdeal[ing] with liberty and participation in political life\u201d[194] \u2014 to mention but a few such as his right to liberty; freedom of abode and movement; privacy rights; rights of expression, association, assembly; his right to petition the government and to a redress of grievances \u2014 are his to enjoy except for the select class of rights denied to him on account of the omissions in his pardon.Similarly, my pronouncements should not be taken as rendering illusory the concept of \u201cplenary pardon\u201d \u2014 a concept that, as Estrada pointed out, is recognized in Section 12 of the Omnibus Election Code. The President remains free to grant pardon that works to restore all of a convict\u2019s civil and political rights, even those of suffrage and to hold public office. What I have however emphasized is that, should the President choose to be so expansive in making such a restoration, he or she should be clear with his or her intentions.XThe pardon\u2019s preambular clauses militate against Estrada\u2019s positionApart from the pardon\u2019s absolute silence on the matters of restoration and remission, its preambular or whereas clauses militate against the conclusion that Estrada\u2019s rights to suffrage and to hold public office have been restored.The pardon\u2019s three preambular clauses read:WHEREAS, this Administration has a policy of releasing inmates who have reached the age of seventy (70),WHEREAS, Joseph Ejercito Estrada has been under detention for six and a half years,WHEREAS, Joseph Ejercito Estrada has publicly committed to no longer seek any elective position or office[.][195]A preamble is \u201cnot an essential part of an act.\u201d[196] It is only an introduction which indicates intent or purpose. In and of itself, it cannot be the source of rights and obligations. Thus, \u201c[w]here the meaning of [an instrument] is clear and unambiguous, the preamble can neither expand nor restrict its operation, much less prevail over its text.\"[197] Stated otherwise, it may be resorted to only when the instrument is \u201cambiguous and difficult of interpretation.\u201d[198]In People v. Judge Purisima,[199] this court had occasion to interpret an act of the President (who then held the power to legislate) through a reading of whereas clauses.[200] People v. Judge Purisima concluded, referring to \u201cthe presence of events which led to or precipitated the enactment of P.D. 9\u2026 [as] clearly spelled out in the \u2018Whereas\u2019 clauses,\u2019\u201d[201] that Presidential Decree No. 9 excluded instances where a defendant carried bladed, pointed, or blunt weapons in situations which were not related to the purposes of Proclamation No. 1081 and General Orders Nos. 6 and 7. Further identifying the purposes for the issuance of Proclamation No. 1081, this court also read two of Proclamation No. 1081\u2019s own whereas clauses[202] and concluded that it was aimed at putting an end to subversive activities. Thus, this court concluded that the act of carrying bladed, pointed, or blunt weapons was only punishable to the extent that it was done in the context of subversive activities.Jurisprudence and other official acts of this court are replete with instances in which reference to preambular clauses was resorted to in interpreting instruments other than statutes and official acts of the President. In Licaros v. Gatmaitan,[203] this court sustained the Court of Appeals\u2019 reference to a whereas clause in a contract between private parties (i.e., a memorandum of agreement) and thereby the conclusion that the parties \u201cintended to treat their agreement as one of conventional subrogation.\u201d[204] In Kuwait Airways Corporation v. Philippine Airlines, Inc.,[205] it was impliedly acknowledged that resort to a whereas clause is permissible in interpreting a contract entered into by the government; except that, because the circumstances have changed, it was deemed unnecessary to proceed to an interpretation in light of the relevant whereas clause.[206] In Conte v. Palma,[207] this court referred to whereas clauses in interpreting a resolution issued by the Social Security System.[208] Similarly, this court\u2019s En Banc resolution in A.M. No. 99-8-01-SC,[209] issued by this court in the exercise of its rule-making power, cited a statute\u2019s[210] whereas clause.The pardon extended to Estrada is definite by its omission: There is neither an express restoration of Estrada\u2019s rights to vote and be voted for elective public office nor a remission of his perpetual absolute disqualification. To this extent, it is clear and unambiguous. This should suffice to put an end to Estrada\u2019s asseverations that he was qualified to run for Mayor of Manila.Nevertheless, even if the position that there remains room for interpretation was to be indulged, a reading of the pardon as a whole, and an illumination, through the preambular clauses, of the pardon\u2019s supposed ambiguity, will lead to the same conclusion: Estrada was and remains to be disqualified.As in Purisima, the pardon\u2019s whereas clauses indicate events and considerations that precipitated or led to the grant of pardon. More specifically, the third whereas clause reveals that the pardon was premised on Estrada\u2019s prior, public commitment of disabling himself from being a candidate in an election (i.e., \u201cto no longer seek any elective position or office\u201d).[211]The preceding discussions underscored the nature of the power to pardon (in particular, and to extend clemency, in general) as being fundamentally a matter of executive discretion. However, that this is a matter resting on the President\u2019s prerogative is no license for the President to heedlessly brandish it. As with all other powers vested in the executive, it is a power that is not to be abused. It cannot be exercised arbitrarily, whimsically, or capriciously. The President may well be a despot, otherwise.Thus, if the power to pardon were ever to be invoked, it must remain true to its reason for existence: to correct \u201cinfirmities, deficiencies or flaws in the administration of justice;\u201d[212] to \u201cmitigat[e] whatever harshness might be generated by a too strict an application of the law[;]\u201d[213] or to otherwise \u201ctemper the gravity of [a punishment\u2019s] wrath.\u201d[214] To the extent, therefore, that the power to pardon is exercised in a manner that evinces nothing more than the indulgence of caprices, an issue that may properly be taken cognizance of by this court arises: grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction.In stating this, I remain mindful of this court\u2019s pronouncement in 2007 in People v. Rocha,[215] which I have cited earlier. At initial glance, Rocha appears to totally erode the power of judicial review in relation to the grant of executive clemency:This Court cannot review, much less preempt, the exercise of executive clemency under the pretext of preventing the accused from evading the penalty of reclusion perpetua or from trifling with our judicial system. Clemency is not a function of the judiciary; it is an executive function. Thus, it is the President, not the judiciary, who should exercise caution and utmost circumspection in the exercise of executive clemency in order to prevent a derision of the criminal justice system. We cannot and shall not deny accused-appellants\u2019 Motions to Withdraw Appeal just because of their intention of applying for executive clemency. With the Constitution bestowing upon the Executive the power to grant clemency, it behoves the Court to pass the ball to the President and let her determine the fate of accused-appellants.[216]However, a meticulous reading of Rocha reveals that its pronouncements were made in a very specific context, i.e., the issue of whether this court should allow the withdrawal of the appeals of accused-appellants in order that they may avail themselves of executive clemency. In making the quoted pronouncement, this court merely affirmed the basic precept that the power to extend clemency is a choice for the President \u2014 and not for any other institution, such as this court \u2014 to make. Thus, it would be improper for this court to take any action that would effectively prevent the President from even making that choice.Rocha was a deferential statement that recognized where the power to extend clemency was lodged. It was a recognition that this court could not preempt the grant of clemency. At no point, however, did Rocha sanction the fanciful exercise of the power. Nowhere did it say that the power granted to the President may be divorced from its raison d\u2019 etre.While it behooves this court to extend to the President the presumption that the grant is attended with good reason, so, too, this court should not indulge a patently frivolous exercise of presidential discretion.Presently, this court finds itself grappling with pardon extended to a deposed President of the Republic who was convicted for the crime of plunder.Joseph Ejercito Estrada is no common convict. In him was reposed the trust of an overwhelming number of Filipinos. He was elected to nothing less than the highest office of the land. Assuming the presidency, he swore, invoking the name of God, to \u201cfaithfully and conscientiously fulfil [his] duties as President[; to] preserve and defend [the] Constitution[;] and [to] consecrate [himself] to the service of the Nation.\u201d[217] This notwithstanding, he is a man, who, tormented with recriminations of massive corruption and failing to exculpate himself in the eyes of the Filipino people, was left with no recourse but to leave the Presidency. He stood trial for and was convicted of plunder: a conviction that endures and stands unreversed.A ruling on this petition cannot be bereft of context, both of the present and of our history. Similarly, this court cannot turn a blind eye on its own recognition of the gravity and grievousness that Estrada\u2019s conviction for plunder entails.In 2001, in Estrada v. Sandiganbayan,[218] this court, against the asseverations of Estrada himself, ruled that plunder is inherently immoral, i.e., malum in se. In so doing, this court, quoting the concurring opinion of Justice Vicente V. Mendoza, emphasized that any doubt on the inherent immorality of plunder \u201cmust be deemed to have been resolved in the affirmative by the decision of Congress in 1993 to include it among the heinous crimes punishable by reclusion perpetua to death.\u201d[219] Estrada v. Sandiganbayan, quoting People v. Echegaray,[220] unequivocally underscored the abhorrence that animates the classification of plunder as a heinous crime punishable by death. This court did not mince words:There are crimes, however, in which the abomination lies in the significance and implications of the subject criminal acts in the scheme of the larger socio-political and economic context in which the state finds itself to be struggling to develop and provide for its poor and underprivileged masses. Reeling from decades of corrupt tyrannical rule that bankrupted the government and impoverished the population, the Philippine Government must muster the political will to dismantle the culture of corruption, dishonesty, greed and syndicated criminality that so deeply entrenched itself in the structures of society and the psyche of the populace. [With the government] terribly lacking the money to provide even the most basic services to its people, any form of misappropriation or misapplication of government funds translates to an actual threat to the very existence of government, and in turn, the very survival of the people it governs over. Viewed in this context, no less heinous are the effects and repercussions of crimes like qualified bribery, destructive arson resulting in death, and drug offenses involving government officials, employees or officers, that their perpetrators must not be allowed to cause further destruction and damage to society.[221] (Emphasis supplied)Turning its attention specifically to Republic Act No. 7080, the Anti-Plunder Law, Estrada v. Sandiganbayan stated:Our nation has been racked by scandals of corruption and obscene profligacy of officials in high places which have shaken its very foundation. The anatomy of graft and corruption has become more elaborate in the corridors of time as unscrupulous people relentlessly contrive more and more ingenious ways to bilk the coffers of the government. Drastic and radical measures are imperative to fight the increasingly sophisticated, extraordinarily methodical and economically catastrophic looting of the national treasury. Such is the Plunder Law, especially designed to disentangle those ghastly tissues of grand-scale corruption which, if left unchecked, will spread like a malignant tumor and ultimately consume the moral and institutional fiber of our nation. The Plunder Law, indeed, is a living testament to the will of the legislature to ultimately eradicate this scourge and thus secure society against the avarice and other venalities in public office.[222] (Emphasis supplied)Section 2 of Republic Act No. 7080, as amended, provides for the definition of and penalties for plunder, as follows:Section 2. Definition of the Crime of Plunder; Penalties. \u2014 Any public officer who, by himself or in connivance with members of his family, relatives by affinity or consanguinity, business associates, subordinates or other persons, amasses, accumulates or acquires ill-gotten wealth through a combination or series of overt or criminal acts as described in Section 1(d) hereof in the aggregate amount or total value of at least Fifty million pesos (P50,000,000.00) shall be guilty of the crime of plunder and shall be punished by reclusion perpetua to death. Any person who participated with the said public officer in the commission of an offense contributing to the crime of plunder shall likewise be punished for such offense. In the imposition of penalties, the degree of participation and the attendance of mitigating and extenuating circumstances, as provided by the Revised Penal Code, shall be considered by the court. The court shall declare any and all ill-gotten wealth and their interests and other incomes and assets including the properties and shares of stocks derived from the deposit or investment thereof forfeited in favor of the State.This technical-legal definition notwithstanding, in common understanding, to plunder is to pillage or to ransack. It denotes more than wrongful taking as to amount to common larceny. Synonymous with despoiling and marauding, plundering evokes the devastation wrought by hordes laying waste to an enemy.[223] By plundering, a subjugator impresses the fact of its having vanquished another by arrogating unto itself the spoils of conquest and rendering more ignominious an otherwise simple defeat.Plundering as a crime and by its scale, therefore, entails more than greed and covetousness. It conjures the image of a public officer deluded in the thought that he or she is some overlord, free to ravage and entitled to seize all that his or her realm can provide. It entails more than ordinary moral turpitude (i.e., an inherently immoral act)[224] as acts like theft, robbery, bribery, profiteering, estafa, extortion, and embezzlement have been categorized.[225] It evinces such a degree of depravity and debasement so heinous that, were it not for the subsequent enactment of a statute (i.e., Republic Act No. 9346), it would remain punishable by death.Recognition must be given to the legislative wisdom underlying the choice of penalty. This is not only with respect to the severity of punishment chosen (i.e., deprivation of life or deprivation of liberty for the longest duration contemplated by the scale of penalties under the Revised Penal Code) but similarly with all other accessories that the penalties of reclusion perpetua and/or death entail. Congress, in choosing to penalize plunder with reclusion perpetua to death, must certainly have been cognizant of how these penalties did not only entail the deprivation of the right to life and/or liberty, but also of how, consistent with Articles 40 and 41 of the Revised Penal Code, they carried the accessory penalty of perpetual absolute disqualification.To recognize this legislative wisdom is, thus, to recognize that penalizing plunder inherently entails the exclusion of a convict from elective exercises for public office, both as a candidate and as a voter, as well as from offices and public employments. This is consistent with the recognition that plunder is an \u201cabomination . . . in the scheme of the larger socio-political and economic context.\u201d[226] Through the penalty of perpetual absolute disqualification, it is, thus, ensured that a person convicted of plunder will no longer find himself or herself in the same setting, i.e., holding (elective) public office, which, in the first place, enabled the commission of plunder.It is against this backdrop of plunder as a social \u201cabomination\u201d[227] as well as \u201ccorruption and obscene profligacy of officials in high places\u201d[228] that Estrada insists on a pardon that worked to restore his rights to vote and be voted for elective public office. Bereft of any clue as to the intent behind the grant of pardon, such grant is mind-boggling. It, and its statement that Estrada is restored to his civil and political rights, appear to defy the disdain which animates the policy against plunder.To reiterate, however, a President\u2019s grant of pardon must be presumed to be grounded on the basic nature of pardon as a means for tempering the harshness of punishment. A reading of the preamble or whereas clauses of the pardon granted to Estrada will reveal that, indeed, the pardon was animated by nothing more than a desire to salve Estrada\u2019s suffering.Consider the recognition made in the first and second preambular clauses that Estrada was already more than 70 years old and had been in detention for about six and a half years. These preambular clauses provide context to why President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo saw wisdom in tempering Estrada\u2019s suffering: Keeping in prison a septuagenarian \u2014 a man who could well be considered to be in the twilight years of his life \u2014 may be too severe; anyway, Estrada had already been deprived of liberty for a considerable length of time.The third preambular clause is even more revealing. It unveils the undertaking made by Estrada (acknowledged and unchallenged by him through his unqualified handwritten acceptance) that he would no longer embark on the very same affair, i.e., (elective) public office, that facilitated his commission of plunder. The inclusion of the third preambular clause is not empty rhetoric. It is an indispensable qualifier indicating that Estrada was pardoned precisely in view of his promise to no longer seek (elective) public office. Similarly, it establishes that the grant of pardon notwithstanding, there is no betrayal of the fundamental policy of aversion against plunder as an affront to \u201cthe larger socio-political and economic context.\u201d[229]Accordingly, any reading of the phrase on which Estrada capitalizes \u2014 \u201c[h]e is hereby restored to his civil and political rights\u201d \u2014 must be made in accordance with the qualifier evinced by an undertaking Estrada himself made \u201cto no longer seek any elective position or office.\u201d[230] Read as such, the pardon could not have possibly worked to reverse the effects of the penalty of perpetual absolute disqualification or to otherwise restore his right to vote in any election for any popular elective office or to be elected to such office.XIEstrada\u2019s re-incarceration is not a proper issue in this case.Drawing attention to Estrada\u2019s undertaking, Risos-Vidal theorizes that Estrada was granted a conditional pardon, i.e, that it was laden with a resolutory condition and that, as Estrada reneged on his undertaking, the rights vested by the pardon must be deemed extinguished. Citing Article 159 of the Revised Penal Code, Risos-Vidal, thus, suggests that Estrada should once again be incarcerated:Thus, clearly, when Joseph Estrada himself intentionally and wilfully breached his pardon when he filed his certificate of candidacy for the position of Mayor of the City of Manila, he is guilty of breach of the conditions of the pardon which puts and [sic] end to the pardon itself and thereby immediately restoring the terms of conviction imposed by the Sandiganbayan. He should therefore be recommitted to prisi\u00f3n consistent with Article 159 of the Revised Penal Code which provides:ART. 159. Other Cases of Evasion of Service of Sentence. \u2014 The penalty of prisi\u00f3n correccional in its minimum period shall be imposed upon the convict who, having been granted conditional pardon by the Chief Executive, shall violate any of the conditions of such pardon. However, if the penalty remitted by the granting of such pardon be higher than six years, the convict shall then suffer the unexpired portion of his original sentence.[231]Estrada counters that he was \u201cgranted an absolute pardon and thereby restored to his full civil and political rights, including the right to seek public elective [sic] office.\u201d[232] Estrada, therefore, construes an \u201cabsolute pardon\u201d as one with sweeping, all-encompassing effects.As against the pardon\u2019s premise of Estrada\u2019s commitment to no longer seek any elective position or office is Estrada\u2019s acceptance:Received & acceptedJoseph E. Estrada (sgd.)DATE: 26 Oct. \u201807TIME: 3:35 P.M.[233]Made in Estrada\u2019s own handwriting, the acceptance articulates no qualification or reservation. Hence, it is an acceptance that is inclusive of his promise to no longer seek elective public office.Nevertheless, the matter of Estrada\u2019s re-incarceration as a possible consequence of the occurrence of a resolutory condition is no longer essential to the disposition of this case. After all, this case pertains to a petition for disqualification. What this court is called upon to rule on is Estrada\u2019s qualification to run for Mayor of Manila.In the limited context that excludes the question of Estrada\u2019s possible re-incarceration, the materiality of his acceptance is in how such acceptance was imperative in order to bring the pardon to effect. As noted in Monsanto, \u201c[a] pardon is a deed, to the validity of which delivery is essential, and delivery is not complete without acceptance.\"[234] This, too, is reflected in the pardon\u2019s text, the last paragraph of which reads:Upon acceptance of this pardon by JOSEPH EJERCITO ESTRADA, this pardon shall take effect.[235] XIIEstrada\u2019s disqualification not affected by the lapse of more than two years since his release from prisonHaving settled on Estrada\u2019s disqualification, it is worth emphasizing (in the interest of settling whatever lingering doubts there may be) that his disqualification is not negated by the statement in Section 40(a) of the Local Government Code that the disqualification relating to \u201c[t]hose sentenced by final judgment for an offense involving moral turpitude or for an offense punishable by one (1) year or more of imprisonment\u201d shall last for \u201ctwo (2) years after serving sentence.\u201d This, even if Section 40 of the Local Government Code is the specific ground relied upon by Risos-Vidal in seeking to disqualify Estrada.The relation between Article 30 of the Revised Penal Code \u2014 on the effects of perpetual absolute disqualification \u2014 and Section 40(a) of the Local Government Code was extensively discussed in Romeo Jalosjos v. COMELEC:[236]Well-established is the rule that every new statute should be construed in connection with those already existing in relation to the same subject matter and all should be made to harmonize and stand together, if they can be done by any fair and reasonable interpretation.. . . .Keeping with the above-mentioned statutory construction principle, the Court observes that the conflict between these provisions of law may be properly reconciled. In particular, while Section 40(a) of the LGC allows a prior convict to run for local elective office after the lapse of two (2) years from the time he serves his sentence, the said provision should not be deemed to cover cases wherein the law imposes a penalty, either as principal or accessory, which has the effect of disqualifying the convict to run for elective office. An example of this would be Article 41 of the RPC, which imposes the penalty of perpetual absolute disqualification as an accessory to the principal penalties of reclusion perpetua and reclusion temporal[.]. . . .Pertinently, it is observed that the import of Article 41 in relation to Article 30 of the RPC is more direct and specific in nature \u2013 insofar as it deprives the candidate to run for elective office due to his conviction \u2013 as compared to Section 40(a) of the LGC which broadly speaks of offenses involving moral turpitude and those punishable by one (1) year or more of imprisonment without any consideration of certain disqualifying effects to one\u2019s right to suffrage. Accordingly, Section 40(a) of the LGC should be considered as a law of general application and therefore, must yield to the more definitive RPC provisions in line with the principle of lex specialis derogat generali \u2013 general legislation must give way to special legislation on the same subject, and generally is so interpreted as to embrace only cases in which the special provisions are not applicable. In other words, where two statutes are of equal theoretical application to a particular case, the one specially designed therefor should prevail.In the present case, petitioner was sentenced to suffer the principal penalties of reclusion perpetua and reclusion temporal which, pursuant to Article 41 of the RPC, carried with it the accessory penalty of perpetual absolute disqualification and in turn, pursuant to Article 30 of the RPC, disqualified him to run for elective office. As discussed, Section 40(a) of the LGC would not apply to cases wherein a penal provision \u2013 such as Article 41 in this case \u2013 directly and specifically prohibits the convict from running for elective office. Hence, despite the lapse of two (2) years from petitioner\u2019s service of his commuted prison term, he remains bound to suffer the accessory penalty of perpetual absolute disqualification which consequently, disqualifies him to run as mayor for Zamboanga City.Notably, Article 41 of the RPC expressly states that one who is previously convicted of a crime punishable by reclusion perpetua or reclusion temporal continues to suffer the accessory penalty of perpetual absolute disqualification even though pardoned as to the principal penalty, unless the said accessory penalty shall have been expressly remitted in the pardon. In this case, the same accessory penalty had not been expressly remitted in the Order of Commutation or by any subsequent pardon and as such, petitioner\u2019s disqualification to run for elective office is deemed to subsist.[237] (Emphasis supplied, citations omitted)Similarly, in this case, it is of no consequence that, by the time Estrada filed his candidacy and sought election as Mayor of the City of Manila, more than (2) years had lapsed since he was released from incarceration following President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo\u2019s grant, and his acceptance, of pardon.In sum, Estrada was disqualified to run for Mayor of the City of Manila in the May 13, 2013 elections. Moreover, his perpetual absolute disqualification not having been remitted, and his rights to vote and be voted for elective public office not having been restored, Estrada remains bound to suffer the effects of the penalty of perpetual absolute disqualification, as listed in Article 30 of the Revised Penal Code. Specifically, he remains disqualified from exercising the right to vote in any election for any popular elective office, and he remains barred from occupying any public office, elective, or otherwise.XIIIOn the supposed disenfranchisement of voters and disregard of the sovereign willEstrada warns against the \u201cmassive disenfranchisement of votes [sic]\u201d[238] and cautions against disrespecting \u201cthe sovereign will of the people as expressed through the ballot.\u201d[239] In doing so, he makes much of the margin of more than 35,000 votes by which he edged out Lim.[240]Estrada is very loosely invoking the concept of a \u201csovereign\u201d as though a plurality of votes is the sole determinant of the \u201csovereign will.\u201dIn the first place, what is involved here is merely an election for a local elective position. Certainly, the voters of a single local government unit ought not to be equated with the \u201csovereign Filipino people.\u201d So blithely is Estrada celebrating his 349,770 votes, he seems to forget that Lim was not even too far off with 313,764 votes.Estrada celebrates the casting of votes in his favor as a seemingly indubitable expression of the sovereign will in trusting him with elective public office. He forgets that a mere three years prior, the voters, not just of the City of Manila, but of the entire Republic, repudiated him and rejected his attempt to once again secure the Presidency. He placed a distant second, behind by more than 5.72 million votes, to President Benigno Simeon Aquino III.Estrada did secure more votes than Lim, that much can be conceded; but these votes were cast in favor of an ineligible candidate, i.e., one who was no candidate at all.The matter of eligibility relates to circumstances personally pertaining to a candidate, e.g., citizenship, residency, age, lack of a prior conviction, and literacy. No amount of votes can cure a candidate\u2019s ineligibility. It could not, for instance, turn a 34-year-old person who filed a certificate of candidacy for Senator into a 35-year-old and suddenly qualify that person for election as a Senator. The matter of qualification is entirely beyond the mere plurality of votes.In the context of constitutional democracy, the sovereign will is as effectively expressed in the official acts of public institutions. The Filipino people speak as much through the laws enacted by their elected representatives as they do through the ballot. Among these laws are those which prescribe the qualifications for elective public offices. Thus, by these requirements, the sovereign Filipino people delimit those who may be elected to public office. Among these, too, is the Revised Penal Code, Articles 36 and 41 of which require the express restoration of the rights of suffrage and to hold public office, or otherwise the express remission of the penalty of perpetual absolute disqualification. So too, the Filipino people speak through the Constitution they have adopted, a basic precept of which is that public office is a public trust. Thus, matters relating to public office cannot be expediently dispensed with through the private act of granting pardon unless such grant be in compliance with legally established requisites.The plurality of voters in Manila may appear to have decided contrary to what is expressed in our laws, but this cannot trump the sovereign will as expressed in our Constitution and laws.XIVPetitioner-intervenor Alfredo S. Lim is the qualified candidate who obtained the highest number of votes in the election for Mayor of the City of ManilaHaving settled that Estrada suffered and continues to suffer from perpetual absolute disqualification, it is proper to resolve the resultant issue of who must be named Mayor of the City of Manila in lieu of Estrada.In this court\u2019s April 16, 2013 decision in Maquiling v. COMELEC,[241] we revisited the 1912 case of Topacio v. Paredes[242] from which originated the often-quoted phrase \u201cthe wreath of victory cannot be transferred from an ineligible candidate to any other candidate when the sole question is the eligibility of the one receiving a plurality of the legally cast ballots.\u201d[243] This was the progenitor of the principle that a supposed second-placer cannot be proclaimed the winner in an election contest.As in the present case, Maquiling involved a petition for disqualification[244] anchored on Section 40 of the Local Government Code.[245] Thus, the principles laid down by Maquiling as to who must occupy an elective position following the determination that a candidate was disqualified are squarely applicable in this case.As explained in Maquiling, the \u2018often-quoted phrase\u2019 from Topacio was a mere obiter dictum:This phrase is not even the ratio decidendi; it is a mere obiter dictum. The Court was comparing \u201cthe effect of a decision that a candidate is not entitled to the office because of fraud or irregularities in the elections x x x [with] that produced by declaring a person ineligible to hold such an office.\u201dThe complete sentence where the phrase is found is part of a comparison and contrast between the two situations, thus:Again, the effect of a decision that a candidate is not entitled to the office because of fraud or irregularities in the elections is quite different from that produced by declaring a person ineligible to hold such an office. In the former case the court, after an examination of the ballots may find that some other person than the candidate declared to have received a plura[l]ity by the board of canvassers actually received the greater number of votes, in which case the court issues its mandamus to the board of canvassers to correct the returns accordingly; or it may find that the manner of holding the election and the returns are so tainted with fraud or illegality that it cannot be determined who received a [plurality] of the legally cast ballots. In the latter case, no question as to the correctness of the returns or the manner of casting and counting the ballots is before the deciding power, and generally the only result can be that the election fails entirely. In the former, we have a contest in the strict sense of the word, because of the opposing parties are striving for supremacy. If it be found that the successful candidate (according to the board of canvassers) obtained a plurality in an illegal manner, and that another candidate was the real victor, the former must retire in favor of the latter. In the other case, there is not, strictly speaking, a contest, as the wreath of victory cannot be transferred from an ineligible candidate to any other candidate when the sole question is the eligibility of the one receiving a plurality of the legally cast ballots. In the one case the question is as to who received a plurality of the legally cast ballots; in the other, the question is confined to the personal character and circumstances of a single individual.Note that the sentence where the phrase is found starts with \u201cIn the other case, there is not, strictly speaking, a contest\u201d in contrast to the earlier statement, \u201cIn the former, we have a contest in the strict sense of the word, because of the opposing parties are striving for supremacy.\u201dThe Court in Topacio v. Paredes cannot be said to have held that \u201cthe wreath of victory cannot be transferred from an ineligible candidate to any other candidate when the sole question is the eligibility of the one receiving a plurality of the legally cast ballots.\u201dA proper reading of the case reveals that the ruling therein is that since the Court of First Instance is without jurisdiction to try a disqualification case based on the eligibility of the person who obtained the highest number of votes in the election, its jurisdiction being confined \u201cto determine which of the contestants has been duly elected\u201d the judge exceeded his jurisdiction when he \u201cdeclared that no one had been legally elected president of the municipality of Imus at the general election held in that town on 4 June 1912\u201d where \u201cthe only question raised was whether or not Topacio was eligible to be elected and to hold the office of municipal president.\u201dThe Court did not rule that Topacio was disqualified and that Abad as the second placer cannot be proclaimed in his stead. . . .[246] (Citations omitted)By definition, an ineligible individual is not even a candidate in the first place.[247] It is, therefore, erroneous to refer to him or her as a \u201cwinner,\u201d that is, as the \u201cwinning candidate,\u201d should he or she obtain the plurality of votes. Consequently, it is illogical to refer to the candidates who are trailing in the vote count as \u201closers,\u201d which is what labels like \u201csecond-placer\u201d entail. As his or her ineligibility as a candidate remains, the number of votes cast for him or her is ultimately not decisive of who must be proclaimed as winner:[248]The ballot cannot override the constitutional and statutory requirements for qualifications and disqualifications of candidates. When the law requires certain qualifications to be possessed or that certain disqualifications be not possessed by persons desiring to serve as elective public officials, those qualifications must be met before one even becomes a candidate. When a person who is not qualified is voted for and eventually garners the highest number of votes, even the will of the electorate expressed through the ballot cannot cure the defect in the qualifications of the candidate. To rule otherwise is to trample upon and rent asunder the very law that sets forth the qualifications and disqualifications of candidates. We might as well write off our election laws if the voice of the electorate is the sole determinant of who should be proclaimed worthy to occupy elective positions in our republic.[249]To rule as such is not tantamount to disrespecting the will of the electorate. As was very recently said in Hayudini v. COMELEC:[250][T]he will of the electorate is still actually respected even when the votes for the ineligible candidate are disregarded. The votes cast in favor of the ineligible candidate are not considered at all in determining the winner of an election for these do not constitute the sole and total expression of the sovereign voice. On the other hand, those votes for the eligible and legitimate candidates form an integral part of said voice, which must equally be given due respect, if not more.[251]Contemporary jurisprudence has seen the repudiation of the position that a \u201csecond-placer\u201d cannot be proclaimed a winner in lieu of an ineligible candidate.This court\u2019s 2012 decisions in Aratea v. COMELEC[252] and Dominador Jalosjos, Jr. v. COMELEC[253] ruled that a certificate of candidacy that was cancelled for being void ab initio, it having been filed by a candidate who falsely claimed that he was eligible, produces no effect, it \u201ccannot give rise to a valid candidacy, and much less to valid votes.\u201d[254] Thus, the votes cast for the ineligible candidate should be considered \u201cstray votes and should not be counted.\u201d[255]This court\u2019s June 25, 2013 resolution in Svetlana Jalosjos v. COMELEC[256] expounded on the reasons for enabling the qualified candidate (the erstwhile \u201csecond-placer, unless of course, he is himself ineligible) who obtained the highest number of votes to assume the contested office. It has also clarified the proper operation of Section 44 of the Local Government Code on the rules on succession in case of a permanent vacancy in the Office of the Mayor:There is another more compelling reason why the eligible candidate who garnered the highest number of votes must assume the office. The ineligible candidate who was proclaimed and who already assumed office is a de facto officer by virtue of the ineligibility.The rule on succession in Section 44 of the Local Government Code cannot apply in instances when a de facto officer is ousted from office and the de jure officer takes over. The ouster of a de facto officer cannot create a permanent vacancy as contemplated in the Local Government Code. There is no vacancy to speak of as the de jure officer, the rightful winner in the elections, has the legal right to assume the position.[257]Dominador Jalosjos, Jr. has not only ruled that the votes for an ineligible candidate are stray votes. It has also impressed upon the COMELEC that it is duty-bound to \u201cmotu proprio bar from running for public office those suffering from perpetual special disqualification by virtue of a final judgment.\u201d[258]Even without a petition under either Section 12 or Section 78 of the Omnibus Election Code, or under Section 40 of the Local Government Code, the COMELEC is under a legal duty to cancel the certificate of candidacy of anyone suffering from the accessory penalty of perpetual special disqualification to run for public office by virtue of a final judgment of conviction. The final judgment of conviction is notice to the COMELEC of the disqualification of the convict from running for public office. The law itself bars the convict from running for public office, and the disqualification is part of the final judgment of conviction. The final judgment of the court is addressed not only to the Executive branch, but also to other government agencies tasked to implement the final judgment under the law.Whether or not the COMELEC is expressly mentioned in the judgment to implement the disqualification, it is assumed that the portion of the final judgment on disqualification to run for elective public office is addressed to the COMELEC because under the Constitution the COMELEC is duty bound to \u201c[e]nforce and administer all laws and regulations relative to the conduct of an election.\u201d The disqualification of a convict to run for public office under the Revised Penal Code, as affirmed by final judgment of a competent court, is part of the enforcement and administration of \u201call laws\u201d relating to the conduct of elections.To allow the COMELEC to wait for a person to file a petition to cancel the certificate of candidacy of one suffering from perpetual special disqualification will result in the anomaly that these cases so grotesquely exemplify. Despite a prior perpetual special disqualification, Jalosjos was elected and served twice as mayor. The COMELEC will be grossly remiss in its constitutional duty to \"enforce and administer all laws\" relating to the conduct of elections if it does not motu proprio bar from running for public office those suffering from perpetual special disqualification by virtue of a final judgment.[259]Applying these principles, the votes cast for private respondent Joseph Ejercito Estrada, a disqualified and ineligible candidate, must be held as stray votes. Petitioner-intervenor Alfredo S. Lim is the qualified candidate who obtained the highest number of votes in the contest to be elected Mayor of the City of Manila in the May 13, 2013 elections. Accordingly, he must be proclaimed the duly elected Mayor of the City of Manila, lest there be grounds, not contemplated in this opinion, barring his proclamation.Final noteNot so long ago, our people were moved by revelations of wrongdoing committed by one who temporarily occupied one of the most important public offices of our society \u2014 the Presidency. Our people\u2019s collective voices uttered in private conversations avalanched into a people\u2019s movement. This voice found its way into the halls of the House of Representatives and the Senate in a historic impeachment proceeding. Events unravelled, which caused the offending President to vacate Malaca\u00f1ang, to be considered resigned, and to finally be replaced.His prosecution subsequently ensued. A first in our history, the Sandiganbayan found him guilty of committing the highest possible crime attended by graft and corruption. This betrayal of the public trust is called plunder. It is statutorily punished by a penalty of reclusion perpetua and permanent disqualification from public office.The person convicted of plunder now walks free among us. He did not spend a single day in an ordinary jail. There is no question that he was pardoned. Today, the majority completes the circle by reading an ambiguous pardon allowing him yet again to run for public office. The majority uses the equivocal silence of the succeeding President who devised the ambiguous pardon as one of the bases to say that the convicted former President can again seek public office.This is template for our political elite at the expense of the masses who toil and suffer from the consequences of corruption. It is hope for those who occupy high government offices who commit crimes as they await a next political term when the people\u2019s vigilance would have waned. It is the denouement in a narrative that will explain why there is no effective deterrent to corruption in high places. The pragmatism of politics takes over the highest notion that public office should be of effective public trust. The rule of law should unravel to meet this expectation.The pardon was ambiguous. By our laws and constitutional fiat, it should have been read as perpetually prohibiting he who was convicted of plunder from again occupying any public office. This is my reading of what the values in our laws require.I do not judge respondent for who he is as a person. That is not within our constitutional competence. But as a leader, the respondent will best show that the way forward for the country he loves should be for him to repent and for him to suffer courageously the consequences of his past acts. There are things which are clearly right. There are things which are clearly wrong. For in our hearts we know that impunity, in any form, should be abhorred especially when it gives advantage to the privileged and the powerful.Thus, I dissent.ACCORDINGLY, contrary to the majority, I vote to GRANT the petition and the petition-in-intervention. The assailed resolutions dated April 1, 2013 of the Second Division of public respondent Commission on Elections (COMELEC), and April 23, 2013 of public respondent COMELEC, sitting En Banc, must be ANNULLED and SET ASIDE.Private respondent Joseph Ejercito Estrada continues to suffer the penalty of perpetual absolute disqualification and is thereby DISQUALIFIED from exercising the right to vote in any election for any popular elective office or to be elected to such office.[1] Rep.

Gonzaga-Reyes, Third Division].[204] Id. at 868\u2013872:We agree with the finding of the Court of Appeals that the Memorandum of Agreement dated July 29, 1988 was in the nature of a conventional subrogation which requires the consent of the debtor, Anglo-Asean Bank, for its validity. We note with approval the following pronouncement of the Court of Appeals:\u201cImmediately discernible from above is the common feature of contracts involving conventional subrogation, namely, the approval of the debtor to the subrogation of a third person in place of the creditor. That Gatmaitan and Licaros had intended to treat their agreement as one of conventional subrogation is plainly borne by a stipulation in their Memorandum of Agreement, to wit:\"WHEREAS, the parties herein have come to an agreement on the nature, form and extent of their mutual prestations which they now record herein with the express conformity of the third parties concerned\" (emphasis supplied), which third party is admittedly Anglo-Asean Bank.Had the intention been merely to confer on appellant the status of a mere \"assignee\" of appellee's credit, there is simply no sense for them to have stipulated in their agreement that the same is conditioned on the \"express conformity\" thereto of Anglo-Asean Bank. That they did so only accentuates their intention to treat the agreement as one of conventional subrogation. And it is basic in the interpretation of contracts that the intention of the parties must be the one pursued (Rule 130, Section 12, Rules of Court).. . . .As previously discussed, the intention of the parties to treat the Memorandum of Agreement as embodying a conventional subrogation is shown not only by the \"whereas clause\" but also by the signature space captioned \"WITH OUR CONFORME\" reserved for the signature of a representative of Anglo-Asean Bank. These provisions in the aforementioned Memorandum of Agreement may not simply be disregarded or dismissed as superfluous.It is a basic rule in the interpretation of contracts that \u201c(t)he various stipulations of a contract shall be interpreted together, attributing to the doubtful ones that sense which may result from all of them taken jointly.\u201d Moreover, under our Rules of Court, it is mandated that \u201c(i)n the construction of an instrument where there are several provisions or particulars, such a construction is, if possible, to be adopted as will give effect to all.\u201d Further, jurisprudence has laid down the rule that contracts should be so construed as to harmonize and give effect to the different provisions thereof. (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)[205] 605 Phil. 474 (2009) [Per J. Tinga, Second Division].[206] Id. at 487\u2013488:One line of argument raised by Kuwait Airways can be dismissed outright. Kuwait Airways points out that the third Whereas clause of the 1981 Commercial Agreement stated: \u201cNOW, it is hereby agreed, subject to and without prejudice to any existing or future agreements between the Government Authorities of the Contracting Parties hereto. . . .\u201d That clause, it is argued, evinces acknowledgement that from the beginning Philippine Airlines had known fully well that its rights under the Commercial Agreement would be limited by whatever agreements the Philippine and Kuwait governments may enter into later.But can a perambulatory clause, which is what the adverted \u201cWhereas\u201d clause is, impose a binding obligation or limitation on the contracting parties? In the case of statutes, while a preamble manifests the reasons for the passage of the statute and aids in the interpretation of any ambiguities within the statute to which it is prefixed, it nonetheless is not an essential part of an act, and it neither enlarges nor confers powers. Philippine Airlines submits that the same holds true as to the preambular whereas clauses of a contract.What was the intention of the parties in forging the \u201cWhereas\u201d clause and the contexts the parties understood it in 1981? In order to judge the intention of the contracting parties, their contemporaneous and subsequent acts shall be principally considered, and in doing so, the courts may consider the relations existing between the parties and the purpose of the contract. In 1981, Philippine Airlines was still owned by the Philippine government. In that context, it is evident that the Philippine government, as owner Philippine Airlines, could enter into agreements with the Kuwait government that would supersede the Commercial Agreement entered into by one of its GOCCs, a scenario that changed once Philippine Airlines fell to private ownership. Philippine Airlines argues before us that the cited preambular stipulation is in fact superfluous, and we can agree in the sense that as of the time of the execution of the Commercial Agreement, it was evident, without need of stipulation, that the Philippine government could enter into an agreement with the Kuwait government that would prejudice the terms of the commercial arrangements between the two airlines. After all, Philippine Airlines then would not have been in a position to challenge the wishes of its then majority stockholder \u2013 the Philippine government. (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)[207] 332 Phil. 20 (1996) [Per J. Panganiban, En Banc].[208] Id. at 32\u201333:Petitioners\u2019 contentions are not supported by law. We hold that Res. 56 constitutes a supplementary retirement plan.A cursory examination of the preambular clauses and provisions of Res. 56 provides a number of clear indications that its financial assistance plan constitutes a supplemental retirement/pension benefits plan. In particular, the fifth preambular clause which provides that \u201cit is the policy of the Social Security Commission to promote and to protect the interest of all SSS employees, with a view to providing for their well-being during both their working and retirement years,\u201d and the wording of the resolution itself which states \u201cResolved, further, that SSS employees who availed themselves of the said life annuity (under RA 660), in appreciation and recognition of their long and faithful service, be granted financial assistance x x x\u201d can only be interpreted to mean that the benefit being granted is none other than a kind of amelioration to enable the retiring employee to enjoy (or survive) his retirement years and a reward for his loyalty and service. Moreover, it is plain to see that the grant of said financial assistance is inextricably linked with and inseparable from the application for and approval of retirement benefits under RA 660, i.e., that availment of said financial assistance under Res. 56 may not be done independently of but only in conjunction with the availment of retirement benefits under RA 660, and that the former is in augmentation or supplementation of the latter benefits.[209] En Banc Resolution Providing for Other Sources of the Judiciary Development Fund dated September 14, 1999.[210] Pres.

COMMISSION ON ELECTIONS AND JOSEPH EJERCITO ESTRADA, RESPONDENTS.\n\nD E C I S I O N\n\nLEONARDO-DE CASTRO, J.:\n\nBefore the Court are (1) a Petition for Certiorari filed under Rule 64, in relation to Rule 65, both of the Revised Rules of Court, by Atty. Alicia Risos-Vidal (Risos-Vidal), which essentially prays for the issuance of the writ of certiorari annulling and setting aside the April 1, 2013 [1] and April 23, 2013 [2] Resolutions of the Commission on Elections (COMELEC), Second Division and En banc, respectively, in SPA No. 13-211 (DC), entitled \u201c Atty. Alicia Risos-Vidal v. Joseph Ejercito Estrada \u201d for having been rendered with grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction; and (2) a Petition-in-Intervention [3] filed by Alfredo S. Lim (Lim), wherein he prays to be declared the 2013 winning candidate for Mayor of the City of Manila in view of private respondent former President Joseph Ejercito Estrada\u2019s (former President Estrada) disqualification to run for and hold public office.\n\nThe Facts\n\nThe salient facts of the case are as follows:\n\nOn September 12, 2007, the Sandiganbayan convicted former President Estrada, a former President of the Republic of the Philippines, for the crime of plunder in Criminal Case No. 26558, entitled \u201c People of the Philippines v. Joseph Ejercito Estrada, et al. \u201d The dispositive part of the graft court\u2019s decision reads:\nWHEREFORE, in view of all the foregoing, judgment is hereby rendered in Criminal Case No. 26558 finding the accused, Former President Joseph Ejercito Estrada, GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of PLUNDER , defined in and penalized by Republic Act No. 7080, as amended. On the other hand, for failure of the prosecution to prove and establish their guilt beyond reasonable doubt, the Court finds the accused Jose \u201cJinggoy\u201d Estrada and Atty. Edward S. Serapio NOT GUILTY of the crime of plunder, and accordingly, the Court hereby orders their ACQUITTAL .\n\nThe penalty imposable for the crime of plunder under Republic Act No. 7080, as amended by Republic Act No. 7659, is Reclusion Perpetua to Death. There being no aggravating or mitigating circumstances, however, the lesser penalty shall be applied in accordance with Article 63 of the Revised Penal Code. Accordingly, the accused Former President Joseph Ejercito Estrada is hereby sentenced to suffer the penalty of Reclusion Perpetua and the accessory penalties of civil interdiction during the period of sentence and perpetual absolute disqualification.\n\nThe period within which accused Former President Joseph Ejercito Estrada has been under detention shall be credited to him in full as long as he agrees voluntarily in writing to abide by the same disciplinary rules imposed upon convicted prisoners.\n\nMoreover, in accordance with Section 2 of Republic Act No. 7080, as amended by Republic Act No. 7659, the Court hereby declares the forfeiture in favor of the government of the following:\n(1) The total amount of Five Hundred Forty[-]Two Million Seven Hundred Ninety[-]One Thousand Pesos (P545,291,000.00), with interest and income earned, inclusive of the amount of Two Hundred Million Pesos (P200,000,000.00), deposited in the name and account of the Erap Muslim Youth Foundation.\n\n(2) The amount of One Hundred Eighty[-]Nine Million Pesos (P189,000,000.00), inclusive of interests and income earned, deposited in the Jose Velarde account.\n\n(3) The real property consisting of a house and lot dubbed as \u201cBoracay Mansion\u201d located at #100 11th Street, New Manila, Quezon City.\nThe cash bonds posted by accused Jose \u201cJinggoy\u201d Estrada and Atty. Edward S. Serapio are hereby ordered cancelled and released to the said accused or their duly authorized representatives upon presentation of the original receipt evidencing payment thereof and subject to the usual accounting and auditing procedures. Likewise, the hold-departure orders issued against the said accused are hereby recalled and declared functus oficio . [4]\nOn October 25, 2007, however, former President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo (former President Arroyo) extended executive clemency, by way of pardon, to former President Estrada. The full text of said pardon states:\n\nMALACA\u00d1AN PALACE\nMANILA\n____________________________________________________\n\nBy the President of the Philippines\n\nPARDON\n_____________________________________________________\n\nWHEREAS, this Administration has a policy of releasing inmates who have reached the age of seventy (70),\n\nWHEREAS, Joseph Ejercito Estrada has been under detention for six and a half years,\n\nWHEREAS, Joseph Ejercito Estrada has publicly committed to no longer seek any elective position or office,\n\nIN VIEW HEREOF and pursuant to the authority conferred upon me by the Constitution, I hereby grant executive clemency to JOSEPH EJERCITO ESTRADA , convicted by the Sandiganbayan of Plunder and imposed a penalty of Reclusion Perpetua. He is hereby restored to his civil and political rights.\n\nThe forfeitures imposed by the Sandiganbayan remain in force and in full, including all writs and processes issued by the Sandiganbayan in pursuance hereof, except for the bank account(s) he owned before his tenure as President.\n\nUpon acceptance of this pardon by JOSEPH EJERCITO ESTRADA , this pardon shall take effect.\n\nGiven under my hand at the City of Manila,\nthis 25 th Day of October, in the year of\nOur Lord, two thousand and seven.\n\nGloria M. Arroyo (sgd.)\n\nBy the President:\n\nIGNACIO R. BUNYE (sgd.)\nActing Executive Secretary [5]\nOn October 26, 2007, at 3:35 p.m., former President Estrada \u201creceived and accepted\u201d [6] the pardon by affixing his signature beside his handwritten notation thereon.\n\nOn November 30, 2009, former President Estrada filed a Certificate of Candidacy [7] for the position of President. During that time, his candidacy earned three oppositions in the COMELEC: (1) SPA No. 09-024 (DC) , a \u201cPetition to Deny Due Course and Cancel Certificate of Candidacy\u201d filed by Rev. Elly Velez B. Lao Pamatong, ESQ; (2) SPA No. 09-028 (DC) , a petition for \u201cDisqualification as Presidential Candidate\u201d filed by Evilio C. Pormento (Pormento); and (3) SPA No. 09-104 (DC) , a \u201cPetition to Disqualify Estrada Ejercito, Joseph M. from Running as President due to Constitutional Disqualification and Creating Confusion to the Prejudice of Estrada, Mary Lou B\u201d filed by Mary Lou Estrada. In separate Resolutions [8] dated January 20, 2010 by the COMELEC, Second Division, however, all three petitions were effectively dismissed on the uniform grounds that ( i ) the Constitutional proscription on reelection applies to a sitting president; and ( ii ) the pardon granted to former President Estrada by former President Arroyo restored the former\u2019s right to vote and be voted for a public office. The subsequent motions for reconsideration thereto were denied by the COMELEC En banc .\n\nAfter the conduct of the May 10, 2010 synchronized elections, however, former President Estrada only managed to garner the second highest number of votes.\n\nOf the three petitioners above-mentioned, only Pormento sought recourse to this Court and filed a petition for certiorari , which was docketed as G.R. No. 191988, entitled \u201c Atty. Evilio C. Pormento v. Joseph \u2018ERAP\u2019 Ejercito Estrada and Commission on Elections .\u201d But in a Resolution [9] dated August 31, 2010, the Court dismissed the aforementioned petition on the ground of mootness considering that former President Estrada lost his presidential bid.\n\nOn October 2, 2012, former President Estrada once more ventured into the political arena, and filed a Certificate of Candidacy, [10] this time vying for a local elective post, that of the Mayor of the City of Manila.\n\nOn January 24, 2013, Risos-Vidal, the petitioner in this case, filed a Petition for Disqualification against former President Estrada before the COMELEC. The petition was docketed as SPA No. 13-211 (DC). Risos-Vidal anchored her petition on the theory that \u201c[Former President Estrada] is Disqualified to Run for Public Office because of his Conviction for Plunder by the Sandiganbayan in Criminal Case No. 26558 entitled \u2018People of the Philippines vs. Joseph Ejercito Estrada\u2019 Sentencing Him to Suffer the Penalty of Reclusion Perpetua with Perpetual Absolute Disqualification.\u201d [11] She relied on Section 40 of the Local Government Code (LGC), in relation to Section 12 of the Omnibus Election Code (OEC), which state respectively, that:\nSec. 40, Local Government Code:\n\nSECTION 40. Disqualifications. - The following persons are disqualified from running for any elective local position:\n\n(a) Those sentenced by final judgment for an offense involving moral turpitude or for an offense punishable by one (1) year or more of imprisonment, within two (2) years after serving sentence;\n\n(b) Those removed from office as a result of an administrative case;\n\n(c) Those convicted by final judgment for violating the oath of allegiance to the Republic;\n\n(d) Those with dual citizenship;\n\n(e) Fugitives from justice in criminal or nonpolitical cases here or abroad;\n\n(f) Permanent residents in a foreign country or those who have acquired the right to reside abroad and continue to avail of the same right after the effectivity of this Code; and\n\n(g) The insane or feeble minded. (Emphasis supplied.)\n\nSec. 12, Omnibus Election Code:\n\nSection 12. Disqualifications. - Any person who has been declared by competent authority insane or incompetent, or has been sentenced by final judgment for subversion, insurrection, rebellion, or for any offense for which he has been sentenced to a penalty of more than eighteen months or for a crime involving moral turpitude, shall be disqualified to be a candidate and to hold any public office, unless he has been given plenary pardon or granted amnesty . (Emphases supplied.)\nIn a Resolution dated April 1, 2013, the COMELEC, Second Division, dismissed the petition for disqualification, the fallo of which reads:\n\nWHEREFORE, premises considered, the instant petition is hereby DISMISSED for utter lack of merit. [12]\n\nThe COMELEC, Second Division, opined that \u201c[h]aving taken judicial cognizance of the consolidated resolution for SPA No. 09-028 (DC) and SPA No. 09-104 (DC) and the 10 May 2010 En Banc resolution affirming it, this Commission will not belabor the controversy further. Moreso, [Risos-Vidal] failed to present cogent proof sufficient to reverse the standing pronouncement of this Commission declaring categorically that [former President Estrada\u2019s] right to seek public office has been effectively restored by the pardon vested upon him by former President Gloria M. Arroyo. Since this Commission has already spoken, it will no longer engage in disquisitions of a settled matter lest indulged in wastage of government resources.\u201d [13]\n\nThe subsequent motion for reconsideration filed by Risos-Vidal was denied in a Resolution dated April 23, 2013.\n\nOn April 30, 2013, Risos-Vidal invoked the Court\u2019s jurisdiction by filing the present petition. She presented five issues for the Court\u2019s resolution, to wit:\nI. RESPONDENT COMELEC COMMITTED GRAVE ABUSE OF DISCRETION AMOUNTING TO LACK OR EXCESS OF JURISDICTION IN HOLDING THAT RESPONDENT ESTRADA\u2019S PARDON WAS NOT CONDITIONAL;\n\nII. RESPONDENT COMELEC COMMITTED GRAVE ABUSE OF DISCRETION AMOUNTING TO LACK OR EXCESS OF JURISDICTION IN NOT FINDING THAT RESPONDENT ESTRADA IS DISQUALIFIED TO RUN AS MAYOR OF MANILA UNDER SEC. 40 OF THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT CODE OF 1991 FOR HAVING BEEN CONVICTED OF PLUNDER, AN OFFENSE INVOLVING MORAL TURPITUDE;\n\nIII. RESPONDENT COMELEC COMMITTED GRAVE ABUSE OF DISCRETION AMOUNTING TO LACK OR EXCESS OF JURISDICTION IN DISMISSING THE PETITION FOR DISQUALIFICATION ON THE GROUND THAT THE CASE INVOLVES THE SAME OR SIMILAR ISSUES IT ALREADY RESOLVED IN THE CASES OF \u201cPORMENTO VS. ESTRADA\u201d, SPA NO. 09-028 (DC) AND IN \u201c RE: PETITION TO DISQUALIFY ESTRADA EJERCITO, JOSEPH M. FROM RUNNING AS PRESIDENT, ETC., \u201d SPA NO. 09-104 (DC);\n\nIV. RESPONDENT COMELEC COMMITTED GRAVE ABUSE OF DISCRETION AMOUNTING TO LACK OR EXCESS OF JURISDICTION IN NOT RULING THAT RESPONDENT ESTRADA\u2019S PARDON NEITHER RESTORED HIS RIGHT OF SUFFRAGE NOR REMITTED HIS PERPETUAL ABSOLUTE DISQUALIFICATION FROM SEEKING PUBLIC OFFICE; and\n\nV. RESPONDENT COMELEC COMMITTED GRAVE ABUSE OF DISCRETION AMOUNTING TO LACK OR EXCESS OF JURISDICTION IN NOT HAVING EXERCISED ITS POWER TO MOTU PROPRIO DISQUALIFY RESPONDENT ESTRADA IN THE FACE OF HIS PATENT DISQUALIFICATION TO RUN FOR PUBLIC OFFICE BECAUSE OF HIS PERPETUAL AND ABSOLUTE DISQUALIFICATION TO SEEK PUBLIC OFFICE AND TO VOTE RESULTING FROM HIS CRIMINAL CONVICTION FOR PLUNDER. [14]\nWhile this case was pending before the Court, or on May 13, 2013, the elections were conducted as scheduled and former President Estrada was voted into office with 349,770 votes cast in his favor. The next day, the local board of canvassers proclaimed him as the duly elected Mayor of the City of Manila.\n\nOn June 7, 2013, Lim, one of former President Estrada\u2019s opponents for the position of Mayor, moved for leave to intervene in this case. His motion was granted by the Court in a Resolution [15] dated June 25, 2013. Lim subscribed to Risos-Vidal\u2019s theory that former President Estrada is disqualified to run for and hold public office as the pardon granted to the latter failed to expressly remit his perpetual disqualification. Further, given that former President Estrada is disqualified to run for and hold public office, all the votes obtained by the latter should be declared stray, and, being the second placer with 313,764 votes to his name, he (Lim) should be declared the rightful winning candidate for the position of Mayor of the City of Manila.\n\nThe Issue\n\nThough raising five seemingly separate issues for resolution, the petition filed by Risos-Vidal actually presents only one essential question for resolution by the Court, that is, whether or not the COMELEC committed grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction in ruling that former President Estrada is qualified to vote and be voted for in public office as a result of the pardon granted to him by former President Arroyo .\n\nIn her petition, Risos-Vidal starts her discussion by pointing out that the pardon granted to former President Estrada was conditional as evidenced by the latter\u2019s express acceptance thereof. The \u201cacceptance,\u201d she claims, is an indication of the conditional nature of the pardon, with the condition being embodied in the third Whereas Clause of the pardon, i.e. , \u201cWHEREAS, Joseph Ejercito Estrada has publicly committed to no longer seek any elective position or office.\u201d She explains that the aforementioned commitment was what impelled former President Arroyo to pardon former President Estrada, without it, the clemency would not have been extended. And any breach thereof, that is, when former President Estrada filed his Certificate of Candidacy for President and Mayor of the City of Manila, he breached the condition of the pardon; hence, \u201che ought to be recommitted to prison to serve the unexpired portion of his sentence x x x and disqualifies him as a candidate for the mayoralty [position] of Manila.\u201d [16]\n\nNonetheless, Risos-Vidal clarifies that the fundamental basis upon which former President Estrada must be disqualified from running for and holding public elective office is actually the proscription found in Section 40 of the LGC, in relation to Section 12 of the OEC. She argues that the crime of plunder is both an offense punishable by imprisonment of one year or more and involving moral turpitude; such that former President Estrada must be disqualified to run for and hold public elective office.\n\nEven with the pardon granted to former President Estrada, however, Risos-Vidal insists that the same did not operate to make available to former President Estrada the exception provided under Section 12 of the OEC, the pardon being merely conditional and not absolute or plenary.\n\nMoreover, Risos-Vidal puts a premium on the ostensible requirements provided under Articles 36 and 41 of the Revised Penal Code, to wit:\nART. 36. Pardon; its effects . \u2013 A pardon shall not work the restoration of the right to hold public office, or the right of suffrage, unless such rights be expressly restored by the terms of the pardon .\n\nA pardon shall in no case exempt the culprit from the payment of the civil indemnity imposed upon him by the sentence.\n\nx x x x\n\nART. 41. Reclusion perpetua and reclusion temporal \u2013 Their accessory penalties . \u2013 The penalties of reclusion perpetua and reclusion temporal shall carry with them that of civil interdiction for life or during the period of the sentence as the case may be, and that of perpetual absolute disqualification which the offender shall suffer even though pardoned as to the principal penalty, unless the same shall have been expressly remitted in the pardon . (Emphases supplied.)\nShe avers that in view of the foregoing provisions of law, it is not enough that a pardon makes a general statement that such pardon carries with it the restoration of civil and political rights. By virtue of Articles 36 and 41, a pardon restoring civil and political rights without categorically making mention what specific civil and political rights are restored \u201cshall not work to restore the right to hold public office, or the right of suffrage; nor shall it remit the accessory penalties of civil interdiction and perpetual absolute disqualification for the principal penalties of reclusion perpetua and reclusion temporal .\u201d [17] In other words, she considers the above constraints as mandatory requirements that shun a general or implied restoration of civil and political rights in pardons.\n\nRisos-Vidal cites the concurring opinions of Associate Justices Teodoro R. Padilla and Florentino P. Feliciano in Monsanto v. Factoran, Jr . [18] to endorse her position that \u201c[t]he restoration of the right to hold public office to one who has lost such right by reason of conviction in a criminal case, but subsequently pardoned, cannot be left to inference, no matter how intensely arguable, but must be stated in express, explicit, positive and specific language.\u201d\n\nApplying Monsanto to former President Estrada\u2019s case, Risos-Vidal reckons that \u201csuch express restoration is further demanded by the existence of the condition in the [third] [W]hereas [C]lause of the pardon x x x indubitably indicating that the privilege to hold public office was not restored to him.\u201d [19]\n\nOn the other hand, the Office of the Solicitor General (OSG) for public respondent COMELEC, maintains that \u201cthe issue of whether or not the pardon extended to [former President Estrada] restored his right to run for public office had already been passed upon by public respondent COMELEC way back in 2010 via its rulings in SPA Nos. 09-024, 09-028 and 09-104, there is no cogent reason for it to reverse its standing pronouncement and declare [former President Estrada] disqualified to run and be voted as mayor of the City of Manila in the absence of any new argument that would warrant its reversal. To be sure, public respondent COMELEC correctly exercised its discretion in taking judicial cognizance of the aforesaid rulings which are known to it and which can be verified from its own records, in accordance with Section 2, Rule 129 of the Rules of Court on the courts\u2019 discretionary power to take judicial notice of matters which are of public knowledge, or are capable of unquestionable demonstration, or ought to be known to them because of their judicial functions.\u201d [20]\n\nFurther, the OSG contends that \u201c[w]hile at first glance, it is apparent that [former President Estrada\u2019s] conviction for plunder disqualifies him from running as mayor of Manila under Section 40 of the [LGC], the subsequent grant of pardon to him, however, effectively restored his right to run for any public office.\u201d [21] The restoration of his right to run for any public office is the exception to the prohibition under Section 40 of the LGC, as provided under Section 12 of the OEC. As to the seeming requirement of Articles 36 and 41 of the Revised Penal Code, i.e. , the express restoration/remission of a particular right to be stated in the pardon, the OSG asserts that \u201can airtight and rigid interpretation of Article 36 and Article 41 of the [RPC] x x x would be stretching too much the clear and plain meaning of the aforesaid provisions.\u201d [22] Lastly, taking into consideration the third Whereas Clause of the pardon granted to former President Estrada, the OSG supports the position that it \u201cis not an integral part of the decree of the pardon and cannot therefore serve to restrict its effectivity.\u201d [23]\n\nThus, the OSG concludes that the \u201cCOMELEC did not commit grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction in issuing the assailed Resolutions.\u201d [24]\n\nFor his part, former President Estrada presents the following significant arguments to defend his stay in office: that \u201cthe factual findings of public respondent COMELEC, the Constitutional body mandated to administer and enforce all laws relative to the conduct of the elections, [relative to the absoluteness of the pardon, the effects thereof, and the eligibility of former President Estrada to seek public elective office] are binding [and conclusive] on this Honorable Supreme Court;\u201d that he \u201cwas granted an absolute pardon and thereby restored to his full civil and political rights, including the right to seek public elective office such as the mayoral (sic) position in the City of Manila;\u201d that \u201cthe majority decision in the case of Salvacion A. Monsanto v. Fulgencio S. Factoran, Jr. , which was erroneously cited by both Vidal and Lim as authority for their respective claims, x x x reveal that there was no discussion whatsoever in the ratio decidendi of the Monsanto case as to the alleged necessity for an expressed restoration of the \u2018right to hold public office in the pardon\u2019 as a legal pre-requisite to remove the subject perpetual special disqualification;\u201d that moreover, the \u201cprincipal question raised in this Monsanto case is whether or not a public officer, who has been granted an absolute pardon by the Chief Executive, is entitled to reinstatement to her former position without need of a new appointment;\u201d that his \u201cexpressed acceptance [of the pardon] is not proof that the pardon extended to [him] is conditional and not absolute;\u201d that this case is a mere rehash of the cases filed against him during his candidacy for President back in 2009-2010; that Articles 36 and 41 of the Revised Penal Code \u201ccannot abridge or diminish the pardoning power of the President expressly granted by the Constitution;\u201d that the text of the pardon granted to him substantially, if not fully, complied with the requirement posed by Article 36 of the Revised Penal Code as it was categorically stated in the said document that he was \u201crestored to his civil and political rights;\u201d that since pardon is an act of grace, it must be construed favorably in favor of the grantee; [25] and that his disqualification will result in massive disenfranchisement of the hundreds of thousands of Manile\u00f1os who voted for him. [26]\n\nThe Court\u2019s Ruling\n\nThe petition for certiorari lacks merit.\n\nFormer President Estrada was granted an absolute pardon that fully restored all his civil and political rights, which naturally includes the right to seek public elective office, the focal point of this controversy. The wording of the pardon extended to former President Estrada is complete, unambiguous, and unqualified. It is likewise unfettered by Articles 36 and 41 of the Revised Penal Code. The only reasonable, objective, and constitutional interpretation of the language of the pardon is that the same in fact conforms to Articles 36 and 41 of the Revised Penal Code.\n\nRecall that the petition for disqualification filed by Risos-Vidal against former President Estrada, docketed as SPA No. 13-\u00ad\u00ad211 (DC), was anchored on Section 40 of the LGC, in relation to Section 12 of the OEC, that is, having been convicted of a crime punishable by imprisonment of one year or more, and involving moral turpitude, former President Estrada must be disqualified to run for and hold public elective office notwithstanding the fact that he is a grantee of a pardon that includes a statement expressing \u201c [h]e is hereby restored to his civil and political rights .\u201d\n\nRisos-Vidal theorizes that former President Estrada is disqualified from running for Mayor of Manila in the May 13, 2013 Elections, and remains disqualified to hold any local elective post despite the presidential pardon extended to him in 2007 by former President Arroyo for the reason that it (pardon) did not expressly provide for the remission of the penalty of perpetual absolute disqualification, particularly the restoration of his (former President Estrada) right to vote and be voted upon for public office. She invokes Articles 36 and 41 of the Revised Penal Code as the foundations of her theory.\n\nIt is insisted that, since a textual examination of the pardon given to and accepted by former President Estrada does not actually specify which political right is restored, it could be inferred that former President Arroyo did not deliberately intend to restore former President Estrada\u2019s rights of suffrage and to hold public office, or to otherwise remit the penalty of perpetual absolute disqualification. Even if her intention was the contrary, the same cannot be upheld based on the pardon\u2019s text.\n\nThe pardoning power of the President cannot be limited by legislative action.\n\nThe 1987 Constitution, specifically Section 19 of Article VII and Section 5 of Article IX-C, provides that the President of the Philippines possesses the power to grant pardons, along with other acts of executive clemency, to wit:\nSection 19. Except in cases of impeachment, or as otherwise provided in this Constitution, the President may grant reprieves, commutations, and pardons, and remit fines and forfeitures, after conviction by final judgment.\n\nHe shall also have the power to grant amnesty with the concurrence of a majority of all the Members of the Congress.\n\nx x x x\n\nSection 5. No pardon, amnesty, parole, or suspension of sentence for violation of election laws, rules, and regulations shall be granted by the President without the favorable recommendation of the Commission.\nIt is apparent from the foregoing constitutional provisions that the only instances in which the President may not extend pardon remain to be in: (1) impeachment cases; (2) cases that have not yet resulted in a final conviction; and (3) cases involving violations of election laws, rules and regulations in which there was no favorable recommendation coming from the COMELEC. Therefore, it can be argued that any act of Congress by way of statute cannot operate to delimit the pardoning power of the President.\n\nIn Cristobal v. Labrador [27] and Pelobello v. Palatino , [28] which were decided under the 1935 Constitution, wherein the provision granting pardoning power to the President shared similar phraseology with what is found in the present 1987 Constitution, the Court then unequivocally declared that \u201csubject to the limitations imposed by the Constitution, the pardoning power cannot be restricted or controlled by legislative action.\u201d The Court reiterated this pronouncement in Monsanto v. Factoran, Jr. [29] thereby establishing that, under the present Constitution, \u201ca pardon, being a presidential prerogative, should not be circumscribed by legislative action.\u201d Thus, it is unmistakably the long-standing position of this Court that the exercise of the pardoning power is discretionary in the President and may not be interfered with by Congress or the Court, except only when it exceeds the limits provided for by the Constitution.\n\nThis doctrine of non-diminution or non-impairment of the President\u2019s power of pardon by acts of Congress, specifically through legislation, was strongly adhered to by an overwhelming majority of the framers of the 1987 Constitution when they flatly rejected a proposal to carve out an exception from the pardoning power of the President in the form of \u201coffenses involving graft and corruption\u201d that would be enumerated and defined by Congress through the enactment of a law. The following is the pertinent portion lifted from the Record of the Commission (Vol. II):\nMR. ROMULO. I ask that Commissioner Tan be recognized to introduce an amendment on the same section.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT. Commissioner Tan is recognized.\n\nSR. TAN. Madam President, lines 7 to 9 state:\n\nHowever, the power to grant executive clemency for violations of corrupt practices laws may be limited by legislation.\n\nI suggest that this be deleted on the grounds that, first, violations of corrupt practices may include a very little offense like stealing P10; second, which I think is more important, I get the impression, rightly or wrongly, that subconsciously we are drafting a constitution on the premise that all our future Presidents will be bad and dishonest and, consequently, their acts will be lacking in wisdom. Therefore, this Article seems to contribute towards the creation of an anti-President Constitution or a President with vast responsibilities but no corresponding power except to declare martial law. Therefore, I request that these lines be deleted .\n\nMR. REGALADO. Madam President, may the Committee react to that?\n\nTHE PRESIDENT. Yes, please.\n\nMR. REGALADO. This was inserted here on the resolution of Commissioner Davide because of the fact that similar to the provisions on the Commission on Elections, the recommendation of that Commission is required before executive clemency is granted because violations of the election laws go into the very political life of the country.\n\nWith respect to violations of our Corrupt Practices Law, we felt that it is also necessary to have that subjected to the same condition because violation of our Corrupt Practices Law may be of such magnitude as to affect the very economic system of the country. Nevertheless, as a compromise, we provided here that it will be the Congress that will provide for the classification as to which convictions will still require prior recommendation; after all, the Congress could take into account whether or not the violation of the Corrupt Practices Law is of such magnitude as to affect the economic life of the country, if it is in the millions or billions of dollars. But I assume the Congress in its collective wisdom will exclude those petty crimes of corruption as not to require any further stricture on the exercise of executive clemency because, of course, there is a whale of a difference if we consider a lowly clerk committing malversation of government property or funds involving one hundred pesos. But then, we also anticipate the possibility that the corrupt practice of a public officer is of such magnitude as to have virtually drained a substantial portion of the treasury, and then he goes through all the judicial processes and later on, a President who may have close connections with him or out of improvident compassion may grant clemency under such conditions. That is why we left it to Congress to provide and make a classification based on substantial distinctions between a minor act of corruption or an act of substantial proportions.\n\nSR. TAN. So, why do we not just insert the word GROSS or GRAVE before the word \u201cviolations\u201d?\n\nMR. REGALADO. We feel that Congress can make a better distinction because \u201cGRAVE\u201d or \u201cGROSS\u201d can be misconstrued by putting it purely as a policy.\n\nMR. RODRIGO. Madam President.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT. Commissioner Rodrigo is recognized.\n\nMR. RODRIGO. May I speak in favor of the proposed amendment?\n\nTHE PRESIDENT. Please proceed.\n\nMR. RODRIGO. The power to grant executive clemency is essentially an executive power, and that is precisely why it is called executive clemency. In this sentence, which the amendment seeks to delete, an exception is being made. Congress, which is the legislative arm, is allowed to intrude into this prerogative of the executive. Then it limits the power of Congress to subtract from this prerogative of the President to grant executive clemency by limiting the power of Congress to only corrupt practices laws. There are many other crimes more serious than these. Under this amendment, Congress cannot limit the power of executive clemency in cases of drug addiction and drug pushing which are very, very serious crimes that can endanger the State; also, rape with murder, kidnapping and treason. Aside from the fact that it is a derogation of the power of the President to grant executive clemency, it is also defective in that it singles out just one kind of crime. There are far more serious crimes which are not included.\n\nMR. REGALADO. I will just make one observation on that. We admit that the pardoning power is an executive power. But even in the provisions on the COMELEC, one will notice that constitutionally, it is required that there be a favorable recommendation by the Commission on Elections for any violation of election laws.\n\nAt any rate, Commissioner Davide, as the principal proponent of that and as a member of the Committee, has explained in the committee meetings we had why he sought the inclusion of this particular provision. May we call on Commissioner Davide to state his position.\n\nMR. DAVIDE. Madam President.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT. Commissioner Davide is recognized.\n\nMR. DAVIDE. I am constrained to rise to object to the proposal. We have just approved the Article on Accountability of Public Officers. Under it, it is mandated that a public office is a public trust, and all government officers are under obligation to observe the utmost of responsibility, integrity, loyalty and efficiency, to lead modest lives and to act with patriotism and justice.\n\nIn all cases, therefore, which would go into the very core of the concept that a public office is a public trust, the violation is itself a violation not only of the economy but the moral fabric of public officials. And that is the reason we now want that if there is any conviction for the violation of the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act, which, in effect, is a violation of the public trust character of the public office, no pardon shall be extended to the offender, unless some limitations are imposed.\n\nOriginally, my limitation was, it should be with the concurrence of the convicting court, but the Committee left it entirely to the legislature to formulate the mechanics at trying, probably, to distinguish between grave and less grave or serious cases of violation of the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act. Perhaps this is now the best time, since we have strengthened the Article on Accountability of Public Officers, to accompany it with a mandate that the President\u2019s right to grant executive clemency for offenders or violators of laws relating to the concept of a public office may be limited by Congress itself.\n\nMR. SARMIENTO. Madam President.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT. Commissioner Sarmiento is recognized.\n\nMR. SARMIENTO. May I briefly speak in favor of the amendment by deletion.\n\nMadam President, over and over again, we have been saying and arguing before this Constitutional Commission that we are emasculating the powers of the presidency, and this provision to me is another clear example of that . So, I speak against this provision. Even the 1935 and the 1973 Constitutions do not provide for this kind of provision.\n\nI am supporting the amendment by deletion of Commissioner Tan.\n\nMR. ROMULO. Commissioner Tingson would like to be recognized.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT. Commissioner Tingson is recognized.\n\nMR. TINGSON. Madam President, I am also in favor of the amendment by deletion because I am in sympathy with the stand of Commissioner Francisco \u201cSoc\u201d Rodrigo. I do believe and we should remember that above all the elected or appointed officers of our Republic, the leader is the President. I believe that the country will be as the President is, and if we systematically emasculate the power of this presidency, the time may come when he will be also handcuffed that he will no longer be able to act like he should be acting .\n\nSo, Madam President, I am in favor of the deletion of this particular line.\n\nMR. ROMULO. Commissioner Colayco would like to be recognized.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT. Commissioner Colayco is recognized.\n\nMR. COLAYCO. Thank you very much, Madam President.\n\nI seldom rise here to object to or to commend or to recommend the approval of proposals, but now I find that the proposal of Commissioner Tan is worthy of approval of this body.\n\nWhy are we singling out this particular offense? There are other crimes which cast a bigger blot on the moral character of the public officials.\n\nFinally, this body should not be the first one to limit the almost absolute power of our Chief Executive in deciding whether to pardon , to reprieve or to commute the sentence rendered by the court.\n\nI thank you.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT. Are we ready to vote now?\n\nMR. ROMULO. Commissioner Padilla would like to be recognized, and after him will be Commissioner Natividad.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT. Commissioner Padilla is recognized.\n\nMR. PADILLA. Only one sentence, Madam President. The Sandiganbayan has been called the Anti-Graft Court, so if this is allowed to stay, it would mean that the President\u2019s power to grant pardon or reprieve will be limited to the cases decided by the Anti-Graft Court, when as already stated, there are many provisions in the Revised Penal Code that penalize more serious offenses .\n\nMoreover, when there is a judgment of conviction and the case merits the consideration of the exercise of executive clemency, usually under Article V of the Revised Penal Code the judge will recommend such exercise of clemency. And so, I am in favor of the amendment proposed by Commissioner Tan for the deletion of this last sentence in Section 17.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT. Are we ready to vote now, Mr. Floor Leader?\n\nMR. NATIVIDAD. Just one more.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT. Commissioner Natividad is recognized.\n\nMR. NATIVIDAD. I am also against this provision which will again chip more powers from the President. In case of other criminals convicted in our society, we extend probation to them while in this case, they have already been convicted and we offer mercy. The only way we can offer mercy to them is through this executive clemency extended to them by the President. If we still close this avenue to them, they would be prejudiced even worse than the murderers and the more vicious killers in our society. I do not think they deserve this opprobrium and punishment under the new Constitution.\n\nI am in favor of the proposed amendment of Commissioner Tan.\n\nMR. ROMULO. We are ready to vote, Madam President.\n\nTHE PRESIDENT. Is this accepted by the Committee?\n\nMR. REGALADO. The Committee, Madam President, prefers to submit this to the floor and also because of the objection of the main proponent, Commissioner Davide. So we feel that the Commissioners should vote on this question.\n\nVOTING\n\nTHE PRESIDENT. As many as are in favor of the proposed amendment of Commissioner Tan to delete the last sentence of Section 17 appearing on lines 7, 8 and 9, please raise their hand. ( Several Members raised their hand .)\n\nAs many as are against, please raise their hand. ( Few Members raised their hand .)\n\nThe results show 34 votes in favor and 4 votes against; the amendment is approved. [30] (Emphases supplied.)\nThe proper interpretation of Articles 36 and 41 of the Revised Penal Code.\n\nThe foregoing pronouncements solidify the thesis that Articles 36 and 41 of the Revised Penal Code cannot, in any way, serve to abridge or diminish the exclusive power and prerogative of the President to pardon persons convicted of violating penal statutes.\n\nThe Court cannot subscribe to Risos-Vidal\u2019s interpretation that the said Articles contain specific textual commands which must be strictly followed in order to free the beneficiary of presidential grace from the disqualifications specifically prescribed by them.\n\nAgain, Articles 36 and 41 of the Revised Penal Code provides:\nART. 36. Pardon; its effects . \u2013 A pardon shall not work the restoration of the right to hold public office, or the right of suffrage, unless such rights be expressly restored by the terms of the pardon .\n\nA pardon shall in no case exempt the culprit from the payment of the civil indemnity imposed upon him by the sentence.\n\nx x x x\n\nART. 41. Reclusion perpetua and reclusion temporal \u2013 Their accessory penalties . \u2013 The penalties of reclusion perpetua and reclusion temporal shall carry with them that of civil interdiction for life or during the period of the sentence as the case may be, and that of perpetual absolute disqualification which the offender shall suffer even though pardoned as to the principal penalty, unless the same shall have been expressly remitted in the pardon . (Emphases supplied.)\nA rigid and inflexible reading of the above provisions of law, as proposed by Risos-Vidal, is unwarranted, especially so if it will defeat or unduly restrict the power of the President to grant executive clemency.\n\nIt is well-entrenched in this jurisdiction that where the words of a statute are clear, plain, and free from ambiguity, it must be given its literal meaning and applied without attempted interpretation. Verba legis non est recedendum . From the words of a statute there should be no departure. [31] It is this Court\u2019s firm view that the phrase in the presidential pardon at issue which declares that former President Estrada \u201cis hereby restored to his civil and political rights\u201d substantially complies with the requirement of express restoration.\n\nThe Dissent of Justice Marvic M.V.F. Leonen agreed with Risos-Vidal that there was no express remission and/or restoration of the rights of suffrage and/or to hold public office in the pardon granted to former President Estrada, as required by Articles 36 and 41 of the Revised Penal Code.\n\nJustice Leonen posits in his Dissent that the aforementioned codal provisions must be followed by the President, as they do not abridge or diminish the President\u2019s power to extend clemency. He opines that they do not reduce the coverage of the President\u2019s pardoning power. Particularly, he states:\nArticles 36 and 41 refer only to requirements of convention or form. They only provide a procedural prescription. They are not concerned with areas where or the instances when the President may grant pardon; they are only concerned with how he or she is to exercise such power so that no other governmental instrumentality needs to intervene to give it full effect.\n\nAll that Articles 36 and 41 do is prescribe that, if the President wishes to include in the pardon the restoration of the rights of suffrage and to hold public office, or the remission of the accessory penalty of perpetual absolute disqualification, he or she should do so expressly. Articles 36 and 41 only ask that the President state his or her intentions clearly, directly, firmly, precisely, and unmistakably. To belabor the point, the President retains the power to make such restoration or remission, subject to a prescription on the manner by which he or she is to state it. [32]\nWith due respect, I disagree with the overbroad statement that Congress may dictate as to how the President may exercise his/her power of executive clemency. The form or manner by which the President, or Congress for that matter, should exercise their respective Constitutional powers or prerogatives cannot be interfered with unless it is so provided in the Constitution. This is the essence of the principle of separation of powers deeply ingrained in our system of government which \u201cordains that each of the three great branches of government has exclusive cognizance of and is supreme in matters falling within its own constitutionally allocated sphere.\u201d [33] Moreso, this fundamental principle must be observed if non-compliance with the form imposed by one branch on a co-equal and coordinate branch will result into the diminution of an exclusive Constitutional prerogative.\n\nFor this reason, Articles 36 and 41 of the Revised Penal Code should be construed in a way that will give full effect to the executive clemency granted by the President, instead of indulging in an overly strict interpretation that may serve to impair or diminish the import of the pardon which emanated from the Office of the President and duly signed by the Chief Executive himself/herself. The said codal provisions must be construed to harmonize the power of Congress to define crimes and prescribe the penalties for such crimes and the power of the President to grant executive clemency. All that the said provisions impart is that the pardon of the principal penalty does not carry with it the remission of the accessory penalties unless the President expressly includes said accessory penalties in the pardon. It still recognizes the Presidential prerogative to grant executive clemency and, specifically, to decide to pardon the principal penalty while excluding its accessory penalties or to pardon both. Thus, Articles 36 and 41 only clarify the effect of the pardon so decided upon by the President on the penalties imposed in accordance with law.\n\nA close scrutiny of the text of the pardon extended to former President Estrada shows that both the principal penalty of reclusion perpetua and its accessory penalties are included in the pardon. The first sentence refers to the executive clemency extended to former President Estrada who was convicted by the Sandiganbayan of plunder and imposed a penalty of reclusion perpetua . The latter is the principal penalty pardoned which relieved him of imprisonment. The sentence that followed, which states that \u201c(h)e is hereby restored to his civil and political rights,\u201d expressly remitted the accessory penalties that attached to the principal penalty of reclusion perpetua . Hence, even if we apply Articles 36 and 41 of the Revised Penal Code, it is indubitable from the text of the pardon that the accessory penalties of civil interdiction and perpetual absolute disqualification were expressly remitted together with the principal penalty of reclusion perpetua .\n\nIn this jurisdiction, the right to seek public elective office is recognized by law as falling under the whole gamut of civil and political rights.\n\nSection 5 of Republic Act No. 9225, [34] otherwise known as the \u201cCitizenship Retention and Reacquisition Act of 2003,\u201d reads as follows:\nSection 5. Civil and Political Rights and Liabilities . \u2013 Those who retain or reacquire Philippine citizenship under this Act shall enjoy full civil and political rights and be subject to all attendant liabilities and responsibilities under existing laws of the Philippines and the following conditions:\n\n(1) Those intending to exercise their right of suffrage must meet the requirements under Section 1, Article V of the Constitution, Republic Act No. 9189, otherwise known as \u201cThe Overseas Absentee Voting Act of 2003\u201d and other existing laws;\n\n(2) Those seeking elective public office in the Philippines shall meet the qualifications for holding such public office as required by the Constitution and existing laws and, at the time of the filing of the certificate of candidacy, make a personal and sworn renunciation of any and all foreign citizenship before any public officer authorized to administer an oath;\n\n(3) Those appointed to any public office shall subscribe and swear an oath of allegiance to the Republic of the Philippines and its duly constituted authorities prior to their assumption of office: Provided , That they renounce their oath of allegiance to the country where they took that oath;\n\n(4) Those intending to practice their profession in the Philippines shall apply with the proper authority for a license or permit to engage in such practice; and\n\n(5) That right to vote or be elected or appointed to any public office in the Philippines cannot be exercised by, or extended to, those who:\n\n(a) are candidates for or are occupying any public office in the country of which they are naturalized citizens; and/or\n\n(b) are in active service as commissioned or noncommissioned officers in the armed forces of the country which they are naturalized citizens. (Emphases supplied.)\nNo less than the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, to which the Philippines is a signatory, acknowledges the existence of said right. Article 25(b) of the Convention states:\nArticle 25\n\nEvery citizen shall have the right and the opportunity, without any of the distinctions mentioned in Article 2 and without unreasonable restrictions:\n\nx x x x\n\n(b) To vote and to be elected at genuine periodic elections which shall be by universal and equal suffrage and shall be held by secret ballot, guaranteeing the free expression of the will of the electors[.] (Emphasis supplied.)\nRecently, in Sobejana-Condon v. Commission on Elections , [35] the Court unequivocally referred to the right to seek public elective office as a political right, to wit:\nStated differently, it is an additional qualification for elective office specific only to Filipino citizens who re-acquire their citizenship under Section 3 of R.A. No. 9225. It is the operative act that restores their right to run for public office. The petitioner\u2019s failure to comply therewith in accordance with the exact tenor of the law, rendered ineffectual the Declaration of Renunciation of Australian Citizenship she executed on September 18, 2006. As such, she is yet to regain her political right to seek elective office . Unless she executes a sworn renunciation of her Australian citizenship, she is ineligible to run for and hold any elective office in the Philippines. (Emphasis supplied.)\nThus, from both law and jurisprudence, the right to seek public elective office is unequivocally considered as a political right. Hence, the Court reiterates its earlier statement that the pardon granted to former President Estrada admits no other interpretation other than to mean that, upon acceptance of the pardon granted to him, he regained his FULL civil and political rights \u2013 including the right to seek elective office.\n\nOn the other hand, the theory of Risos-Vidal goes beyond the plain meaning of said penal provisions; and prescribes a formal requirement that is not only unnecessary but, if insisted upon, could be in derogation of the constitutional prohibition relative to the principle that the exercise of presidential pardon cannot be affected by legislative action.\n\nRisos-Vidal relied heavily on the separate concurring opinions in Monsanto v. Factoran, Jr . [36] to justify her argument that an absolute pardon must expressly state that the right to hold public office has been restored, and that the penalty of perpetual absolute disqualification has been remitted.\n\nThis is incorrect.\n\nHer reliance on said opinions is utterly misplaced. Although the learned views of Justices Teodoro R. Padilla and Florentino P. Feliciano are to be respected, they do not form part of the controlling doctrine nor to be considered part of the law of the land. On the contrary, a careful reading of the majority opinion in Monsanto , penned by no less than Chief Justice Marcelo B. Fernan, reveals no statement that denotes adherence to a stringent and overly nuanced application of Articles 36 and 41 of the Revised Penal Code that will in effect require the President to use a statutorily prescribed language in extending executive clemency, even if the intent of the President can otherwise be deduced from the text or words used in the pardon. Furthermore, as explained above, the pardon here is consistent with, and not contrary to, the provisions of Articles 36 and 41.\n\nThe disqualification of former President Estrada under Section 40 of the LGC in relation to Section 12 of the OEC was removed by his acceptance of the absolute pardon granted to him.\n\nSection 40 of the LGC identifies who are disqualified from running for any elective local position. Risos-Vidal argues that former President Estrada is disqualified under item (a), to wit:\n(a) Those sentenced by final judgment for an offense involving moral turpitude or for an offense punishable by one (1) year or more of imprisonment, within two (2) years after serving sentence[.] (Emphasis supplied.)\nLikewise, Section 12 of the OEC provides for similar prohibitions, but it provides for an exception, to wit:\nSection 12. Disqualifications. \u2013 x x x unless he has been given plenary pardon or granted amnesty . (Emphasis supplied.)\nAs earlier stated, Risos-Vidal maintains that former President Estrada\u2019s conviction for plunder disqualifies him from running for the elective local position of Mayor of the City of Manila under Section 40(a) of the LGC. However, the subsequent absolute pardon granted to former President Estrada effectively restored his right to seek public elective office. This is made possible by reading Section 40(a) of the LGC in relation to Section 12 of the OEC.\n\nWhile it may be apparent that the proscription in Section 40(a) of the LGC is worded in absolute terms, Section 12 of the OEC provides a legal escape from the prohibition \u2013 a plenary pardon or amnesty. In other words, the latter provision allows any person who has been granted plenary pardon or amnesty after conviction by final judgment of an offense involving moral turpitude, inter alia , to run for and hold any public office, whether local or national position.\n\nTake notice that the applicability of Section 12 of the OEC to candidates running for local elective positions is not unprecedented. In Jalosjos, Jr. v. Commission on Elections , [37] the Court acknowledged the aforementioned provision as one of the legal remedies that may be availed of to disqualify a candidate in a local election filed any day after the last day for filing of certificates of candidacy, but not later than the date of proclamation. [38] The pertinent ruling in the Jalosjos case is quoted as follows:\nWhat is indisputably clear is that false material representation of Jalosjos is a ground for a petition under Section 78. However, since the false material representation arises from a crime penalized by prision mayor , a petition under Section 12 of the Omnibus Election Code or Section 40 of the Local Government Code can also be properly filed. The petitioner has a choice whether to anchor his petition on Section 12 or Section 78 of the Omnibus Election Code, or on Section 40 of the Local Government Code. The law expressly provides multiple remedies and the choice of which remedy to adopt belongs to petitioner. [39] (Emphasis supplied.)\nThe third preambular clause of the pardon did not operate to make the pardon conditional.\n\nContrary to Risos-Vidal\u2019s declaration, the third preambular clause of the pardon, i.e. , \u201c [w]hereas, Joseph Ejercito Estrada has publicly committed to no longer seek any elective position or office ,\u201d neither makes the pardon conditional, nor militate against the conclusion that former President Estrada\u2019s rights to suffrage and to seek public elective office have been restored. This is especially true as the pardon itself does not explicitly impose a condition or limitation, considering the unqualified use of the term \u201ccivil and political rights\u201d as being restored.\n\nJurisprudence educates that a preamble is not an essential part of an act as it is an introductory or preparatory clause that explains the reasons for the enactment, usually introduced by the word \u201cwhereas.\u201d [40] Whereas clauses do not form part of a statute because, strictly speaking, they are not part of the operative language of the statute. [41] In this case, the whereas clause at issue is not an integral part of the decree of the pardon, and therefore, does not by itself alone operate to make the pardon conditional or to make its effectivity contingent upon the fulfilment of the aforementioned commitment nor to limit the scope of the pardon.\n\nOn this matter, the Court quotes with approval a relevant excerpt of COMELEC Commissioner Maria Gracia Padaca\u2019s separate concurring opinion in the assailed April 1, 2013 Resolution of the COMELEC in SPA No. 13-211 (DC), which captured the essence of the legal effect of preambular paragraphs/whereas clauses, viz :\nThe present dispute does not raise anything which the 20 January 2010 Resolution did not conclude upon. Here, Petitioner Risos-Vidal raised the same argument with respect to the 3 rd \u201cwhereas clause\u201d or preambular paragraph of the decree of pardon. It states that \u201cJoseph Ejercito Estrada has publicly committed to no longer seek any elective position or office.\u201d On this contention, the undersigned reiterates the ruling of the Commission that the 3 rd preambular paragraph does not have any legal or binding effect on the absolute nature of the pardon extended by former President Arroyo to herein Respondent.\n\nThis ruling is consistent with the traditional and customary usage of preambular paragraphs. In the case of Echegaray v. Secretary of Justice , the Supreme Court ruled on the legal effect of preambular paragraphs or whereas clauses on statutes. The Court stated, viz .:\nBesides, a preamble is really not an integral part of a law. It is merely an introduction to show its intent or purposes. It cannot be the origin of rights and obligations. Where the meaning of a statute is clear and unambiguous, the preamble can neither expand nor restrict its operation much less prevail over its text . If former President Arroyo intended for the pardon to be conditional on Respondent\u2019s promise never to seek a public office again, the former ought to have explicitly stated the same in the text of the pardon itself. Since former President Arroyo did not make this an integral part of the decree of pardon, the Commission is constrained to rule that the 3 rd preambular clause cannot be interpreted as a condition to the pardon extended to former President Estrada. [42] (Emphasis supplied.)\nAbsent any contrary evidence, former President Arroyo\u2019s silence on former President Estrada\u2019s decision to run for President in the May 2010 elections against, among others, the candidate of the political party of former President Arroyo, after the latter\u2019s receipt and acceptance of the pardon speaks volume of her intention to restore him to his rights to suffrage and to hold public office.\n\nWhere the scope and import of the executive clemency extended by the President is in issue, the Court must turn to the only evidence available to it, and that is the pardon itself. From a detailed review of the four corners of said document, nothing therein gives an iota of intimation that the third Whereas Clause is actually a limitation, proviso, stipulation or condition on the grant of the pardon, such that the breach of the mentioned commitment not to seek public office will result in a revocation or cancellation of said pardon. To the Court, what it is simply is a statement of fact or the prevailing situation at the time the executive clemency was granted. It was not used as a condition to the efficacy or to delimit the scope of the pardon.\n\nEven if the Court were to subscribe to the view that the third Whereas Clause was one of the reasons to grant the pardon, the pardon itself does not provide for the attendant consequence of the breach thereof. This Court will be hard put to discern the resultant effect of an eventual infringement. Just like it will be hard put to determine which civil or political rights were restored if the Court were to take the road suggested by Risos-Vidal that the statement \u201c [h]e is hereby restored to his civil and political rights \u201d excludes the restoration of former President Estrada\u2019s rights to suffrage and to hold public office. The aforequoted text of the executive clemency granted does not provide the Court with any guide as to how and where to draw the line between the included and excluded political rights.\n\nJustice Leonen emphasizes the point that the ultimate issue for resolution is not whether the pardon is contingent on the condition that former President Estrada will not seek another elective public office, but it actually concerns the coverage of the pardon \u2013 whether the pardon granted to former President Estrada was so expansive as to have restored all his political rights, inclusive of the rights of suffrage and to hold public office. Justice Leonen is of the view that the pardon in question is not absolute nor plenary in scope despite the statement that former President Estrada is \u201c hereby restored to his civil and political rights ,\u201d that is, the foregoing statement restored to former President Estrada all his civil and political rights except the rights denied to him by the unremitted penalty of perpetual absolute disqualification made up of, among others, the rights of suffrage and to hold public office. He adds that had the President chosen to be so expansive as to include the rights of suffrage and to hold public office, she should have been more clear on her intentions.\n\nHowever, the statement \u201c [h]e is hereby restored to his civil and political rights ,\u201d to the mind of the Court, is crystal clear \u2013 the pardon granted to former President Estrada was absolute, meaning, it was not only unconditional, it was unrestricted in scope, complete and plenary in character, as the term \u201cpolitical rights\u201d adverted to has a settled meaning in law and jurisprudence.\n\nWith due respect, I disagree too with Justice Leonen that the omission of the qualifying word \u201cfull\u201d can be construed as excluding the restoration of the rights of suffrage and to hold public office. There appears to be no distinction as to the coverage of the term \u201cfull political rights\u201d and the term \u201cpolitical rights\u201d used alone without any qualification. How to ascribe to the latter term the meaning that it is \u201cpartial\u201d and not \u201cfull\u201d defies one\u2019s understanding. More so, it will be extremely difficult to identify which of the political rights are restored by the pardon, when the text of the latter is silent on this matter. Exceptions to the grant of pardon cannot be presumed from the absence of the qualifying word \u201cfull\u201d when the pardon restored the \u201cpolitical rights\u201d of former President Estrada without any exclusion or reservation.\n\nTherefore, there can be no other conclusion but to say that the pardon granted to former President Estrada was absolute in the absence of a clear, unequivocal and concrete factual basis upon which to anchor or support the Presidential intent to grant a limited pardon.\n\nTo reiterate, insofar as its coverage is concerned, the text of the pardon can withstand close scrutiny even under the provisions of Articles 36 and 41 of the Revised Penal Code.\n\nThe COMELEC did not commit grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction in issuing the assailed Resolutions.\n\nIn light of the foregoing, contrary to the assertions of Risos-Vidal, the COMELEC did not commit grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction in issuing the assailed Resolutions.\n\nThe Court has consistently held that a petition for certiorari against actions of the COMELEC is confined only to instances of grave abuse of discretion amounting to patent and substantial denial of due process, because the COMELEC is presumed to be most competent in matters falling within its domain. [43]\n\nAs settled in jurisprudence, grave abuse of discretion is the arbitrary exercise of power due to passion, prejudice or personal hostility; or the whimsical, arbitrary, or capricious exercise of power that amounts to an evasion or refusal to perform a positive duty enjoined by law or to act at all in contemplation of law. For an act to be condemned as having been done with grave abuse of discretion, such an abuse must be patent and gross. [44]\n\nThe arguments forwarded by Risos-Vidal fail to adequately demonstrate any factual or legal bases to prove that the assailed COMELEC Resolutions were issued in a \u201cwhimsical, arbitrary or capricious exercise of power that amounts to an evasion or refusal to perform a positive duty enjoined by law\u201d or were so \u201cpatent and gross\u201d as to constitute grave abuse of discretion.\n\nOn the foregoing premises and conclusions, this Court finds it unnecessary to separately discuss Lim\u2019s petition-in-intervention, which substantially presented the same arguments as Risos-Vidal\u2019s petition.\n\nWHEREFORE, the petition for certiorari and petition-in-intervention are DISMISSED . The Resolution dated April 1, 2013 of the Commission on Elections, Second Division, and the Resolution dated April 23, 2013 of the Commission on Elections, En banc , both in SPA No. 13-211 (DC), are AFFIRMED .\n\nSO ORDERED.\n\nSereno, (Chief Justice) , I join the dissent of J.

Specifically, Erap\u2019s pardon contained an express restoration of his rights to vote and to hold public office and an express remission of Erap\u2019s perpetual absolute disqualification brought about by his conviction for plunder. As I will discuss below, these rights are subsumed under the phrase \u201ccivil and political rights\u201d that PGMA expressly restored in Erap\u2019s pardon.\n\nI add that aside from the points discussed by the ponencia , other material legal justifications exist that would support the same conclusion and address the vagueness that Risos-Vidal attributes to the textual language of Erap\u2019s pardon. These legal justifications include an unbiased examination of the third preambular clause of Erap\u2019s pardon, the official definition of \u201cabsolute pardon,\u201d and the pertinent rules on statutory construction that, in instances of doubt, give primacy to the interests of the voters in election cases such as the present case. I shall discuss all these below.\n\nI maintain, too, that despite the ponencia \u2019s resolution of the issue of Erap\u2019s pardon and its effects on his perpetual absolute disqualification, an equally important issue lingers and remains unresolved - whether or not the Commission on Elections (COMELEC) gravely abused its discretion in relying on its 2010 rulings that Erap\u2019s pardon restored his rights to vote and to be voted for a public office .\n\nThis issue is particularly important since the Court\u2019s certiorari jurisdiction is being invoked and the assailed COMELEC rulings are not being questioned specifically on its ruling on the issue of Erap\u2019s pardon but on the COMELEC\u2019s reliance on its 2010 ruling on this particular issue.\n\nThis 2010 disqualification ruling pertained to the consolidated COMELEC Resolution in SPA No. 09-028 (DC) and SPA No. 09-104 (DC), entitled Atty. Evilio C. Pormento v. Joseph Ejercito Estrada and In Re: Petition to Disqualify Estrada Ejercito, Joseph M. From Running As President Due to Constitutional Disqualification and Creating Confusion to the Prejudice of Estrada, Mary Lou B . These cases were filed against Erap when he ran as President of the Philippines in the 2010 elections.\n\nFor clarity, the COMELEC Second Division\u2019s resolution dated April 1, 2013 that is being questioned in the present case states: \u201c Today, this Commission is confronted with a controversy that is far from novelty. Albeit raised by another petitioner, the issue raised in the present case is glaringly similar to or intertwined with the issues involved in the consolidated resolution for SPA No. 09-028 (DC) and SPA No. 09-104 (DC). Therefore, it cannot be gainsaid that the question of whether or not the pardon granted to respondent has restored his right to run for public office, which was curtailed by virtue of his conviction for plunder that carries with it the penalty of perpetual absolute disqualification, has been passed upon and ruled out by this Commission way back in 2010 ... Having taken judicial cognizance of the consolidated resolution for SPA No. 09-028 (DC) and SPA No. 09-104 (DC) and the 10 May 2010 En Banc resolution affirming it, this Commission will not belabor the controversy further. More so, petitioner failed to present cogent proof sufficient to reverse the standing pronouncement of this Commission declaring categorically that respondent\u2019s right to seek public office has been effectively restored by the pardon vested upon him by former President Gloria M. Arroyo. Since this Commission has already spoken, it will no longer engage in disquisitions of a settled matter lest indulged in wastage of government resources .\u201d\n\nThis COMELEC Second Division ruling was upheld by the COMELEC en banc in its Resolution dated April 23, 2013, which is also being assailed in the present case.\n\nI stress that the above 2013 COMELEC rulings that are sought to be nullified in the present case did not explicitly rule on the issue of Erap\u2019s pardon but merely relied on the 2010 COMELEC rulings on this particular issue. According to Risos-Vidal, this \u201creliance\u201d constituted grave abuse of discretion.\n\nTo my mind, in the exercise of the Court\u2019s certiorari jurisdiction, the issue of whether or not the COMELEC gravely abused its discretion in relying on its 2010 rulings on Erap\u2019s pardon should be squarely ruled upon on the merits, especially because Risos-Vidal and the parties raised this particular issue in the present case.\n\nAnother crucial issue that must be resolved, in view of its jurisprudential repercussions, is the legal propriety of Alfredo S. Lim\u2019s ( Lim ) intervention in the present case.\n\nI discuss all these issues below.\n\nI.\n\nPrefatory Statement\n\nBefore this Court is an election disqualification case involving a candidate (and subsequent winner) in the 2013 elections. By their nature, disqualification cases are not unusual; in our political system they are given free rein because they affect voters\u2019 choice and governance.\n\nWhat distinguishes this case is the basis for the objection - the executive clemency (or as interchangeably used in this Opinion, the pardon ) previously granted by the former President of the Republic Gloria Macapagal Arroyo to her immediate predecessor, respondent President Joseph Ejercito Estrada, whom the former replaced under extraordinary circumstances.\n\nAt issue is not the validity of the pardon as this issue has not been raised; at issue (to be decided in the context of the presence or absence of grave abuse of discretion by the COMELEC) are the intepretation of the terms of the pardon and the grantor\u2019s intent , a matter that \u2013 in the absence of direct evidence from grantor PGMA \u2013 the Court has to discern from the pardon\u2019s written terms. Intertwined with this issue is the question of whether or not the COMELEC gravely abused its discretion in dismissing the Risos-Vidal petition based on its 2010 ruling that Erap\u2019s pardon restored his rights to vote and to be voted for a public office.\n\nThus, we are largely left with the task of interpreting the terms of the pardon that a politician granted to another politician, for the application of its terms to a dispute in a political setting \u2013 the elections of 2013. This characterization of the present case, however, should not change nor affect the Court\u2019s mode of resolution: the Constitution only allows us to adjudicate on the basis of the law, jurisprudence and established legal principles.\n\nUnder this approach, the Court should also be aware that beyond the direct parties, another party \u2013 the formally unnamed and unimpleaded electorate \u2013 has interests that the Court should take into account. The electorate has a continuing stake in this case because they participated and expressed their choice in the 2013 elections ; in fact, not one of the entities that could have prevented them from voting \u2013 the COMELEC and this Court \u2013 acted to prevent Erap from being voted upon .\n\nTheir participation, to my mind, brings into the picture the need to consider and apply deeper democratic principles: while the voters are generally the governed, they are at the same time the sovereign who decides how and by whom they are to be governed. This step is particularly relevant in the present case since the electorate\u2019s unquestioned preference was Erap, the recipient of the disputed pardon .\n\nI recite all these as they are the underlying considerations I shall take into account in this Separate Opinion.\n\nAside from points of law, I also take into account the interests of the voters. These interests, in my view, should not only be considered but given weight and even primacy , particularly in a situation of doubt.\n\nII.\n\nThe Roots of the Present Case\n\nA. The Early Roots: The Plunder and the Pardon .\n\nThe present case traces its roots to respondent Erap\u2019s term as President of the Philippines which started at noon of June 30, 1998. He relinquished his post in the middle of his term and was thereafter charged with the crime of Plunder. [1] The Sandiganbayan convicted him on September 12, 2007 and imposed on him the penalty of reclusion perpetua and its accessory penalties.\n\nOn October 25, 2007, former President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo ( PGMA ) granted Erap executive clemency under terms that in part provides:\nIN VIEW HEREOF and pursuant to the authority conferred upon me by the Constitution, I hereby grant executive clemency to JOSEPH EJERCITO ESTRADA, convicted by the Sandiganbayan of Plunder and imposed a penalty of Reclusion Perpetua. He is hereby restored to his civil and political rights . [Emphasis supplied]\nErap accepted the pardon without qualifications on October 26, 2007.\n\nB. Erap\u2019s 2010 Presidential Candidacy & Disqualification Cases .\n\nOn November 30, 2009, Erap filed his Certificate of Candidacy (CoC) for the position of President of the Philippines.\n\nHis candidacy immediately drew a trilogy of cases that were filed on or about the same time, with the intent of disqualifying him from running as President and from holding office if he would win.\n\nThe first was a petition to cancel and deny due course to Estrada\u2019s CoC [SPA 09-024 (DC)] [2] filed by Elly Velez B. Lao Pamatong ( Pamatong ). PGMA was also impleaded as a respondent. Pamatong alleged that Erap could not validly run for the presidency because of the constitutional ban against re-election; he also claimed that PGMA was also prohibited from running for any elective public office, even as a representative of the 2 nd district of Pampanga. Pamatong also argued in his position paper that Erap\u2019s pardon was not absolute as it was conditioned on his promise not to run for any public office. [3]\n\nThe second formal objection to Erap\u2019s presidential candidacy came from Evilio C. Pormento ( Pormento ) who filed his \u201c Urgent Petition for Disqualification as Presidential Candidate \u201d on December 5, 2009 (docketed as SPA 09-028 ). Pormento alleged that Erap was not eligible for re-election for the position of President pursuant to Article VII, Section 4 of the Constitution. In his answer to Pormento , Erap re-pleaded his defenses in the Pamatong case and added that the grant of executive clemency in his favor removed all legal impediments that might bar his candidacy for the presidency. [4]\n\nThe third objection was filed by Mary Lou Estrada , a presidential candidate, who filed a petition for disqualification and cancellation of Erap\u2019s CoC based on the grounds that he was not eligible for re-election and that Erap\u2019s candidacy would confuse the electorate, to her prejudice. This case was docketed as SPA 09-104 .\n\nThe COMELEC, Second Division, called the trilogy to a joint hearing but opted to issue separate but simultaneous decisions because the Pamatong case, SPA 09-024, involved PGMA as a second respondent, while the two other cases [docketed as SPA Nos. 09-028 (DC) and 09-104 (DC)] only involved Erap as the respondent. Significantly, while three separate decisions were issued, they all commonly discussed, practically using the same wording , the pardon extended to Erap and concluded that the pardon restored Erap\u2019s \u201c right to vote and to be voted for a public office .\u201d [5]\n\nB.1. The Disqualification Rulings in the 2010 Election Cases .\n\nThus, in clear and explicit terms, the Resolutions in all three cases uniformly ruled that Erap was not disqualified from running and from holding office, not only because he was not running for re-election, but likewise because of the pardon that had been extended to him.\n\nThe COMELEC specifically ruled that the statement in the pardon stating that \u2013 \u201c Whereas, Joseph Estrada has publicly committed to no longer seek any elective position or office \u201d \u2013 was not really a condition but was merely a part of the pardon\u2019s preliminary statement. The dispositive portion of the pardon did not state that it was conditioned on this purported public commitment. Additionally, his public statement cannot serve to restrict the operation of, or prevail over, the explicit statement in the pardon that restored all his civil and political rights, including the right to vote and to be voted for a public office. [6]\n\nPetitioner Mary Lou Estrada pointedly questioned the COMELEC rulings in her motion for reconsideration, including the terms of the pardon extended to Erap. [7] Before the 2010 elections took place, the COMELEC en banc adopted the Second Division ruling and denied all the motions. [8] Only Pormento responded to the denial by filing a petition for certiorari before the Court, docketed as G.R. No. 191988.\n\nIn resolving Pormento \u2019s petition, the Court solely touched on the issue of \u201cre-election\u201d and held that there was no longer any justiciable issue to be resolved because Erap had already lost the 2010 elections. Thus, the Court dismissed the whole petition, observing that Erap fully participated in the elections since Pormento did not pray for the issuance of a TRO.\n\nPamatong and Mary Lou Estrada did not pursue further remedies after the COMELEC en banc denied their respective motions for reconsideration. This Court, on the other hand, dismissed Pormento \u2019s Rules 64/65 petition assailing the COMELEC ruling. Thus, the COMELEC ruling in the three cases became final, executory, non-appealable and non-assailable . [9]\n\nAs I will discuss below, these final COMELEC decisions on Erap\u2019s pardon and his resulting qualification to run for elective public office preclude this same issue of pardon from again being questioned because res judicata has already set in.\n\nSignificantly, when voting took place on May 10, 2010, no prohibition was in place to prevent the voters from voting for Erap as a candidate. Neither the COMELEC (because it had dismissed the petitions against Erap\u2019s candidacy) nor this Court (because it did not issue any temporary restraining order or injunction) prevented Erap from being voted upon . In a field of ten (10) candidates, Erap garnered 9,487,837 votes and landed in second place, as against the winner\u2019s 15,208,678 votes. [10]\n\nIII.\n\nThe Risos-Vidal Petition\n\nOn October 2, 2012, Erap filed his Certificate of Candidacy ( CoC ) for the position of City Mayor of Manila. As had happened in the past, this Erap move did not go unchallenged.\n\nA. The COMELEC Petition .\n\nPetitioner Risos-Vidal filed on January 24, 2013 \u2013 or before the 2013 elections \u2013 a petition for disqualification against private respondent Erap based on Section 40 [11] of the Local Government Code (R.A. No. 7160, the LGC) in relation with Section 12 [12] of the Omnibus Election Code (B.P. No. 881, the OEC ). Both the LGC and the OEC commonly disqualify any person convicted of an offense involving moral turpitude from running for office.\n\nShe sought to disqualify Erap from running for mayor for having been convicted of a crime involving moral turpitude (plunder), an offense that carries the penalty of reclusion perpetua and the accessory penalties of interdiction and perpetual absolute disqualification. She alleged that Erap\u2019s subsequent pardon was conditional and did not cover the accessory penalty of perpetual absolute disqualification.\n\nRisos-Vidal and Erap fully argued the pardon aspect of the case before the COMELEC and before the Court. In Risos-Vidal\u2019s Memorandum that she submitted to the Court, she attached as Annex \u201cE\u201d the COMELEC Memorandum of Erap with the attached Pamatong, [13] Pormento [14] and Mary Lou Estrada [15] COMELEC resolutions.\n\nB. The COMELEC Ruling .\n\nOn April 1, 2013 or 42 days before the 2013 elections, the COMELEC Second Division dismissed the petition for disqualification, citing its 2010 rulings in the cases filed against Erap after he filed his CoC for the position of President of the Philippines in 2010. According to the COMELEC, it had already ruled in these disqualification cases and had then held that the pardon granted to Erap was absolute and unconditional; hence, his previous conviction no longer barred him from running for an elective public office.\n\nThe COMELEC en banc denied Risos-Vidal\u2019s motion for reconsideration, [16] prompting her to file the present petition for certiorari , where she alleged that the COMELEC gravely abused its discretion in issuing the assailed COMELEC resolutions. [17]\n\nWhile the petition was pending before the Court, the 2013 elections took place. Neither the COMELEC nor this Court barred Erap from running and being voted upon. He obtained 349,770 votes and was proclaimed as the \u201cduly elected\u201d Mayor on May 14, 2013. His opponent, Lim, obtained 313,764 votes and conceded that Erap had won. [18]\n\nC. The Lim Intervention .\n\nOn June 7, 2013 \u2013 i.e. , after the 2013 elections; Erap\u2019s proclamation as elected Mayor; his concession of the elections to Erap; and while the present petition was pending before the Court \u2013 Lim (Erap\u2019s opponent in the mayoralty race) filed a motion for leave to intervene, which motion the Court granted in a Resolution dated June 25, 2013.\n\nIV.\n\nThe Issues for Resolution\n\nThe main issue in this case is whether the COMELEC committed GRAVE ABUSE OF DISCRETION in ruling that Erap had been extended a PARDON that qualified him to run for City Mayor of Manila in the 2013 elections .\n\nInterrelated with this issue is the question of whether or not the COMELEC committed GRAVE ABUSE OF DISCRETION in dismissing the Risos-Vidal petition based on the 2010 COMELEC rulings that Erap\u2019s pardon restored his rights to vote and to be voted for a public office.\n\nClosely related to these main issues is the question of whether \u2013 based on the voting circumstances that surrounded the 2010 and 2013 elections \u2013 equitable reasons exist that should now prevent the Court from declaring Erap ineligible for the position to which he had been elected by the majority of Manila voters.\n\nCentral to these issues is the determination of the nature and effects of the pardon granted to Erap, as well as the effects of all the developments in the case on the electorate \u2013 the innocent third party whose exercise of the democratic right to vote underlies the present dispute.\n\nA tangential side issue that should be settled for its jurisprudential value is the legal propriety of the intervention of Alfredo S. Lim only at the Supreme Court level.\n\nOther subsidiary issues must necessarily be resolved to get at the main and side issues. They shall all be topically identified in the course of resolving the leading issues.\n\nV.\n\nMy Separate Opinion\n\nA. Preliminary Considerations .\n\nA.1. The Standard of Review in Considering the present petition .\n\nIn the review of the COMELEC\u2019s ruling on the Risos-Vidal petition, an issue that we must settle at the outset is the nature and extent of the review we shall undertake. This determination is important so that everyone \u2013 both the direct parties as well as the voting public \u2013 will know and understand how this case was decided and that the Court had not engaged in any kind of \u201coverreach.\u201d\n\nSection 7, Article IX of the Constitution provides that \u201cunless otherwise provided by this Constitution or by law, any decision, order or ruling of each Commission may be brought to the Supreme Court on certiorari by the aggrieved party.\u201d A similar provision was found in the 1973 Constitution.\n\nIn Aratuc v. COMELEC (a 1979 case) [19] the Court clarified that unlike in the 1935 Constitution where the Court had the power of review over the decisions, orders and rulings of the COMELEC, [20] the 1973 Constitution changed the nature of this remedy from appellate review to certiorari .\n\nAratuc explained that under the then existing Constitution and statutory provisions, the certiorari jurisdiction of the Court over orders, and decisions of the COMELEC was not as broad as it used to be and should be confined to instances of grave abuse of discretion amounting to patent and substantial denial of due process. [21]\n\nThe Court further observed that these constitutional, statutory and jurisprudential changes show the definite intent to enhance and invigorate the role of the COMELEC as the independent constitutional body tasked to safeguard free, peaceful and honest elections . In other words, the limited reach and scope of certiorari , compared with appellate review, direct that utmost respect be given the COMELEC as the constitutional body given the charge of elections. [22]\n\nA.1(a) Certiorari v. Appeal .\n\nAn appellate review includes the full consideration of the merits, demerits and errors of judgment in the decision under review, while certiorari deals exclusively with the presence or absence of grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack of jurisdiction that rendered the assailed decision or ruling a nullity ; such kind of abuse is way beyond mere error in the assailed judgment or ruling, and is not necessarily present in a valid but erroneous decision.\n\nA.1(b) Grave Abuse of Discretion .\n\nThe grave abuse of discretion that justifies the grant of certiorari involves a defect of jurisdiction brought about, among others, by an indifferent disregard for the law, arbitrariness and caprice, an omission to weigh pertinent considerations, or a decision arrived at without rational deliberation [23] - due process issues that rendered the decision or ruling void .\n\nOur 1987 Constitution maintained the same remedy of certiorari in the review of COMELEC decisions elevated to the Supreme Court as the Constitutional Convention deliberations show. [24] This constitutional provision has since then been reflected under Rules 64 and 65 of the Rules of Court.\n\nAside from the jurisdictional element involved, another basic and important element to fully understand the remedy of certiorari , is that it applies to rulings that are not, or are no longer, appealable . Thus, certiorari is not an appeal that opens up the whole case for review; it is limited to a consideration of a specific aspect of the case, to determine if grave abuse of discretion had intervened.\n\nFor example, it is a remedy that may be taken against an interlocutory order (or one that does not resolve the main disputed issue in the case and is thus not a final order on the merits of the case) that was issued with grave abuse of discretion. This is the remedy to address a denial of a bill of particulars [25] or of the right to bail [26] by the trial court in a criminal case. It is also the sole remedy available against a COMELEC ruling on the merits of a case as this ruling on the main disputed issue is considered by the Constitution and by the law to be final and non-appealable. [27]\n\nA.1(c) Application of the Stardards of Review to the COMELEC Ruling .\n\nTo assail a COMELEC ruling, the assailing party must show that the final and inappealable ruling is void, not merely erroneous , because the COMELEC acted with grave abuse of discretion in considering the case or in issuing its ruling.\n\nUnder our established jurisprudence, this grave abuse of discretion has been almost uniformly defined as a \"capricious or whimsical exercise of judgment as is equivalent to lack of jurisdiction.\" The abuse of discretion, to be grave, must be so patent and gross as to amount to an \"evasion of a positive duty or to a virtual refusal to perform a duty enjoined by law, or to act at all in contemplation of law, as where the power is exercised in an arbitrary and despotic manner by reason of passion and hostility.\"\n\nThe present Erap case is an election case brought from a ruling of the COMELEC en banc to this Court as an independent action for certiorari under Rule 64 in relation with Rule 65 of the Rules of Court , and must perforce be judged under the above-discussed standards.\n\nThe question before us is not simply whether the COMELEC erred in appreciating the nature of the pardon granted to Erap and in relying on its 2010 rulings on this matter; the question to ask is, even if the COMELEC did err , whether its error is to the point of grave abuse of discretion .\n\n1. The Interests of the Electorate .\n\nAs I narrated above, the Erap story did not end with his crime and conviction. While he had undeniably committed a crime involving betrayal of the public trust, he was subsequently and lawfully pardoned for his misdeed. While jurisprudence may be divided on the effects of pardon ( i.e. whether it erases both the guilt and the penalty), the various cases giving rise to this jurisprudence do not appear to have considered at all the election setting that presently confronts us.\n\nWhere the crime from which the guilt resulted is not unknown and was in fact a very widely publicized event in the country when it happened, the subsequent electoral judgment of the people on the recipient of the executive clemency cannot and should not be lightly disregarded. People participation is the essence of democracy and we should be keenly aware of the people\u2019s voice and heed it to the extent that the law does not bar this course of action. In case of doubt , the sentiment that the people expressed should assume primacy.\n\nWhen the recipient of pardon is likewise the people\u2019s choice in an election held after the pardon, it is well to remember that pardon is an act of clemency and grace exercised to mitigate the harshness of the application of the law and should be understood in this spirit, i.e. , in favor of the grantee whom the people themselves have adjudged and found acceptable.\n\nIt ought not be forgotten that in two high profile elections, the State had allowed Erap to offer himself as a candidate without any legal bar and without notice to the voting public that a vote for him could be rendered useless and stray .\n\nIn the 2010 presidential elections, he had offered himself as a presidential candidate and his candidacy was objected to, among others, because of the nature of the pardon extended to him. The COMELEC resolved the objection and he was voted upon without any formal notice of any legal bar to his candidacy. It is now a matter of record and history that he landed 2 nd in these elections, in a field of ten (10) candidates, with 9,487,837 voting for him as against the winner who garnered 15,208,678 votes. To Erap\u2019s credit, he gracefully accepted his electoral defeat. [28]\n\nIn 2013, he again ran for office. He won this time but a case was again filed against him with the COMELEC and the case eventually reached this Court. This is the present case.\n\nThe COMELEC cleared Erap by election day of 2013, dismissing the disqualification case against him and ruling that the pardon granted to him restored his right to vote and to be voted upon. Notably, even this Court did not prevent Erap\u2019s candidacy and did not prevent him from being voted upon after his disqualification case was brought to this Court. Thus, the people went to the polls and voted Erap into office with no expectation that their votes could be rendered stray .\n\nUnder these circumstances, we cannot and should not rashly rule on the basis of black letter law and jurisprudence that address only the fact of pardon; we cannot forget the election setting and simply disregard the interests of the voters in our ruling. While the people were not impleaded as direct parties to the case, we cannot gloss over their interests as they are the sovereign who cannot be disregarded in a democratic state like ours.\n\n2. The Intervention of former Mayor Alfredo S. Lim .\n\nI have included the intervention of former Mayor Alfredo S. Lim as a matter for Preliminary Consideration as it is an immaterial consideration under my position that the COMELEC did not gravely abuse its discretion in its assailed ruling. Despite its immateriality, I nevertheless discuss it in light of the Court\u2019s prior action approving his intervention, which court approval was an interlocutory order that is subject to the Court\u2019s final ruling on the merits of the case.\n\nI have to discuss the intervention, too, for jurisprudential reasons : this intervention, apparently granted without indepth consideration, may sow confusion into the jurisprudence that those who came before us in this Court took pains to put in order.\n\n2.a. Intervention in General .\n\nIntervention is a remedy whereby a third party, not originally impleaded in the proceedings, becomes a litigant in the case so that the intervenor could protect or preserve a right or interest that may be affected by the proceedings.\n\nThe intervenor\u2019s interest must be actual, substantial, material, direct and immediate, and not simply contingent or expectant . It must be of such direct and immediate character that the intervenor will either gain or lose by the direct legal operation and effect of the judgment.\n\nAs discussed below, there are also other equally important limitations and restrictions to consider before an intervention can be allowed, among them, the need for the intervention to be timely filed.\n\n2.b. The context of Lim\u2019s intervention .\n\nThe timing and incidents of Lim\u2019s intervention are jurisprudentially interesting and, by themselves, speak loudly against his cause.\n\nThe records of this case show that Lim never filed any petition to cancel Erap\u2019s CoC nor to disqualify him. Neither did he intervene in the COMELEC proceedings in the Risos-Vidal petition. Instead, Lim allowed Erap to continue as his rival candidate in the 2013 elections for Mayor of the City of Manila.\n\nIt will be recalled that Risos-Vidal filed her petition for certiorari before this Court on April 30, 2013 (or before the May 13, 2013 elections). Lim likewise did not intervene at that point. Erap won in the elections and in fact, on May 14, 2013, Lim publicly announced that he respected and acknowledged the COMELEC\u2019s proclamation of Erap and wished him all the best. [29]\n\nOn June 7, 2013 (25 days after the May 13, 21013 elections, or 24 days after Erap\u2019s proclamation, and 24 days likewise after Lim conceded victory to Erap), Lim then filed with this Court his motion for leave to intervene with the attached petition-in-intervention. His arguments were: 1) Erap was disqualified to run for public office as his pardon did not restore his rights to vote and to hold public office; [30] and 2) his intervention was still timely.\n\nLim also argued that it would have been premature to intervene in the Risos-Vidal petition before the proclamation because had Erap\u2019s votes not then been counted, they would have been considered stray and intervention would have been unnecessary. Lim further argued that, in view of Erap\u2019s disqualification, he should be declared as the winner, having obtained the second highest number of votes. Lim also additionally alleged that he never conceded defeat, and the COMELEC committed grave abuse of discretion when it dismissed Risos-Vidal\u2019s petition for disqualification based on its 2010 rulings. [31]\n\n2.c. Lim\u2019s petition-in-intervention should be dismissed .\n\nSince Lim intervened only in the present petition for certiorari before this Court, the Rules of Court on intervention directly applies. Section 2, Rule 19 of the Rules of Court provides that the time to intervene is at any time before the rendition of judgment by the trial court.\n\nThe Court explained in Ongco v. Dalisay [32] that \u201c the period within which a person may intervene is restricted and after the lapse of the period set in Section 2, Rule 19, intervention will no longer be warranted. This is because, basically, intervention is not an independent action but is ancillary and supplemental to an existing litigation .\u201d\n\nIn Ongco , [33] the Court further traced the developments of the present rule on the period to file a motion for intervention. The former rule was that intervention may be allowed \"before or during a trial.\" Thus, there were Court rulings that a motion for leave to intervene may be filed \"before or during a trial,\" even on the day when the case is submitted for decision as long as it will not unduly delay the disposition of the case. [34] There were also rulings where the Court interpreted \u201ctrial\u201d in the restricted sense such that the Court upheld the denial of the motion for intervention when it was filed after the case had been submitted for decision. [35] In Lichauco v. CA , [36] intervention was allowed at any time after the rendition of the final judgment. [37] In one exceptional case, [38] the Court allowed the intervention in a case pending before it on appeal in order to avoid injustice.\n\nTo cure these inconsistent rulings, the Court clarified in Ongco that \u201c[t]he uncertainty in these rulings has been eliminated by the present Section 2, Rule 19, which permits the filing of the motion to intervene at any time before the rendition of the judgment, in line with the ruling in Lichauco . [39]\n\nThe justification for this amendment is that before judgment is rendered, the court, for good cause shown, may still allow the introduction of additional evidence as this is still within a liberal interpretation of the period for trial. Also, since no judgment has yet been rendered, the matter subject of the intervention may still be readily resolved and integrated in the judgment disposing of all claims in the case, without requiring an overall reassessment of these claims as would be the case if the judgment had already been rendered. [40]\n\nThe Court held in Ongco that under the present rules, [t]he period within which a person may intervene is also restricted\u2026 after the lapse of this period, it will not be warranted anymore. This is because, basically, intervention is not an independent action but is ancillary and supplemental to an existing litigation . [41]\n\nThe Court further held in Ongco that \u201cthere is wisdom in strictly enforcing the period set by Rule 19 of the Rules of Court for the filing of a motion for intervention. Otherwise, undue delay would result from many belated filings of motions for intervention after judgment has already been rendered, because a reassessment of claims would have to be done. Thus, those who slept on their lawfully granted privilege to intervene will be rewarded, while the original parties will be unduly prejudiced.\u201d [42]\n\nWhile the Court may have liberally relaxed the rule on intervention in some cases, a liberal approach cannot be made in the present case because of jurisdictional restrictions, further explained below.\n\nOther than these reasons, I add that under COMELEC rules , only \u201c a person allowed to initiate an action or proceeding may, before or during the trial of an action or proceeding, be permitted by the Commission, in its discretion, to intervene in such action or proceeding, if he has legal interest in the matter in litigation, or in the success of either of the parties, or an interest against both, or when he is so situated as to be adversely affected by such action or proceeding .\u201d Thus, Lim could have intervened at the COMELEC level before or during the hearing of the petition for disqualification that Risos-Vidal filed.\n\nThe records show that Lim intervened only after Risos-Vidal filed the present petition for certiorari with the Court and not during the disqualification proceedings before the COMELEC. He was therefore never a party in the disqualification proceeding before the COMELEC and, consequently, has not presented any evidence to support his claims; nor was Erap ever given the chance to controvert Lim\u2019s claims before the COMELEC, the tribunal vested with the jurisdiction to settle the issues that he raised in his petition-in-intervention before the Court .\n\nFrom the perspective of Rule 65 of the Rules of Court , I add that because Lim was not a party before the COMELEC, he never had the chance to file a motion for reconsideration before that body \u2013 a constitutional and procedural requirement before a petition for certiorari may be filed before the Court . [43] As a non-party to the disqualification case before the COMELEC, he cannot be deemed an \u201c aggrieved party \u201d who has earned the rights under Rule 65 to file a certiorari petition or to intervene to assail the COMELEC\u2019s decision. The Court, in particular, has no jurisdiction to grant the prayer of Lim to be declared as the winner, especially since the COMELEC never had the chance to rule on this in its assailed decision.\n\nThe original jurisdiction to decide election disputes lies with the COMELEC, not with this Court. [44] Thus, any ruling from us in the first instance on who should sit as mayor (in the event we grant the Risos-Vidal petition) will constitute grave abuse of discretion. Unfortunately, no recourse is available from our ruling. This character of finality renders it very important for us to settle the Lim intervention correctly.\n\nAt this juncture, I refer back to Ongco , where the Court held that the filing of a motion for intervention with the CA after the MTC had rendered judgment is an inexcusable delay and is a sufficient ground for denying a motion for intervention. [45]\n\nNote that in Ongco , the Court still upheld the CA\u2019s denial of the motion for intervention and strictly applied the period to intervene even if what was involved was an appeal or a continuation of the proceedings of the trial court.\n\nIn contrast, the present case is not a continuation of the COMELEC proceedings and decision, but an original special civil action of certiorari . Thus, with more reason should the rules on intervention be more stringently applied, given too that the Court has no original jurisdiction over the issues involved in the requested intervention, in particular, over the issue of who should sit as Mayor of the City of Manila if Risos-Vidal petition would be granted.\n\nAs my last two points on the requested intervention, I would deny the intervention even if it technically satisfies the rules by reason of the estoppel that set in when Lim publicly announced that he was acknowledging and respecting Erap\u2019s proclamation. This public announcement is an admission against his interest that, in a proper case, would be admissible against Lim.\n\nI also disregard outright, for lack of relevance, the cases that Lim cited regarding intervention. In his cited Maquiling v. COMELEC [46] and Aratea v. COMELEC [47] cases, the intervenors filed their intervention before the COMELEC and not before the Court. Thus, any reliance on these cases would be misplaced.\n\nIn sum, I maintain that Lim should be barred from participating in the present case as intervenor. Otherwise, the Court will effectively throw out of the window the jurisprudence that has developed on intervention, while disregarding as well the sound and applicable COMELEC rules on the same topic.\n\nVI.\n\nThe Merits of the Petition\n\nA.\n\nOn the Issue of Pardon and the COMELEC\u2019s Grave Abuse of Discretion .\n\nThe COMELEC did not err at all and thus could not have committed grave abuse of discretion in its ruling that the terms of Erap\u2019s pardon restored to him the right to vote and to be voted upon. Too, the COMELEC did not gravely abuse its discretion in dismissing the petition of Risos-Vidal and in citing its 2010 final and executory rulings that Erap\u2019s pardon restored his right to vote and be voted upon.\n\nA.1. Pardoning Power and the Pardon Extended .\n\nSection 19, Article VII of the Constitution provides for the pardoning power of the President. It states that except in cases of impeachment, or as otherwise provided in this Constitution , the President may grant reprieves, commutations, and pardons, and remit fines and forfeitures, after conviction by final judgment.\n\nPardon is defined as an act of grace, proceeding from the power entrusted with the execution of the laws, which exempts the individual, on whom it is bestowed, from the punishment that the law inflicts for a crime he has committed. [48]\n\nThe power to pardon, when exercised by the Chief Executive in favor of persons convicted of public crimes, is plenary, limited only by the terms of the Constitution; its exercise within these limits is otherwise absolute and fully discretionary. The reasons for its exercise are not open to judicial inquiry or review, and indeed it would appear that he may act without any reason, or at least without any expressed reason, in support of his action. [49]\n\nWhere appropriate, however, his acts may be subject to the expanded jurisdiction of the Court under Article VIII, Section 1, paragraph 2 of the Constitution. This jurisdiction may be triggered, for example, if the President acts outside, or in excess, of the limits of the pardoning power granted him, as when he extends a pardon for a crime as yet not committed or when he extends a pardon before conviction. [50]\n\nLlamas v. Orbos , [51] a 1991 case, discussed the extent and scope of the President\u2019s pardoning power:\nDuring the deliberations of the Constitutional Commission, a subject of deliberations was the proposed amendment to Art. VII, Sec. 19 which reads as follows: \u201cHowever, the power to grant executive clemency for violation of corrupt practices laws may be limited by legislation .\u201d The Constitutional Commission, however, voted to remove the amendment, since it was in derogation of the powers of the President. As Mr. Natividad stated:\nI am also against this provision which will again chip more powers from the President. In case of other criminals convicted in our society we extend probation to them while in this case, they have already been convicted and we offer mercy. The only way we can offer mercy to them is through this executive clemency extended to them by the President. If we still close this avenue to them, they would be prejudiced even worse than the murderers and the more vicious killers in our society x x x.\nThe proposal was primarily intended to prevent the President from protecting his cronies. Manifestly, however, the Commission preferred to trust in the discretion of Presidents and refrained from putting additional limitations on his clemency powers. (II RECORD of the Constitutional Commission, 392, 418-419, 524-525)\n\nIt is evident from the intent of the Constitutional Commission, therefore, that the President's executive clemency powers may not be limited in terms of coverage, except as already provided in the Constitution, that is, \"no pardon, amnesty, parole, or suspension of sentence for violation of election laws, rules and regulations shall be granted by the President without the favorable recommendation of the COMELEC\" (Article IX, C, Section 5, Constitution). If those already adjudged guilty criminally in court may be pardoned, those adjudged guilty administratively should likewise be extended the same benefit. [Emphasis supplied]\nIn considering and interpreting the terms of the pardon therefore, the starting point for analysis is the position that the President\u2019s power is full and plenary, save only for the textual limits under the Constitution. In the exercise of this power , too, it is not unreasonable to conclude, in the absence of any plain and expressed contrary intention, that the President exercised the full scope of his power.\n\nA.2. Structural Examination of the Erap Pardon .\n\nThe whole text of the pardon that PGMA granted states:\nWHEREAS, this Administration has a policy of releasing inmates who have reached the age of seventy (70),\n\nWHEREAS, Joseph Ejercito Estrada has been under detention for six and half years,\n\nWHEREAS, Joseph Ejercito Estrada has publicly committed to no longer seek any elective position or office,\n\nIN VIEW HEREOF and pursuant to the authority conferred upon me by the Constitution, I hereby grant executive clemency to JOSEPH EJERCITO ESTRADA, convicted by the Sandiganbayan of Plunder and imposed a penalty of Reclusion Perpetua. He is hereby restored to his civil and political rights.\n\nThe forfeitures imposed by the Sandiganbayan remain in force and in full, including all writs and processes issued by the Sandiganbayan in pursuance hereof, except for the bank account(s) he owned before his tenure as President.\n\nUpon acceptance of this pardon by JOSEPH EJERCITO ESTRADA, this pardon shall take effect.\nStructurally, this grant is composed of two parts, namely, the introductory Whereas Clauses consisting of three (3) paragraphs, and the Dispositive or Command portion which defines the clemency extended and commands its implementation.\n\nIn issuing a pardon, the President not only exercises his full discretion but likewise directs and gives notice to all \u2013 the recipient, the officials and entities concerned \u2013 that the recipient should now be released and his disqualification lifted, pursuant to the terms of the pardon. In this sense, the structure of the written pardon assumes importance as pardon has to be implemented in accordance with its express terms and is no different in this sense from a judicial decision that likewise must be implemented.\n\nIn judicial decisions, the Court\u2019s resolution on a given issue before it is always embodied in the decision or order\u2019s fallo or dispositive portion. [52] It is the directive part of the decision or order which must be enforced or, in legal parlance, subjected to execution. A court that issues an order of execution contrary to the terms of its final judgment exceeds its jurisdiction, thus rendering its order invalid. [53] Hence, the order of execution should always follow the terms of the fallo or dispositive portion.\n\nOther than the fallo , a decision or executory order contains a body \u2013 the court\u2019s opinion \u2013 explaining and discussing the decision. This opinion serves as the reason for the decision or order embodied in the fallo . In legalese, this opinion embodies the decision\u2019s ratio decidendi [54] or the matter or issue directly ruled upon and the terms and reasons for the ruling.\n\nThe decision\u2019s structure has given rise in certain instances to conflicts, or at the very least, to ambiguities that clouded the implementation of the decision. In Gonzales v. Solid Cement Corporation , [55] this Court laid down the rule when these instances occur: in a conflict between the body of the decision and its fallo or dispositive portion, the rule is:\nThe resolution of the court in a given issue \u2013 embodied in the fallo or dispositive part of a decision or order \u2013 is the controlling factor in resolving the issues in a case . The fallo embodies the court\u2019s decisive action on the issue/s posed, and is thus the part of the decision that must be enforced during execution. The other parts of the decision only contain, and are aptly called, the ratio decidendi (or reason for the decision) and, in this sense, assume a lesser role in carrying into effect the tribunal\u2019s disposition of the case.\n\nWhen a conflict exists between the dispositive portion and the opinion of the court in the text or body of the decision, the former must prevail over the latter under the rule that the dispositive portion is the definitive order, while the opinion is merely an explanatory statement without the effect of a directive. Hence, the execution must conform with what the fallo or dispositive portion of the decision ordains or decrees. [56] [Emphasis supplied]\nThus, the body of the decision (or opinion portion) carries no commanding effect; the fallo or dispositive portion carries the definite directive that prevails over whatever is written in the opinion of the court. The body contains the reasons or conclusions of the court, but orders nothing; execution springs from the fallo or dispositive portion, not from the decision\u2019s body or opinion portion. In short, the fallo or dispositive portion prevails in case of conflict.\n\nI say all these, aware that in Cobarrubias v. People , [57] the Court made an exception to the general rule that the fallo or dispositive portion always prevails over the decision or order\u2019s body. The exception is when one can clearly and unquestionably conclude, based on the body of the decision and its discussions, that a mistake had been committed in formulating the dispositive portion. In such cases, reason dictates that the body of the decision should prevail. [58]\n\nThis contrary Cobarrubias result, to be properly understood, must be read and considered in its factual context. In this case, the court itself made a blatant mistake in the dispositive portion as it mixed up the criminal docket case numbers, thus resulting in the erroneous dismissal of the wrong criminal case. Since the decision\u2019s body very clearly discussed which criminal case should be dismissed, the Court then held that the body should prevail over the dispositive portion. In other words, when the decision\u2019s intent is beyond doubt and is very clear but was simply beclouded by an intervening mistake, then the body of the decision must prevail.\n\nA pardon, as an expression of an executive policy decision that must be enforced, hews closely to the structure of a court decision. Their structures run parallel with each other, with the Whereas Clauses briefly stating the considerations recognized and, possibly, the intents and purposes considered, in arriving at the directive to pardon and release a convicted prisoner.\n\nThus, while a pardon\u2019s introductory or Whereas Clauses may be considered in reading the pardon (in the manner that the opinion portion of a court decision is read), these whereas clauses \u2013 as a rule \u2013 cannot also significantly affect the pardon\u2019s dispositive portion. They can only do so and in fact may even prevail , but a clear and patent reason indicating a mistake in the grantor\u2019s intent must be shown, as had happened in Cobarrubias where a mistake intervened in the fallo .\n\nA.3. The Pardon Extended to Erap Examined .\n\nA.3(a) The Decision Convicting Erap .\n\nTo fully understand the terms of the granted executive clemency, reference should be made to the September 12, 2007 decision of the Sandiganbayan which states:\nWHEREFORE, in view of all the foregoing, judgment is hereby rendered in Criminal Case No. 26558 finding the accused, Former President Joseph Ejercito Estrada, GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of PLUNDER, defined in and penalized by Republic Act No. 7080, as amended. On the other hand, for failure of the prosecution to prove and establish their guilt beyond reasonable doubt, the Court finds the accused Jose \u201cJinggoy\u201d Estrada and Atty. Edward S. Serapio NOT GUILTY of the crime of plunder and, accordingly, the Court hereby orders their ACQUITTAL.\n\nThe penalty imposable for the crime of plunder under Republic Act No. 7080, as amended by Republic Act No. 7659, is Reclusion Perpetua to Death . There being no aggravating or mitigating circumstances, however, the lesser penalty shall be applied in accordance with Article 63 of the Revised Penal Code. Accordingly, the accused Former President Joseph Ejercito Estrada is hereby sentenced to suffer the penalty of Reclusion Perpetua and the accessory penalties of civil interdiction during the period of sentence and perpetual absolute disqualification.\n\nThe period within which accused Former President Joseph Ejercito Estrada has been under detention shall be credited to him in full as long as he agrees voluntarily in writing to abide by the same disciplinary rules imposed upon convicted prisoners.\n\nMoreover, in accordance with Section 2 of Republic Act No. 7080, as amended by Republic Act No. 7659, the Court hereby declares the forfeiture in favor of the government of the following:\n\n(1) The total amount of Five Hundred Forty Two Million Seven Hundred Ninety One Thousand Pesos (P545,291,000.00), with interest and income earned, inclusive of the amount of Two Hundred Million Pesos (P200,000,000.00), deposited in the name and account of the Erap Muslim Youth Foundation.\n\n(2) The amount of One Hundred Eighty Nine Million Pesos (P189,000,000.00), inclusive of interests and income earned, deposited in the Jose Velarde account.\n\n(3) The real property consisting of a house and lot dubbed as Boracay Mansion located at #100 11th Street, New Manila, Quezon City.\n\nThe cash bonds posted by accused Jose Jinggoy Estrada and Atty. Edward S. Serapio are hereby ordered cancelled and released to the said accused or their duly authorized representatives upon presentation of the original receipt evidencing payment thereof and subject to the usual accounting and auditing procedures. Likewise, the hold-departure orders issued against the said accused are hereby recalled and declared functus officio.\n\nSO ORDERED.\nA.3(b) The Pardon in light of the Judgment of Conviction .\n\nThis judgment has several components, namely: the finding of guilt; the principal penalty of imprisonment imposed; the inherent accessory penalties; the confiscation and forfeitures; and the disposition of the cash bonds that the acquitted accused filed.\n\nOf these, actions on the forfeitures and the cash bonds have apparently been recognized as completed pursuant to Article 45 of the RPC, and have been expressly excluded from the executive clemency. [59] Thus, what remained for the executive clemency to touch upon were the principal and the accessory penalties that were outstanding, i.e. , the remaining terms of the imprisonment; and the accessory penalties decreeing that Erap is \u201c restored to his civil and political rights .\u201d\n\nB.\n\nThe Risos-Vidal\u2019s\nObjections Relating to Pardon .\n\nThe Risos-Vidal petition sows confusion into the plain terms of the executive clemency by arguing that: first , the Third Whereas Clause (referring to Erap\u2019s public commitment that he would no longer seek public office) in fact embodies a condition for the grant of the executive clemency; and second , no express restoration of the right to hold public office and to suffrage was made as the \u201crestoration\u201d was under general terms that did not cover these specific rights.\n\nB.1. Refutation of the Risos-Vidal Objections .\n\nB.1(a) \u201cAbsolute Pardon\u201d as Officially Defined .\n\nA ready reference to understand a pardon is its official definition under the applicable law and applicable rules and regulations. The definition of absolute pardon appears in the rules and regulations of the Board of Pardons and Parole ( BPP ). [60] The BPP is the constituent office in the Executive Department [61] responsible for the handling of cases of pardon upon petition, or any referral by the Office of the President on pardons and parole, or motu propio . [62] In other words, the BPP is the foremost authority on what its title plainly states \u2013 pardons and paroles.\n\nUnder the BPP\u2019s Revised Rules and Regulations, \u201cabsolute pardon\u201d refers \u201cto the total extinction of the criminal liability of the individual to whom it is granted without any condition. It restores to the individual his civil and political rights and remits the penalty imposed for the particular offense of which he was convicted.\u201d [63]\n\nAside from absolute pardon, there is the conditional pardon [64] which is defined as \u201c the exemption of an individual, within certain limits or conditions, from the punishment which the law inflicts for the offense he had committed resulting in the partial extinction of his criminal liability .\u201d\n\nThese are the authoritative guidelines in determining the nature and extent of the pardon the President grants, i.e. , whether it is absolute or conditional. To stress, the BPP is the body that investigates and recommends to the President whether or not a pardon should be granted to a convict, and that closely coordinates with the Office of the President on matters of pardons and parole.\n\nEven a cursory examination of the Erap pardon and the BPP Rules would show that the wordings of the pardon, particularly on civil and political rights, carried the wordings of the BPP Rules. Thus, Erap\u2019s pardon states:\nIN VIEW HEREOF, and pursuant to the authority conferred upon me by the Constitution, I hereby grant executive clemency to JOSEPH EJERCITO ESTRADA, convicted by the Sandiganbayan of Plunder and imposed a penalty of Reclusion Perpetua. He is hereby restored to his civil and political rights.\nIn these lights, when PGMA (as President and Head of the Executive Department to which the BPP belongs) granted Erap executive clemency and used the words of the BPP rules and regulations, she raised the inference that her grant was in the spirit in which the terms of the pardon are understood in the BPP rules .\n\nIn other words, she clearly intended the granted pardon to be absolute. Thus, the pardon granted totally extinguished the criminal liability of Erap, including the accessory penalty of perpetual absolute disqualification . It cannot be otherwise under the plain and unequivocal wording of the definition of absolute pardon, and the statement in the pardon that Erap is restored to his civil and political rights .\n\nB.2. The Third Whereas Clause as a Condition .\n\nThe pardon extended to Erap was very briefly worded. After three short Whereas Clauses referring to: the Administration policy on the release of inmates; [65] the period Erap had been under detention; [66] and Erap\u2019s attributed past statement publicly committing that he would \u201cno longer seek any elective position, [67] the pardon proceeds to its main directives touching on the principal penalty of reclusion perpetua and the accessory penalties by expressly restoring Erap\u2019s civil and political rights.\n\nUnlike in a court decision where the ratio decidendi fully expounds on the presented issues and leads up to the dispositive portion, the Whereas Clauses all related to Erap but did not, singly or collectively, necessarily indicate that they are conditions that Erap must comply with for the continued validity of his pardon.\n\nNotably, the first two Whereas Clauses are pure statements of fact that the grantor recognized, referring as they do to an administration policy and to the age of Erap.\n\nThe statement on the administration policy of releasing convicts who are 70 years old, to be sure, could not have been intended to be conditional so that a future change of policy or a mistake in Erap\u2019s age would have led to the invalidity of the pardon. Purely and simply, these two Whereas clauses were nothing more than statements of fact that the grantor recognized in the course of considering the pardon and they were never intended to operate as conditions.\n\nThe third Whereas Clause , one of the three clauses that the pardon contains, is similarly a statement of fact \u2013 what Erap had publicly committed in the past, i.e. , that he would no longer seek public office. Such a statement would not be strange coming from a 70-year-old man convicted of plunder and sentenced to reclusion perpetua (literally, life imprisonment) and who, in the ordinary course, looks forward to an extended prison term. Under these conditions, he could easily say he would not seek political office again.\n\nOf course, because the statement, standing by itself, can be equivocal, it can also be read with a bias against Erap and be understood to be a promise or a \u201ccommitment.\u201d The plain reality, however, is that this clause does not bear the required context that would lead to this conclusion, and is totality lacking in any indicator that would make it a condition for the pardon. In short, a clear link to this kind of conclusion is plainly missing.\n\nThis link, for example, would have been there and would have radically changed the meaning of this Whereas clause had it stated that Erap publicly committed that, if pardoned , he would not seek public office. No such link, however, appears in the body of the pardon, nor is any evidence available from the records of the case, to show that a promissory commitment had been made and adopted by PGMA, as grantor.\n\nThus, as matters stand, the third Whereas clause stands in the same footing and should be characterized in the same manner that the two other clauses are characterized: singly or collectively, they are simply declarations of what the grantor recognized as facts at the time the pardon was granted. In the manner the Court spoke of preambles in the case of Kuwait Airways Corporation v. Philippine Airlines, Inc. , [68] the Whereas clauses merely manifest considerations that cannot be the origin of rights and obligations [69] and cannot make the Erap pardon conditional.\n\nSimply as an aside (as I feel the topic does not deserve any extended consideration), I do not believe that the \u201cacceptance\u201d of the pardon is important in the determination of whether the pardon extended is absolute or conditional.\n\nIrrespective of the nature of the pardon, the moment the convict avails of the clemency granted, with or without written acceptance, then the pardon is already accepted. If this is to be the standard to determine the classification of the pardon, then there would hardly be any absolute pardon; upon his release, the pardon is deemed accepted and therefore conditional.\n\nIf an express acceptance would serve a useful purpose at all, it is in the binding effect that this acceptance would put in place. As in the case of an appointment, a pardon can be withdrawn at any time before it is accepted by the grantor. Acceptance would thus be the means to tie the grantor to the grant.\n\nWhat is important, to my mind, is proof of the communication of the pardon to the convict, in the cases when terms and conditions are attached to the pardon. Communications of these terms, and proof that the convict availed himself of the granted clemency, would suffice to conclude that the terms and conditions had been accepted and should be observed.\n\nB.3. Any Doubt Should Take Popular Vote into Account .\n\nAt most, I can grant in a very objective reading of the bare terms of the third Whereas clause that it can admit of various interpretations. Any interpretative exercise, however, in order to be meaningful and conclusive must bring into play relevant interpretative aids, even those extraneous to the pardon, such as the events that transpired since the grant of the pardon. This case, in particular, the most relevant interpretative aids would be the two elections where Erap had been a candidate, the electorate\u2019s choices, and the significant number who voted in good faith to elect Erap.\n\nIn 2010, this number was sizeable but Erap only landed in second place with a vote of 9,487,837 in a field of ten (10) candidates. This result though cannot but be given appropriate recognition since the elections were nationwide and Erap\u2019s conviction and pardon were issues used against him.\n\nIn the 2013 elections (where Erap\u2019s qualification is presently being contested), the results were different; he garnered sufficient votes to win, beating the incumbent in this electoral fight for the premiere post in the City of Manila.\n\nUnder these circumstances, no reason exists to disregard the popular vote, given that it is the only certain determinant under the uncertainty that petitioner Risos-Vidal NOW TRIES to introduce in the present case . If this is done and the popular vote is considered together with the official definition of pardon under the BPP regulations, the conclusion cannot but be the recognition by this Court that Erap had been given back his right to vote and be voted upon.\n\nB.3(a) The Express Restoration of the Right to Hold Office .\n\nThe petitioner Risos-Vidal in her second substantive objection posits that the pardon did not expressly include the right to hold office, relying on Article 36 of the RPC that provides:\nPardon; its effects. \u2013 A pardon shall not work on the restoration of the right to hold public office or the right of suffrage, unless such rights be expressly restored by the terms of the pardon.\nTo the petitioner, it was not sufficient that under the express terms of the pardon , Erap had been \u201crestored to his civil and political rights.\u201d Apparently, she wanted to find the exact wording of the above-quoted Article 36 or, as stated in her various submissions, that Erap should be restored to his \u201cfull\u201d civil and political rights.\n\nTo set the records straight, what is before us is not a situation where a pardon was granted without including in the terms of the pardon the restoration of civil and political rights . What is before us is a pardon that expressly and pointedly restored these rights ; only, the petitioner wants the restoration in her own terms.\n\nIn raising this objection, the petitioner apparently refuses to accept the official definition of \u201cabsolute pardon\u201d pointed out above; she also fails or refuses to grasp the full import of what the term \u201ccivil and political rights\u201d connotes. The term traces its roots to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights [70] which in turn traces its genesis to the same process that led to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights to which the Philippines is a signatory. [71]\n\nCloser to home, Republic Act No. 9225 ( The Citizenship Retention and Reacquisition Act of 2003 ) also speaks of \u201cCivil and Political Rights and Liabilities\u201d in its Section 5 by providing that \u201c Those who retain or re-acquire Philippine citizenship under this Act shall enjoy full civil and political rights and be subject to all the attendant liabilities and responsibilities under existing laws of the Philippines \u2026\u201d and in Section 5(5) mentions the \u201c right to vote and be elected or appointed to any public office in the Philippines x x x .\u201d\n\nIn Simon v. Commission on Human Rights , [72] the Court categorically explained the rights included under the term \u201ccivil and political rights,\u201d in the context of Section 18, Article XIII of the Constitution which provides for the Commission on Human Rights\u2019 power to investigate all forms of human rights violations involving civil and political rights .\u201d\n\nAccording to Simon , the term \u201ccivil rights,\u201d 31 has been defined as referring (t)o those (rights) that belong to every citizen of the state or country, or, in wider sense, to all its inhabitants, and are not connected with the organization or administration of the government. They include the rights of property, marriage, equal protection of the laws, freedom of contract, etc. or, as otherwise defined, civil rights are rights appertaining to a person by virtue of his citizenship in a state or community. Such term may also refer, in its general sense, to rights capable of being enforced or redressed in a civil action. Also quite often mentioned are the guarantees against involuntary servitude, religious persecution, unreasonable searches and seizures, and imprisonment for debt. [73]\n\nPolitical rights , on the other hand, refer to the right to participate, directly or indirectly, in the establishment or administration of government, the right of suffrage, the right to hold public office , the right of petition and, in general, the rights appurtenant to citizenship vis-a-vis the management of government. [74]\n\nIn my view, these distinctions and enumerations of the rights included in the term \u201ccivil and political rights,\u201d [75] as accepted internationally and domestically, are sufficiently clear and cannot be made the serious basis of the present objection, i.e. , that further specification should be made in light of Article 36 of the RPC that requires the restoration of the rights of the right to suffrage and to hold office to be express. To insist on this argument is to require to be written into the pardon what is already there, in the futile attempt to defeat the clear intent of the pardon by mere play of words.\n\nB.3(a)(i) The RPC Perspectives .\n\nFrom the perspective of the RPC, it should be appreciated, as discussed above, that a conviction carries penalties with varying components. These are mainly the principal penalties and the accessory penalties. [76]\n\nReclusion perpetua , the penalty imposed on Erap, carries with it the accessory penalty of civil interdiction for life or during the period of the sentence and that of perpetual absolute disqualification which the offender shall suffer even though pardoned as to the principal penalty, unless the same shall have been remitted in the pardon . [77]\n\nThe full understanding of the full practical effects of pardon on the principal and the accessories penalties as embodied in the RPC, requires the combined reading of Articles 36 and 41 of the RPC, with Article 41 giving full meaning to the requirement of Article 36 that the restoration of the right to hold office be expressly made in a pardon if indeed this is the grantor\u2019s intent. An express mention has to be made of the restoration of the rights to vote and be voted for since a pardon with respect to the principal penalty would not have the effect of restoring these specific rights unless their specific restoration is expressly mentioned in the pardon.\n\nThe Erap\u2019s pardon sought to comply with this RPC requirement by specifically stating that he was \u201crestored to his civil and political rights.\u201d I take the view that this restoration already includes the restoration of the right to vote and be voted for as these are rights subsumed within the \u201cpolitical rights\u201d that the pardon mentions; in the absence of any express accompanying reservation or contrary intent, this formulation grants a full restoration that is coterminous with the remitted principal penalty of reclusion perpetua .\n\nRisos-Vidal objects to this reading of Article 36 on the ground that Section 36 [78] and 41 [79] expressly require that the restoration be made specifically of the right to vote and to be voted upon. J. Leonen supports Risos-Vidal\u2019s arguments and opines that civil and political rights collectively constitute a bundle of rights and the rights to vote and to be voted upon are specific rights expressly singled out and required by these RPC articles and thus must be expressly restored. It posits too that these are requirements of form that do not diminish the pardoning power of the President.\n\nI note in this juncture that J. Leonen\u2019s position on the requirements of Articles 36 and 41, is a very literal reading of 80-year old provisions [80] whose interpretations have been overtaken by events and should now be updated . As I discussed above, technical meanings have since then attached to the term \u201ccivil and political rights,\u201d which meanings cannot be disregarded without doing violence to the safeguards that these rights have acquired over the years.\n\nIn this age and time, \u201cpolitical rights\u201d cannot be understood meaningfully as rights with core values that our democratic system protects, if these rights will not include the right to vote and be voted for. To exclude the rights of suffrage and candidacy from the restoration of civil and political rights shall likewise signify a diminution, other than what the Constitution allows, of the scope of pardon that the President can extend under the 1987 Constitution. Significantly, this Constitution itself did not yet exist when the Revised Penal Code was passed so that this Code could not have taken into account the intent of the framers of this Constitution to maintain the plenary nature of the pardoning power. [81]\n\nB.3(a)(ii) Harmonization of Conflicting Provisions .\n\nWhere seeming conflicts appear between or among provisions of law, particularly between a constitutional provision and a statute, the primary rule in understanding these seeming conflicts is to harmonize them, giving effect to both provisions within the limits of the constitutional provision . [82]\n\nAs posed in this case, this seeming conflict occurs between the terms and intent of the current Constitution to give the President the full power to grant executive clemency, limited only by the terms of the Constitution itself, on the one hand, and the collective application of the Articles 36 and 41 of the RPC, on the other.\n\nIn my view, harmonization occurs under the Erap pardon by giving due recognition to the essentially plenary nature of the President\u2019s pardoning power under Section 19, Article VII of the Constitution, while giving effect to the RPC intent to make clear in the terms of the pardon the intent to restore the convict\u2019s rights to vote and to be voted upon, as a matter of form that is satisfied by reference to the restoration of political rights that, as now understood internationally and domestically, include the restoration of the right to vote and to be voted upon. Understood in this manner, the RPC provisions would not be constitutionally infirm as they would not diminish the pardoning power of the President.\n\nTo address another concern that J. Leonen expressed, no need exists to require the President to grant the \u201cfull\u201d restoration of Erap\u2019s civil and political rights as this kind of interpretation renders illusory the extent of the President\u2019s pardoning power by mere play of words. In the absence of any contrary intent, the use of the modifier \u201cfull\u201d is an unnecessary surplusage.\n\nB.3(a)(iii) The Monsanto v. Factoran Case .\n\nI also address J. Leonen\u2019s discussion of the Monsanto v. Factoran case.\n\nPart and parcel of the topic \u201c RPC Perspectives \u201d is the position that J. Leonen took in Monsanto \u2013 in the course of repudiating Cristobal v. Labrador , [83] Pelobello v. Palatino [84] and Ex Parte Garland . [85] J. Leonen took notice of the statement in Monsanto that \u201c[t]he better considered cases regard full pardon x x x as relieving the party from all the punitive consequences of his criminal act, including the disqualification or disabilities based on finding of guilt.\u201d J. Leonen went on to state that this \u201cincluding phrase or inclusion\u201d is not an authority in concluding that the grant of pardon ipso facto remits the accessory disqualifications or disabilities imposed on a convict regardless of whether the remission was explicitly stated, [86] citing the following reasons:\n\nFirst, J. Leonen maintains that the inclusion was not a pronouncement of a prevailing rule but was merely a statement made in the course of a comparative survey of cases during which the Court manifested a preference for \u201cauthorities [that reject] the unduly broad language of the Garland case.\u201d [87]\n\nSecond, the footnote to the inclusion indicates that Monsanto relied on a case decided by a United States court. Thus, Monsanto was never meant as a summation of the controlling principles in this jurisdiction and did not consider Articles 36 and 41 of the RPC.\n\nLastly, J. Leonen argues that even granting that the inclusion articulated a rule, this inclusion, made in 1989, must be deemed to have been abandoned, in light of the Court\u2019s more recent pronouncements - in 1997, in People v. Casido , [88] and in 2000, in People v. Patriarca [89] - which cited with approval this Court\u2019s statement in Barrioquinto v. Fernandez . [90]\n\nJ. Leonen added that the Monsanto inclusion must also be deemed superseded by the Court\u2019s ruling in Romeo Jalosjos v. COMELEC [91] which recognized that \u201cone who is previously convicted of a crime punishable by reclusion perpetua or reclusion temporal continues to suffer the accessory penalty of perpetual absolute disqualification even though pardoned as to the principal penalty, unless the accessory penalty shall have been expressly remitted in the pardon.\u201d\n\nI disagree with these positions, particularly with the statement that the Monsanto inclusion was overturned by Casido, Patriarca ( citing Barrioquinto ) and Romeo Jalosjos .\n\nI maintain that the inclusion was the ratio decidendi of the case and was not just a passing statement of the Court. In Monsanto , the Court emphasized that a pardon may remit all the penal consequences of a criminal indictment. [92] The Court even applied this statement by categorically ruling that the full pardon granted to Monsanto \u201chas resulted in removing her disqualification from holding public employment.\u201d [93] In fact, J. Leonen\u2019s interpretation of Monsanto is misleading; his conclusion on the superiority of Casido, Patriarca and Jalosjos over Monsanto is likewise misplaced and without basis.\n\nFor clarity, the inclusion phrase is part of the Court\u2019s discussion in Monsanto and was made in the context that although the Court repudiated the Garland ruling (as cited in Pellobello and Cristobal ) that pardon erases the guilt of the convict, the Court still acknowledged that pardon may remove all the punitive consequences of a convict\u2019s criminal act, including the disqualifications or disabilities based on the finding of guilt . [94]\n\nThe complete discussion of the Court in Monsanto where J. Leonen selectively lifted the inclusion for his own purposes is as follows: [95]\nHaving disposed of that preliminary point, we proceed to discuss the effects of a full and absolute pardon in relation to the decisive question of whether or not the plenary pardon had the effect of removing the disqualifications prescribed by the Revised Penal Code .\n\nx x x x\n\nThe Pelobello v. Palatino and Cristobal v. Labrador cases, and several others show the unmistakable application of the doctrinal case of Ex Parte Garland , whose sweeping generalizations to this day continue to hold sway in our jurisprudence despite the fact that much of its relevance has been downplayed by later American decisions. Consider the following broad statements:\nA pardon reaches both the punishment prescribed for the offense and the guilt of the offender; and when the pardon is full, it releases the punishment and blots out of existence the guilt, so that in the eye of the law the offender is as innocent as if he had never committed the offense. If granted before conviction, it prevents any of the penalties and disabilities, consequent upon conviction, from attaching; if granted after conviction, it removes the penalties and disabilities and restores him to all his civil rights; it makes him, as it were, a new man, and gives him a new credit and capacity.\nSuch generalities have not been universally accepted, recognized or approved. The modern trend of authorities now rejects the unduly broad language of the Garland case (reputed to be perhaps the most extreme statement which has been made on the effects of a pardon). To our mind, this is the more realistic approach. While a pardon has generally been regarded as blotting out the existence of guilt so that in the eye of the law the offender is as innocent as though he never committed the offense, it does not operate for all purposes. The very essence of a pardon is forgiveness or remission of guilt. Pardon implies guilt. It does not erase the fact of the commission of the crime and the conviction thereof. It does not wash out the moral stain. It involves forgiveness and not forgetfulness.\n\nThe better considered cases regard full pardon (at least one not based on the offender's innocence) as relieving the party from all the punitive consequences of his criminal act, including the disqualifications or disabilities based on the finding of guilt . But it relieves him from nothing more. \"To say, however, that the offender is a \"new man\", and \"as innocent as if he had never committed the offense;\" is to ignore the difference between the crime and the criminal. A person adjudged guilty of an offense is a convicted criminal, though pardoned; he may be deserving of punishment, though left unpunished; and the law may regard him as more dangerous to society than one never found guilty of crime, though it places no restraints upon him following his conviction.\u201d\n\nx x x x\n\nIn this ponencia , the Court wishes to stress one vital point: While we are prepared to concede that pardon may remit all the penal consequences of a criminal indictment if only to give meaning to the fiat that a pardon, being a presidential prerogative, should not be circumscribed by legislative action, we do not subscribe to the fictitious belief that pardon blots out the guilt of an individual and that once he is absolved, he should be treated as if he were innocent. For whatever may have been the judicial dicta in the past, we cannot perceive how pardon can produce such \"moral changes\" as to equate a pardoned convict in character and conduct with one who has constantly maintained the mark of a good, law-abiding citizen.\n\nx x x x\n\nPardon granted after conviction frees the individual from all the penalties and legal disabilities and restores him to all his civil rights. But unless expressly grounded on the person's innocence (which is rare), it cannot bring back lost reputation for honesty, integrity and fair dealing. This must be constantly kept in mind lest we lose track of the true character and purpose of the privilege.\n\nThus, notwithstanding the expansive and effusive language of the Garland case, we are in full agreement with the commonly-held opinion that pardon does not ipso facto restore a convicted felon to public office necessarily relinquished or forfeited by reason of the conviction although such pardon undoubtedly restores his eligibility for appointment to that office.\n\nx x x x\n\nFor petitioner Monsanto, this is the bottom line: the absolute disqualification or ineligibility from public office forms part of the punishment prescribed by the Revised Penal Code for estafa thru falsification of public documents. It is clear from the authorities referred to that when her guilt and punishment were expunged by her pardon, this particular disability was likewise removed. Henceforth, petitioner may apply for reappointment to the office which was forfeited by reason of her conviction. And in considering her qualifications and suitability for the public post, the facts constituting her offense must be and should be evaluated and taken into account to determine ultimately whether she can once again be entrusted with public funds. Stated differently, the pardon granted to petitioner has resulted in removing her disqualification from holding public employment but it cannot go beyond that . To regain her former post as assistant city treasurer, she must re-apply and undergo the usual procedure required for a new appointment. [Emphasis and underscoring supplied; citations omitted]\nAs against J. Leonen\u2019s interpretation of the Monsanto ruling above, I deduce the following contrary points:\n\nFirst , contrary to J. Leonen\u2019s statement, the Court took into consideration the provisions of the RPC in arriving at its ruling in Monsanto.\n\nTo reiterate, Monsanto exhaustively discussed the effects of a full and absolute pardon on the accessory penalty of disqualification. Hence, the Court ruled that the full pardon granted to Monsanto resulted in removing her disqualification from holding public employment under the RPC but did not result in her automatic reinstatement as Assistant City Treasurer due to the repudiation of the Garland ruling cited in Pelobello and Labrador .\n\nIn contrast, the ruling of the Court in Casido [96] and Patriarca , [97] which both cited Barrioquinto , [98] all related to amnesty and not to pardon. The paragraph in Casido and Patriarca that J. Leonen quoted to contradict the Monsanto inclusion is part of the Court\u2019s attempt in Casido and Patriarca to distinguish amnesty from pardon.\n\nFor clarity, below is the complete paragraph in Casido [99] and Patriarca [100] where J. Leonen lifted the portion (highlighted in bold) that he used to contradict the Monsanto inclusion :\nThe theory of the respondents, supported by the dissenting opinion, is predicated on a wrong contention of the nature or character of an amnesty. Amnesty must be distinguished from pardon.\n\nPardon is granted by the Chief Executive and as such it is a private act which must be pleaded and proved by the person pardoned, because the courts take no notice thereof; while amnesty by Proclamation of the Chief Executive with the concurrence of Congress, and it is a public act of which the courts should take judicial notice. Pardon is granted to one after conviction; while amnesty is to classes of persons or communities who may be guilty of political offenses, generally before or after the institution of the criminal prosecution and sometimes after conviction . Pardon looks forward and relieves the offender from the consequences of an offense of which he has been convicted, that is, it abolishes or forgives the punishment, and for that reason it does \"nor work the restoration of the rights to hold public office, or the right of suffrage, unless such rights be expressly restored by the terms of the pardon,\" and it \"in no case exempts the culprit from the payment of the civil indemnity imposed upon him by the sentence\" (article 36, Revised Penal Code). While amnesty looks backward and abolishes and puts into oblivion the offense itself, it so overlooks and obliterates the offense with which he is charged that the person released by amnesty stands before the law precisely as though he had committed no offense. [101] [Emphasis supplied]\nAs between Monsanto , involving a full pardon, and the three amnesty cases ( Casido, Patriarca and Barrioquinto ), Monsanto clearly applies to the pardon that is involved in the present case where the dispositive portion made a restoration of Erap\u2019s civil and political rights. Note that the pardon described in the amnesty cases does not even identify whether the pardon being described was absolute or conditional. In fact, the portion cited by the majority in the amnesty cases merely repeated what Article 36 of the RPC provides. Monsanto , on the other hand and to the contrary, took into consideration these RPC provisions on disqualifications in relation with the effects of a full pardon.\n\nFrom this perspective, J. Leonen is thus careless and misleading in immediately concluding that the Monsanto ruling on \u201cinclusion\u201d was overturned by the amnesty cases.\n\nSimilarly, contrary to J. Leonen\u2019s argument, the ruling in Romeo Jalosjos v. COMELEC (Jalosjos) did not supersede the Monsanto ruling cited above.\n\nIn Jalosjos , [102] the Court merely reconciled the apparent conflict between Section 40(a) [103] of the Local Government Code and Article 30 [104] of the RPC, which provides for the effects of perpetual or temporary absolute disqualification.\n\nThe Court held in Jalosjos that Article 41 of the RPC expressly states that one who was previously convicted of a crime punishable by reclusion perpetua or reclusion temporal continues to suffer the accessory penalty of perpetual absolute disqualification even though pardoned as to the principal penalty, unless this accessory penalty had been expressly remitted in the pardon. In Jalosjos , the accessory penalty had not been expressly remitted in the Order of Commutation or by any subsequent pardon; hence, Jalosjos\u2019 disqualification to run for elective office was deemed to subsist. [105]\n\nJalosjos could be harmonized with Monsanto in that the latter also recognized the provisions of the RPC on the accessory penalty of disqualification but holds that the full pardon remits this disqualification.\n\nIn the present case, Erap\u2019s pardon fully complied with the RPC requirements for the express remission of the accessory penalty of perpetual absolute disqualification as the pardon in fact restored him to his civil and political rights. In this light, the Monsanto ruling still applies: while the PGMA pardon does not erase Erap\u2019s guilt, it nonetheless remitted his disqualification to run for public office and to vote as it expressly restored him to his civil and political rights.\n\nThe Office of the Solicitor General succinctly expressed the Monsanto ratio decidendi when it said that the Court, despite ruling against Monsanto, \u201cnevertheless reaffirmed the well-settled doctrine that the grant of pardon also removes one\u2019s absolute disqualification or ineligibility to hold public office.\u201d\n\nB.3(b) Arguments via the Interpretative Route .\n\nAlternatively, if indeed the third Whereas clause had injected doubt in the express and unequivocal restoration made, then two interpretative recourses can be made to determine how this doubt can be resolved.\n\nB.3(b)(i) The Liberal Mode of Interpretation .\n\nThe first approach is to use by analogy the ruling and reasoning in the case of Frank v. Wolfe [106] which involved commutation of sentence, a lesser grant but which is an act of grace nevertheless.\n\nThe Court held in this case that \u201c it is a principle universally recognized that all such grants are to the construed favorably to the grantee, and strictly as to the grantor, not only because they partake of the nature of a deed, and the general rule of interpretation that the terms of a written instrument evidencing with especial force to grants or pardon and commutations , wherein the grantor executes the instrument with little or no right on the part of the grantee to intervene in its execution or dictate its terms, but because of the very nature of the grant itself as an act of grace and clemency. (Bishop Crim. Law, sec. 757, and cases cited: Osborn v. U.S. , 91 U.S. 474; Lee v. Murphy , 22 Grat. Va., 789.) Applying the rule we think that, if it had been the intention of the commuting authority to deprive the prisoner of the beneficent provisions of Act No. 1533, [107] language should have been used and would have been used which would leave no room for doubt as to its meaning, and would make clearly manifest the object intended.\u201d\n\nThis approach, read with the plain meaning rule of statutory interpretation ( i.e. , that an instrument should, as a first rule, be read in accordance with the plain meaning that its words import [108] ) cannot but lead us to the conclusion that the Risos-Vidal\u2019s \u201cthird Whereas Clause\u201d objection should be thrown out for lack of merit.\n\nB.3(b)(ii) The Vox Populi Line of Cases .\n\nThe second approach is to accept that such doubt cannot be resolved within the four corners of the written pardon and resort should be taken to the external surrounding circumstances that followed the grant and the interests involved ( i.e. , protection of the interests of the electorate and the recognition of vox populi ), as already discussed above and supplemented by the rulings below.\n\nIn the Fernandez v. House of Representatives Electoral Tribunal [109] line of cases involving the issue of ineligibility based on the residency requirements, that Court declared that it must exercise utmost caution before disqualifying a winning candidate, shown to be the clear choice of the constituents to represent them in Congress .\n\nCiting Frivaldo v. COMELEC , [110] the Court held that time and again it has liberally and equitably construed the electoral laws of our country to give fullest effect to the manifest will of our people, for in case of doubt , political laws must be interpreted to give life and spirit to the popular mandate freely expressed through the ballot . Otherwise stated, legal niceties and technicalities cannot stand in the way of the sovereign will.\n\nFurthermore, to successfully challenge a winning candidate's qualifications , the petitioner must clearly demonstrate that the ineligibility is so patently antagonistic to constitutional and legal principles that overriding such ineligibility and thereby giving effect to the apparent will of the people, would ultimately create greater prejudice to the very democratic institutions and juristic traditions that our Constitution and laws so zealously protect and promote .\n\nAnother significant ruling to consider is Malabaguio v. COMELEC et al . [111] involving the appreciation of ballots, the Court, citing its ruling in Alberto v. COMELEC , [112] declared that election cases involve public interest; thus, laws governing election contests must be liberally construed to the end that the will of the people in the choice of public officials may not be defeated by mere technical objections .\n\nThe Court further reiterated in Maruhom v. COMELEC, et al. [113] its ruling that the question really boils down to a choice of philosophy and perception of how to interpret and apply the laws relating to elections; literal or liberal; the letter or the spirit; the naked provision or the ultimate purpose; legal syllogism or substantial justice; in isolation or in context of social conditions; harshly against or gently in favor of the voter\u2019s obvious choice. In applying election laws, it would be far better to err in favor of popular sovereignty than to be right in complex but little understood legalisms.\n\nIn Rulloda v. COMELEC, et al . [114] involving substitution of candidates, the Court ruled that the purpose of election laws is to give effect to, rather than frustrate, the will of the voters. It is a solemn duty to uphold the clear and unmistakable mandate of the people. It is well-settled that in case of doubt, political laws must be so construed as to give life and spirit to the popular mandate freely expressed through the ballot.\n\nTechnicalities and procedural niceties in election cases should not be made to stand in the way of the true will of the electorate. Laws governing election contests must be liberally construed to the end that the will of the people in the choice of public officials may not be defeated by mere technical objections. [115]\n\nElection contests involve public interest, and technicalities and procedural barriers must yield if they constitute an obstacle to the determination of the true will of the electorate in the choice of their elective officials. The Court frowns upon any interpretation of the law that would hinder in any way not only the free and intelligent casting of the votes in an election but also the correct ascertainment of the results. [116]\n\nThese rulings, applicable in a situation of doubt yields the conclusion that the doubt, if any, in the present case should be resolved in Erap\u2019s favor.\n\nB.4. Conclusions on Pardon and Grave Abuse of Discretion .\n\nIn the light of all the above arguments on pardon and the refutation of the positions of the petitioner Risos-Vidal, I submit to the Court that under the Rule 65 standard of review discussed above, no compelling reason exists to conclude that the COMELEC committed grave abuse of discretion in ruling on the pardon aspect of the case.\n\nNo grave abuse of discretion could have been committed as the COMELEC was correct in its substantive considerations and conclusions. As outlined above, Erap indeed earned the right to vote and to be voted for from the pardon that PGMA granted him. It is the only reasonable and logical conclusion that can be reached under the circumstances of the case.\n\nC.\n\nThe Objections Relating to the 2010 COMELEC\nRulings in the Disqualification Trilogy .\n\nAs I previously discussed, despite the ponencia \u2019s resolution that the COMELEC did not gravely abuse its discretion in ruling on the issue of Erap\u2019s pardon, another crucial issue to be resolved is whether or not the COMELEC gravely abused its discretion in relying on its 2010 rulings in dismissing the Risos-Vidal petition.\n\nThis issue must be resolved in the present case as the assailed COMELEC rulings did not rule specifically on the issue of Erap\u2019s pardon but resolved instead that the issue of Erap\u2019s pardon is already a previously \u201csettled matter,\u201d referring to the consolidated COMELEC Rulings in SPA No. 09-028 (DC) and SPA No. 09-104 (DC), entitled Atty. Evilio C. Pormento v. Joseph Ejercito Estrada and In Re: Petition to Disqualify Estrada Ejercito, Joseph M. From Running As President Due to Constitutional Disqualification and Creating Confusion to the Prejudice of Estrada, Mary Lou B .\n\nAs I will discuss below, the COMELEC did not gravely abuse its discretion in relying on its 2010 disqualification rulings in dismissing Risos-Vidal\u2019s petition.\n\nC.1. The Trilogy of Disqualification Cases in 2010 .\n\nAs narrated above, [117] Erap\u2019s 2010 presidential candidacy gave rise to three cases \u2013 the Pamatong, Pormento and Mary Lou Estrada cases - all aimed at disqualifying him. The COMELEC duly ruled in all these cases. If the effects of these rulings have been muddled at all in the understanding of some, the confusion might have been due to the failure to look at the whole 2010 disqualification scene and to see how these trilogy of disqualification cases interacted with one another.\n\nThe three cases, appropriately given their respective docket numbers, were heard at the same time. While they were essentially based on the same grounds (hence, the description trilogy or a series of three cases that are closely related under a single theme \u2013 the disqualification of Erap ), only the Pormento and Mary Lou Estrada cases were formally consolidated; the Pamatong case, the first of the cases, was not included because Pamatong also sought the disqualification from public office of PGMA on the ground that she is also constitutionally barred from being re-elected.\n\nPetitioner Pamatong expressly put in issue Erap\u2019s fitness to be a candidate based on his previous conviction for plunder and the terms of the pardon extended him by PGMA; the COMELEC, for its part, directly ruled on the matter. To quote the relevant portions of the COMELEC Resolution in Pamatong : [118]\nOn December 28, 2009, Petitioner Pamatong submitted his Position Paper on Joseph E. Estrada and Gloria M. Arroyo, asking the questions: Are they above the law? The Petitioner Pamatong took the absolutist point of view that former President Joseph Ejercito Estrada is banned forever from seeking the same position of President of the Republic having been previously elected as such President. He also espoused the idea that Respondent Gloria Macapagal Arroyo as the sitting President is forever banned from seeking any other elective office, including a post such as member of the House of Representatives.\n\nx x x x\n\nFurthermore, Petitioner maintains that the pardon granted Estrada was conditioned on his promise not to run for any public office again. It was not a full pardon but was a conditional one. The exercise of executive clemency was premised on the condition that former President Estrada should not run again for Office of the President of the Philippines or for any other public office. [119]\n\nx x x x\n\nFurthermore, there is absolutely no indication that the executive clemency exercised by President Gloria Arroyo to pardon Former President Estrada was a mere conditional pardon. It clearly stated that the Former President is \u201crestored to his civil and political rights\u201d and there is nothing in the same which limits the restoration. The only thing stated therein that may have some bearing on the supposed condition is that statement in the whereas clause that contained the following: Whereas, Joseph Estrada has publicly committed to no longer seek any elective position or office, but that is not a condition but is merely part of the preliminary statement. It cannot therefore serve to restrict the operation of or prevail over the explicit statement in the executive clemency which restored all of Estrada\u2019s civil and political rights, including the \u201cright to vote and to be voted for public office\u201d for the position of the Presidency.\n\nThis executive clemency granted to the former President being absolute and unconditional and having been accepted by him, the same can no longer be revoked. [120] [Emphasis supplied]\nHow the three cases exactly related to one another in terms of the issues posed is described by the COMELEC in its consolidated Resolution in the cases of Pormento and Mary Lou Estrada , as follows: [121]\nHowever, as to the substantive aspect of the case , the Respondent\u2019s Answer basically raises and repleads the same defenses which were relied upon in SPA 09-024, except for the additional ground that \u201cthe grant of executive clemency removed all legal impediments that may bar his candidacy for the Presidency.\u201d [122] These grounds consisted of:\n\n[TABLE_CONTENT]\n(a) | The \u201cPresident\u201d being alluded to under section 4 of Article VII of the 1987 Constitution refers to the incumbent President;\n(b) | The Prohibition does not apply to the person who merely serves a tenure and not a complete term;\n(c) | Joseph Estrada is not running for reelection but is \u201crunning again\u201d for the same position of President of the Philippines;\n(d) | The Provisions of section 4 (1st par), Article VII of the 1987 Constitution is clear, unequivocal and unambiguous; hence not subject to any interpretation;\n(e) | The evil sought to be prevented is directed against the incumbent President;\n(f) | The sovereignty of the people should be paramount; and\n(g) | The grant of executive clemency removed all legal impediments that may bar his candidacy for the presidency.[Emphasis supplied]\n[END_TABLE]\n\n(a) The \u201cPresident\u201d being alluded to under section 4 of Article VII of the 1987 Constitution refers to the incumbent President; (b) The Prohibition does not apply to the person who merely serves a tenure and not a complete term; (c) Joseph Estrada is not running for reelection but is \u201crunning again\u201d for the same position of President of the Philippines; (d) The Provisions of section 4 (1st par), Article VII of the 1987 Constitution is clear, unequivocal and unambiguous; hence not subject to any interpretation; (e) The evil sought to be prevented is directed against the incumbent President; (f) The sovereignty of the people should be paramount; and (g) The grant of executive clemency removed all legal impediments that may bar his candidacy for the presidency. [Emphasis supplied] As arranged during the COMELEC\u2019s common hearing on the trilogy, separate decisions were rendered simultaneously. [123] They all touched on the issue of pardon.\n\nAs likewise already explained above, all three cases became final, executory and unappealable five (5) days after its promulgation, pursuant to Section 3, Rule 37 of the COMELEC Rules of Procedure. [124] Since all the petitioners filed their respective motions for reconsideration, finality was reckoned from the denial of these motions.\n\nOf the three, petitioner Pormento went one step further to assail the final COMELEC ruling before this Court. His effort did not bear fruitful result as the Court dismissed his petition for mootness \u2013 when the Court issued its ruling, Erap had lost the 2013 presidential elections.\n\nIn the dismissal of the Pormento petition before this Court [G.R. No. 191188], a nagging issue that has left some uncertainty is the effect of the dismissal on the COMELEC\u2019s Pormento ruling. This assailed COMELEC resolution tackled two issues: 1) the constitutional prohibition on re-election; and 2) the nature of Erap\u2019s pardon and its effect on his qualification to run for an elective public office or as President.\n\nThe Court, however, in dismissing the case, focused its discussions solely on the issue of the constitutional ban on re-election and ruled that this issue had been rendered moot by the supervening event of Erap\u2019s loss in the 2010 elections; the Court did not discuss or even mention the issue of whether the COMELEC gravely abused its discretion in ruling that Erap\u2019s pardon was absolute and had restored his right to run for the Presidency.\n\nIn this situation, the assailed COMELEC ruling simply becomes, not only final and executory, but unassailable. No appeal is available as an appeal is barred by the Constitution. [125] No petition for certiorari is likewise available unless another petition had been filed within the period for filing allowed by the Rules of Court. [126] Thus, the COMELEC rulings on the trilogy of disqualification cases fully stand, enforceable according to their terms. From the perspective of the Court, no enforceable ruling was made nor any principle of law established. In other words, the final ruling to be reckoned with in any future dispute is effectively the COMELEC ruling.\n\nC.2. The Risos-Vidal Petition and its Objections against Erap\u2019s Status .\n\nC.2(a) The Objections and its Fallacies .\n\nThe Risos-Vidal petition, fully supported by J. Leonen, objects to the binding effect of the 2010 disqualification trilogy decisions, on the claim that res judicata did not apply because pardon was not an issue ruled upon in 2010.\n\nThis may have partly stemmed from the statement of issues in the 2010 COMELEC Resolution in Pormento defining the issues common to Pormento and Mary Lou Estrada , disregarding the incidents that transpired in the trilogy and the issues that Erap raised in his Answer. [127] Another source of confusion perhaps was the fact that the COMELEC, in ruling on the 2013 Risos-Vidal petition, only cited the Pormento and Mary Lou Estrada cases .\n\nThe objections, in my view, do not take into account the sequence of events in 2010 on the filing of the disqualification cases, the relationship of the disqualification cases with one another, the law on the finality and binding effect of rulings , and the reason for the COMELEC\u2019s citation of the Pormento and Mary Lou Estrada rulings in the subsequent 2013 Risos-Vidal petition.\n\nIn Pamatong, Pamatong raised this issue in his Position Paper. Thus, pardon was an issue raised and ruled upon. The same process took place in the subsequent consolidated cases of Pormento and Mary Lou Estrada , so that the COMELEC itself, in its resolution of these cases, recognized that pardon was one of the issues that Erap raised and accordingly ruled on the matter. Significantly, the COMELEC rulings on the matter of pardon in all three cases practically carried the same wording , revealing the COMELEC\u2019s view that the cases constituted a trilogy that posed practically the same issues, one of which is the pardon of Erap.\n\nC.2(b) Res Judicata and its Application to the Case .\n\nThe COMELEC Second Division, in dismissing the Risos-Vidal disqualification petition against Erap, emphasized that the issue of whether Erap\u2019s pardon allowed him to run for office had already been fully discussed in previous cases, and no longer needed re-examination. The COMELEC additionally pointed out that petitioner Risos-Vidal failed to provide sufficient reason to reverse its prior decision.\n\nJ. Leonen noted that this Court is not barred by res judicata from revisiting the issue of Erap\u2019s pardon; we can review the COMELEC\u2019s decision because there is neither identity of the parties, of subject matters, and of causes of action in the previous disqualification cases. J. Leonen also pointed out that the Court had not ruled with finality on the issue of Erap\u2019s pardon in Pormento , because supervening events had rendered the case moot.\n\nI disagree with J. Leonen. As I earlier pointed out, we must review the COMELEC\u2019s decision using the standard of grave abuse of discretion : we nullify the COMELEC ruling if it gravely abused its discretion in ruling on the present case; if no grave abuse of discretion existed, the Risos-Vidal petition should be dismissed instead of being granted.\n\nAs I will proceed to discuss below, the COMELEC did not gravely abuse its discretion when it ruled in the present case that Erap\u2019s pardon qualified him to run for an elective public office and that this issue is a previously \u201csettled matter.\u201d [128] I say this because the principle of res judicata , under either of its two modes - conclusiveness of judgment or bar by prior judgment- applies in the present case .\n\nRes judicata embraces two concepts: first , the bar by prior judgment under Rule 39, Section 47 (b) of the Rules of Court; and second , the preclusion of a settled issue or conclusiveness of judgment under Rule 39, Section 47 (c) of the Rules of Court. The COMELEC\u2019s 2010 decision resolving whether Erap\u2019s pardon allowed him to run for elections precludes further discussion of the very same issue in the 2013 petition filed against his candidacy.\n\nUnder our review in the present case that is limited to the determination of grave abuse of discretion and not legal error, I cannot agree with J. Leonen\u2019s strict application of the requisites of bar by prior judgment. Jurisprudence has clarified that res judicata does not require absolute identity, but merely substantial identity. This consideration, under a grave abuse standard of review, leads me to the conclusion that we cannot reverse the COMELEC\u2019s decision to apply res judicata , even if it meant the application of the concept of bar by prior judgment.\n\nC.2(b)(i) Issue preclusion or res judicata by conclusiveness of judgment .\n\nIssue preclusion ( or conclusiveness of judgment ) prevents the same parties and their privies from re-opening an issue that has already been decided in a prior case. In other words, once a right, fact, or matter in issue has been directly adjudicated or necessarily involved in the determination of an action, it is conclusively settled and cannot again be litigated between the parties and their privies, regardless of whether or not the claim, demand, or subject matter of the two actions are the same.\n\nFor conclusiveness of judgment to apply, the second case should have identical parties as the first case, which must have been settled by final judgment . It does not, unlike the bar by previous judgment , need identity of subject matter and causes of action.\n\nNote at this point, that Rule 37, Section 3 of the COMELEC Rules of Procedure renders the COMELEC\u2019s decision final and executory within five days after its promulgation, unless otherwise restrained by the Court. Neither of the two COMELEC decisions involving Erap\u2019s disqualification in 2010 had been restrained by the Court; suffice it to say that the five-day period after promulgation of the decisions in these cases had long passed.\n\nThus, the COMELEC did not err in considering its decisions in these cases \u2013 all of which resolved the character of Erap\u2019s pardon on the merits \u2013 to be final and executory . That the Court refused to give due course to Pormento \u2019s petition assailing the COMELEC decision on the ground that its issues had been rendered moot by the 2010 elections, did not make the COMELEC\u2019s decision any less final. In fact, Pormento was already final when it reached the Court, subject to the Court\u2019s authority to order its nullification if grave abuse of discretion had intervened.\n\nOn the requirement of identity of parties , Erap was the defendant in all four cases. While the petitioners in these cases were not the same persons, all of them represented the same interest as citizens of voting age filing their petitions to ensure that Erap, an election candidate, is declared not qualified to run and hold office. Notably, Rule 25, Section 2 of the COMELEC Rules of Procedure [129] requires a prospective petitioner to be a citizen of voting age, or a duly registered political party, to file a petition for disqualification, regardless of the position the candidate sought to be disqualified aspires for.\n\nWe have had, in several instances, applied res judicata to subsequent cases whose parties were not absolutely identical , but substantially identical in terms of the interests they represent. [130] The cases filed against Erap\u2019s candidacy in the 2010 elections and in the 2013 elections share substantially the common interest of disqualifying Erap as a candidate; these petitioners also all contended that Erap was not qualified to be a candidate because of his previous conviction of plunder.\n\nThat the 2010 cases involved Erap\u2019s bid for re-election for presidency and the 2013 cases revolved around his mayoralty bid is not, in my view, relevant for purposes of applying collateral estoppel because the identity of the causes of action or the subject matters are not necessary to preclude an issue already litigated and decided on the merits in a prior case. What is crucial for collateral estoppel to apply to the second case is the identity of the issues between the two cases , which had already been decided on the merits in the first case. All the cases seeking to disqualify Erap from running hinged on his previous conviction and on arguments characterizing his subsequent pardon to be merely conditional.\n\nThe COMELEC had already decided this issue, not once, but twice when it separately but simultaneously decided Pamatong\u2019s petition and the consolidated petitions of Pormento and Estrada. In these cases, it gave the petitioners Pamatong, Pormento and Estrada ample opportunity to present their arguments regarding the nature of Erap\u2019s pardon, to which Erap had also been allowed to reply. After considering their arguments, the COMELEC issued its resolutions that the absolute nature of Erap\u2019s pardon restored both his right to vote and be voted for.\n\nC.2(b)(ii) Res judicata through bar by prior judgment .\n\nRes judicata, by way of bar by prior judgment , binds the parties to a case, as well as their privies to its judgment, and prevents them from re-litigating the same cause of action in another case. Otherwise put, the judgment or decree of the court of competent jurisdiction on the merits concludes the litigation between the parties, as well as their privies, and constitutes a bar to a new action or suit involving the same cause of action before the same or other tribunal.\n\nRes judicata through bar by prior judgment requires (a) that the former judgment be final; (b) that the judgment was rendered by a court of competent jurisdiction; (c) that it is a judgment on the merits; and (d) that, between the first and the second actions, there is identity of parties, subject matters, and causes of action.\n\nThese requisites were complied with in the present case.\n\nC.2(b)(ii)(a) COMELEC as Tribunal of Competent Jurisdiction .\n\nThat the COMELEC is a tribunal of competent jurisdiction in cancellation of CoC and candidate disqualification cases is mandated by the Constitution no less. Section 2(2), Article IX(C) of the Constitution provides that:\nSection 2. The Commission on Elections shall exercise the following powers and functions:\n\nx x x x\n\n2. Exercise exclusive original jurisdiction over all contests relating to the elections, returns, and qualifications of all elective regional, provincial, and city officials , and appellate jurisdiction over all contests involving elective municipal officials decided by trial courts of general jurisdiction, or involving elective barangay officials decided by trial courts of limited jurisdiction . [Emphasis and underscoring supplied]\nThus, the competence of the COMELEC to rule on these cases at the first instance needs no further elaboration.\n\nC.2(b)(ii)(b) Finality of the 2010 Disqualification Rulings .\n\nSome aspects of finality of the disqualification trilogy rulings have been discussed above [131] in terms of when COMELEC judgments become final and the recourses available to assail these judgments. But separately from these questions is the question of the effects of the finality of judgments .\n\nOnce a judgment attains finality, it becomes immutable and unalterable. It may not be changed, altered or modified in any way even if the modification is for the purpose of correcting an erroneous conclusion of fact or law. This is the \u201c doctrine of finality of judgments \u201d which binds the immediate parties and their privies in personal judgments; the whole world in judgments in rem; and even the highest court of the land as to their binding effect. [132]\n\nThis doctrine is grounded on fundamental considerations of public policy and sound practice and that, at the risk of occasional errors, the judgments or orders of courts must become final at some definite time fixed by law; otherwise, there would be no end to litigations, thus setting to naught the main role of courts, which is, to assist in the enforcement of the rule of law and the maintenance of peace and order by settling justiciable controversies with finality. [133]\n\nA final judgment vests in the prevailing party a right recognized and protected by law under the due process clause of the Constitution. A final judgment is a vested interest and it is only proper and equitable that the government should recognize and protect this right. Furthermore, an individual cannot be deprived of this right arbitrarily without causing injustice. [134]\n\nJust as the losing party has the right to file an appeal within the prescribed period, the winning party also has the correlative right to enjoy the finality of the resolution of his case. [135]\n\nIn the present case, the COMELEC\u2019s final rulings in the Pamatong, Pormento and Mary Lou Estrada petitions had been made executory through the inclusion of Erap as a candidate not only as a President in the 2010 elections but as Mayor in the 2013 elections.\n\nThus, the COMELEC\u2019s 2010 final ruling in Pamatong and Pormento had been made executory twice not only with respect to the interest of Erap, the winning party, through the inclusion of his name as a candidate, but more importantly, the public, by allowing the electorate to vote for him as a presidential candidate in 2010 and as a mayoralty candidate in 2013.\n\nThe difference of this case from the usual disqualification cases is that the 2010 unalterable COMELEC ruling on the Erap pardon involved the issue of his political status binding on the whole world and has made his candidacy in the 2013 elections and other future elections valid and immune from another petition for disqualification based on his conviction for plunder. This topic will be discussed at length below.\n\nC.2(b)(ii)(c) Judgment on the Merits .\n\nA judgment is on the merits when it determines the rights and liabilities of the parties based on the disclosed facts, irrespective of formal, technical or dilatory objections. [136]\n\nIn Pamatong\u2019s petition to cancel and deny due course to Estrada\u2019s CoC [137] for the position of President in the 2010 elections, the issue of pardon was clearly raised and argued by the parties, resulting in the COMELEC resolution quoted above, specifically ruling that the Erap pardon was absolute and not conditional, entitling him the right to vote and to be voted upon. Not being conditional simply meant that it was not based on Erap\u2019s promise not to run for any public office . [138]\n\nIn Pormento (which was consolidated with Mary Lou Estrada ), the petitioner likewise sought to prevent Estrada from running as President in the 2010 elections. Estrada re-pleaded in his answer the defenses that he raised in Pamatong and added the argument that the grant of executive clemency in his favor removed all legal impediments that may bar his candidacy for the presidency . [139]\n\nThat pardon was not an issue specified by the COMELEC when it defined the issues common to petitioners Pormento and Mary Lou Estrada is of no moment since COMELEC only outlined the issues that petitioners Pormento and Mary Lou Estrada commonly shared. The matter of pardon was raised as a defense by Estrada and this was duly noted by the COMELEC in its resolution. [140] Under these circumstances, what assumes importance are the terms of the COMELEC resolution itself which expressly discussed and ruled that the Erap pardon was absolute and had the effect of restoring his right to vote and be voted upon.\n\nIn fact, even if petitioners Pormento and Mary Lou Estrada did not fully argue the pardon issue that Erap raised, it must be appreciated that this issue was indisputably fully argued, ruled upon and became final in Pamatong which was one of the 2010 trilogy of disqualification cases. This finality could not but have an effect on the Pormento and Mary Lou Estrada rulings which carried the same rulings on pardon as Pamatong . The Pormento and Mary Lou Estrada rulings on pardon, which themselves lapsed to finality can, at the very least, be read as a recognition of the final judgment on the pardon in issue in Pamatong , as well as the official final stand of COMELEC on the issue of the Erap pardon.\n\nThese antecedent proceedings, the parties\u2019 arguments in their respective pleadings, and the COMELEC rulings in Pamatong [SPA 09-24 (DC)] and in Pormento [SPA 09-28] clearly show that the COMELEC rulings in these cases on the issue of pardon were decisions on the merits that can be cited as authorities in future cases.\n\nC.2(b)(ii)(d) Identity of Parties, Subject Matter and Cause of Action .\n\nIdentity of parties\n\nTwo kinds of judgments exist with respect to the parties to the case. The first are the parties in proceedings in personam where the judgments are enforceable only between the parties and their successors in interests, but not against strangers thereto. The second type are the judgments in proceedings where the object of the suit is to bar indifferently all who might be minded to make an objection of any sort against the right sought to be established, and anyone in the world who has a right to be heard on the strength of alleged facts which, if true, show an inconsistent interest; the proceeding is in rem and the judgment is a judgment in rem . [141]\n\nThis rule is embodied under Section 47, Rule 39 which provides the effect of a judgment or final order rendered by a court of the Philippines, having jurisdiction to pronounce the judgment or final order. In paragraph 47(a), the rules provide that in case of a judgment or final order xxx in respect to the personal, political , or legal condition or status of a particular person or his relationship to another, the judgment or final order is conclusive upon the title to the thing, the will or administration or the condition, status or relationship of the person x x x. [142]\n\nIn the present case, the 2010 COMELEC final rulings that Erap was qualified to run for public office, after consideration of the issues of presidential re-election and the effect of his pardon for the crime of plunder, constituted a judgment in rem as it was a judgment or final order on the political status of Erap to run for and to hold public office.\n\nIn other words, a declaration of the disqualification or qualification of a candidate binds the whole world as the final ruling of the COMELEC regarding Erap\u2019s perpetual absolute disqualification and pardon had already become conclusive. The 2010 final rulings of the COMELEC thus bar Risos-Vidal in 2013 from raising the same issue in view of the nature of the 2010 rulings as judgments in rem .\n\nI also reiterate my previous discussion that in determining whether res judicata exists, the Court had previously ruled that absolute identity of parties is not required but substantial identity, such that the parties in the first and second cases share the same or a community of interest. As discussed above, this requisite is present in the 2010 disqualification cases and the present Risos-Vidal case.\n\nIdentity of causes of action and subject matters\n\nI discuss first the element of identity of causes of action because, in the process, the element of identity of subject matters would be likewise covered. On the element of identity of causes of action between the first and second cases, J. Leonen asserts that the 2010 disqualification cases filed by Pormento and Mary Lou Estrada were based on causes of action that were different from those in the present case.\n\nAccording to J. Leonen, the 2010 cases were anchored on the constitutional prohibition against a president\u2019s re-election and the additional ground that Erap was a nuisance candidate. The present case is anchored on Erap\u2019s conviction for plunder which carried with it the accessory penalty of perpetual absolute disqualification. The present case is additionally based on Section 40 of the LGC as well as Section 12 of the OEC. This is clear from the COMELEC\u2019s recital of issues. [143]\n\nI disagree with J. Leonen\u2019s positions and short-sighted view of the issues and I maintain that there are identical subject matters and causes of actions, especially for purposes of complying with the requirements of res judicata by way of bar by prior judgment.\n\nAt this juncture, I reiterate my disagreement with J. Leonen in strictly applying the requisites for the application of res judicata through bar by prior judgment. The Court itself, in numerous cases, did not strictly apply the requirement that there must be absolute identity of causes of action. In fact, the Court\u2019s rulings on this particular element leaned towards substantial identity of causes of action and its determination is arrived at not on the basis of the facial value of the cases but after an in-depth analysis of each case.\n\nThe reason why substantial identity of causes of action is permitted is to preclude a situation where a party could easily escape the operation of res judicata by changing the form of the action or the relief sought. The difference in form and nature of the two actions is also immaterial and is not a reason to exempt these cases from the effects of res judicata .\n\nThe philosophy behind this rule prohibits the parties from litigating the same issue more than once. When a right or fact has been judicially tried and determined by a court of competent jurisdiction or an opportunity for such trial has been given , the judgment of the court, as long as it remains unreversed, should be conclusive upon the parties and those in privity with them. In this way, there should be an end to litigation by the same parties and their privies over a subject, once the issue involving the subject is fully and fairly adjudicated. [144]\n\nIn light of the jurisprudence on res judicata by way of bar by prior judgment, it is my view that the COMELEC did not gravely abuse its discretion in ruling that the issue of Erap\u2019s pardon and its effects on his right to run for elective public office had already been settled in the 2010 disqualification cases.\n\nIn our jurisdiction, the Court uses various tests in determining whether or not there is identity of causes of action in the first and second cases. One of these tests is the \u201c absence of inconsistency test \u201d where it is determined whether or not the judgment sought will be inconsistent with the prior judgment. If inconsistency is not shown, the prior judgment shall not constitute a bar to subsequent actions. [145]\n\nThe second and more common approach in ascertaining identity of causes of action is the \u201c same evidence test ,\u201d where the criterion is determined by the question: \u201c would the same evidence support and establish both the present and former causes of action? \u201d If the answer is in the affirmative, then the prior judgment is a bar to the subsequent action; conversely, it is not. [146]\n\nApplying these tests, it is readily apparent that there were identical causes of action in the 2010 disqualification cases against Erap and the present Risos-Vidal case.\n\nUsing the absence of inconsistency test , the 2010 final COMELEC rulings that Erap was qualified to run for Presidency, an elective public office, would be inconsistent with the ruling being sought in the present case which is, essentially, that Erap\u2019s pardon did not remove his perpetual absolute disqualification to run for elective public office, this time as Mayor of the City of Manila.\n\nIn short, Erap\u2019s pardon and its effects on his perpetual absolute disqualification brought about by his conviction affect his qualification to run for all elective public offices . Thus the 2010 rulings cannot be limited or linked only to the issue of his qualification to run as President of the Philippines but to any elective public position that he may aspire for in the future.\n\nApplying the \u201c same evidence test, \u201d suffice it to say that the Risos-Vidal\u2019s petition rests and falls on Erap\u2019s pardon and its effects on his qualification to run for elective public office. Erap\u2019s pardon is the same evidence necessary for the COMELEC to resolve in the 2010 disqualification cases the issue of whether or not Erap\u2019s pardon removed his disqualification to run for elective public office, thus qualifying him to run for Presidency.\n\nIt must be recalled that Risos-Vidal relies on Section 40 [147] of the LGC and Section 12 [148] of the OEC, specifically relating to the disqualification ground of a person\u2019s conviction for a crime involving moral turpitude, in this case, plunder. However, if we are to look closely at these provisions, [149] Erap would not have been disqualified under these provisions because he had already served the 2-year prohibitive period under Section 40 of the LGC. [150] The real main issue of the Risos-Vidal petition is the perpetual absolute disqualification imposed on Erap as an accessory penalty for his conviction for a crime involving moral turpitude; and that his pardon did not remit this disqualification. This issue was obviously directly ruled upon by the COMELEC in the 2010 disqualification cases. Hence, applying the same evidence test , there is identity of causes of action between the 2010 and the Risos-Vidal cases. There was likewise identity of subject matters, specifically the qualification of Erap to run for public office in relation to his pardon.\n\nAs a side note, I observe that in the 2010 cases, had the COMELEC ruled that Erap had been disqualified to run for elective public office despite his pardon, the issue of the constitutional ban against his re-election would have become moot and academic as Erap would never be qualified in the first place to run for an elective office. Therefore, the ground for Erap\u2019s disqualification based on his perpetual absolute disqualification in relation to his pardon, which were raised by the parties in 2010, were material and necessary for the resolution of the re-election issue. Otherwise, to simply disregard the pardon issue and proceed immediately to the issue on the constitutional ban on re-election is not only absurd but would have been the height of legal ignorance. Fortunately, the COMELEC correctly ruled on the pardon issue directly and did not gravely abuse its discretion in doing so.\n\nSince the COMELEC had already decided the issue of Erap\u2019s pardon in the past, it did not act with grave abuse of discretion when it chose not to reverse its prior rulings. Its past decisions, which became final and executory, addressed this issue on the merits. This, and the substantial causes of action, subject matters, and substantial identity of the parties in the 2010 and 2013 cases, sufficiently justified the COMELEC from keeping the discussion of the issue of Erap\u2019s pardon in the 2013 disqualification case.\n\n3. Grave Abuse of Discretion, the 2010 Disqualification Trilogy, and COMELEC\u2019s Risos-Vidal Ruling .\n\nIn light of the above discussions, the COMELEC did not gravely abuse its discretion in its Resolution of April 1, 2013 dismissing the Risos-Vidal petition for lack of merit. In fact, the COMELEC would have gravely abused its discretion had it granted the petition in light of the 2010 trilogy of disqualification cases and the finality of its previous final rulings that the third Whereas Clause of Erap\u2019s pardon did not affect at all the restoration of his civil and political rights, including his right to vote and to be voted upon.\n\nWhatever might be said of the trilogy of cases, the reality is that the issue of pardon was brought to the forefront of the argued issues when the parties raised it in all the disqualification cases against Erap and the COMELEC ruled on the issue. That the pardon issue was overshadowed by the presidential re-election issue, not only in the COMELEC, but all the way to this Court, may be an adjudicatory defect, but certainly is not imperfection on the part of Erap for which he should suffer.\n\nTo be sure, the COMELEC resolution is not a model resolution that is free from imperfections; it cannot serve as a model for legal drafting or for legal reasoning. But whatever these imperfections might be, they could not \u2013 as above explained - have gone beyond errors of law, into grave abuse of discretion. Having been rulings twice-implemented in 2010 and 2013 elections, these past rulings cannot and should not now be repudiated without committing fraud against the electorate who cast their vote and showed their preference for Erap without any notice that their votes ran the risk of being declared stray.\n\nFor all the above reasons, I vote to dismiss the Risos-Vidal petition for lack of merit.\n\n[1] Section 2, Republic Act No. 7080.\n\n[2] Resolution of the COMELEC dated January 20, 2010 was attached as Annex 4 to Annex H of the Petitioner\u2019s Memorandum.\n\n[3] See page 8 of the COMELEC, Second Division Resolution dated January 20, 2010 in SPA No. 09-024(DC) entitled Rev.

Bernas: The decision I cited was precisely an interpretation of the clause in the provisions on the COMELEC which says: \u201cAny decision, order, or ruling of the Commission may be brought to the Supreme Court on certiorari \u2026\u201d In interpreting that provision in the case of Aratuc , the Supreme Court said:\n\nWe hold therefore that under the existing constitutional and statutory provisions, the certiorari jurisdiction of the Court over orders, rulings and decision of the COMELEC is not as broad as it used to be and should be confined to instances of grave abuse of discretion amounting to patent and substantial denial of due process. Does that express the sense of the Committee?\n\nMr. Regalado. That was the view of Justice Barredo in the Aratuc case while he was the ponente xxx In subsequent decisions wherein Chief Justice Teehankee concurred, he believed that the mode of review on certiorari under Rule XLV [should be LXV] is to be understood as including acts of the Constitutional Commissions, without jurisdiction or acting in excess of jurisdiction.\n\nFr. Bernas. This seems to be the same thing. If it is without jurisdiction or in excess of jurisdiction, there is grave abuse of discretion.\n\nMr. Regalado. No, Commissioner. Grave abuse of discretion may be equivalent to lack of jurisdiction, if it was done in a capricious or whimsical manner. But excess of jurisdiction is a little different, meaning, that the Supreme Court had jurisdiction but it overstepped the bounds of jurisdiction in the exercise thereof. That is what Justice Teehankee also pointed out. Grave abuse of discretion, I agree, results in lack of jurisdiction, but excess of jurisdiction presupposes that the Court, while with jurisdiction just overstepped the permissible bounds in the exercise thereof.\n\nFr. Bernas: So, for purposes of the record now, what is the intention of the Committee? What are the grounds for certiorari ?\n\nMr. Regalado. The Committee which refers specifically to technical term of review by certiorari would be relying on the provisions of Rule XLV [Should be LXV] of the Rules of Court that laid down the three grounds.

The Declaration arose directly from the experience of the Second World War and represents the first global expression of rights to which all human beings are inherently entitled. The Declaration consists of thirty articles which have been elaborated in subsequent international treaties, regional human rights instruments, national constitutions, and other laws. The International Bill of Human Rights consists of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and its two Optional Protocols. In 1966, the General Assembly adopted the two detailed Covenants, which complete the International Bill of Human Rights. In 1976, after the Covenants had been ratified by a sufficient number of individual nations, the Bill took on the force of international law.\n\nThe Declaration was commissioned in 1946 and was drafted over two years by the Commission on Human Rights. The Philippine representative was part of the Commission; the Philippines voted in favor of this Declaration.

The matter, however, is engrossed in a deeper constitutional conundrum that affects the exercise of one of the most benevolent powers of the President\u2014the power to extend executive clemency in the form of pardon. Undoubtedly, the Court\u2019s ruling on this case would shape the parameters surrounding the future exercise of the said power, thus, requiring a pragmatic stance that would equal the theoretical and practical purpose of the pardoning power, that is, the realization of checks and balances in government and the relief given to the pardonee.\n\nThe undisputed facts as culled from the records:\n\nIn its September 12, 2007 Decision, the Sandiganbayan convicted respondent former President Joseph Ejercito Estrada ( Estrada ) of plunder. The fallo of the decision reads:\nWHEREFORE, in view of all the foregoing, judgment is hereby rendered in Criminal Case No. 26558 finding the accused, Former President Joseph Ejercito Estrada, GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of PLUNDER, defined in and penalized by Republic Act No. 7080, as amended. On the other hand, for failure of the prosecution to prove and establish their guilt beyond reasonable doubt, the Court finds the accused Jose \u201cJinggoy\u201d Estrada and Atty. Edward S. Serapio NOT GUILTY of the crime of plunder and, accordingly, the Court hereby orders their ACQUITTAL.\n\nThe penalty imposable for the crime of plunder under Republic Act No. 7080, as amended by Republic Act No. 7659, is Reclusion Perpetua to Death . There being no aggravating or mitigating circumstances, however, the lesser penalty shall be applied in accordance with Article 63 of the Revised Penal Code. Accordingly, the accused Former President Joseph Ejercito Estrada is hereby sentenced to suffer the penalty of Reclusion Perpetua and the accessory penalties of civil interdiction during the period of sentence and perpetual absolute disqualification.\n\nThe period within which accused Former President Joseph Ejercito Estrada has been under detention shall be credited to him in full as long as he agrees voluntarily in writing to abide by the same disciplinary rules imposed upon convicted prisoners.\n\nMoreover, in accordance with Section 2 of Republic Act No. 7080, as amended by Republic Act No. 7659, the Court hereby declares the forfeiture in favor of the government of the following:\n\n(1) The total amount of Five Hundred Forty Two Million Seven Hundred Ninety One Thousand Pesos (P545,291,000.00), with interest and income earned, inclusive of the amount of Two Hundred Million Pesos (P200,000,000.00), deposited in the name and account of the Erap Muslim Youth Foundation.\n\n(2) The amount of One Hundred Eighty Nine Million Pesos (P189,000,000.00), inclusive of interests and income earned, deposited in the Jose Velarde account.\n\n(3) The real property consisting of a house and lot dubbed as Boracay Mansion located at #100 11th Street, New Manila, Quezon City.\n\nThe cash bonds posted by accused Jose Jinggoy Estrada and Atty. Edward S. Serapio are hereby ordered cancelled and released to the said accused or their duly authorized representatives upon presentation of the original receipt evidencing payment thereof and subject to the usual accounting and auditing procedures. Likewise, the hold-departure orders issued against the said accused are hereby recalled and declared functus oficio.\n\nSO ORDERED.\nOn October 25, 2007, then President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo (PGMA) granted executive clemency to Estrada. The text of the said pardon is hereunder replicated:\nMALACANAN PALACE\nMANILA\n_________________________________________________\n\nBy the President of the Philippines\n\nPARDON\n_________________________________________________\n\nWhereas, this Administration has a policy of releasing inmates who have reached the age of seventy (70),\n\nWhereas, Joseph Ejercito Estrada has been under detention for six and a half years,\n\nWhereas, Joseph Ejercito Estrada has publicly committed to no longer seek any elective position or office,\n\nIn view hereof and pursuant to the authority conferred upon me by the Constitution, I hereby grant executive clemency to Joseph Ejercito Estrada, convicted by the Sandiganbayan of plunder and imposed a penalty of reclusion perpetua. He is hereby restored to his civil and political rights.\n\nThe forfeitures imposed by the Sandiganbayan remain in force and in full, including all writs and processes issued by the Sandiganbayan in pursuance hereof, except for the bank account(s) he owned before his tenure as President.\n\nUpon acceptance of this pardon by JOSEPH EJERCITO ESTRADA, this pardon shall take effect.\n\nGiven under my hand at the City of Manila,\nthis 25 th day of October, in\u00a0 the year of\nOur Lord, two thousand and seven.\n\nGloria M. Arroyo (sgd.)\n\nBy the President:\n\nIGNACIO R. BUNYE (sgd.)\nActing Executive Secretary\n\n[Emphasis supplied] The next day, Estrada accepted the pardon as evidenced by a handwritten notation in the same document.\n\nSubsequently, Estrada undertook his second bid for the presidency during the 2010 elections. This candidacy hurdled two (2) disqualification cases filed by Atty. Evilio C. Pormento and Mary Lou B. Estrada ( 2010 disqualification cases ), when these were denied for lack of merit by the Commission on Elections ( COMELEC ), Second Division, and the COMELEC En Banc in its respective resolutions, dated January 20, 2010 [1] and April 27, 2010. [2] The COMELEC was of the position that Estrada was eligible to run for president on the ground that the constitutional prohibition on re-election [3] applies to an incumbent president.\n\nUpon elevation to the Court, however, the opportunity to resolve the said constitutional issue was arrested by mootness, with Estrada having lost the elections to President Benigno Aquino. [4]\n\nUndaunted by his defeat in the race for national office, Estrada thereafter sought the position of mayor in no less than the City of Manila. He filed his certificate of candidacy on October 2, 2012.\n\nPetitioner Atty. Alicia Risos-Vidal ( petitioner ) invoked Estrada\u2019s disqualification from running for public office, this time on the ground that his candidacy was a violation of the pardon extended by PGMA. She filed a petition for disqualification with the COMELEC [5] pursuant to Section 12 of Batas Pambansa Blg. 881 (Omnibus Election Code), [6] grounded on a sole argument, viz :\nRESPONDENT IS DISQUALIFIED TO RUN FOR PUBLIC OFFICE BECUSE OF HIS CONVICTION FOR PLUNDER BY THE SANDIGANBAYAN IN CRIMINAL CASE NO. 26558 ENTITLED \u201cPEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES VS. JOSEPH EJERCITO ESTRADA\u201d SENTENCING HIM TO SUFFER THE PENALTY OF RECLUSION PERPETUA WITH PERPETUAL ABSOLUTE DISQUALIFICATION.\nIn the main, the petitioner argued that Estrada was still suffering from the accessory penalties of civil interdiction and perpetual disqualification because the pardon granted to him failed to expressly restore his right to suffrage and to run for public office as provided under Articles 36 and 41 of the Revised Penal Code. Furthermore, the \u201cwhereas clause\u201d in the pardon which stated that, \u201c Joseph Ejercito Estrada has publicly committed to no longer seek any elective position or office \u201d would indicate a condition that Estrada must abide by under pain of recommitment to prison in the event of violation thereof. The petitioner likewise finds support in the concurring opinion of Justice Padilla in Monsanto v. Factoran , [7] stated in this wise:\nAn examination of the presidential pardon in question shows that, while petitioner was granted \"an absolute and unconditional pardon and restored to full civil and political rights\", yet, nothing therein expressly provides that the right to hold public office was thereby restored to the petitioner. In view of the express exclusion by Art. 36, RPC of the right to hold public office, notwithstanding a pardon unless the right is expressly restored by the pardon, it is my considered opinion that, to the extent that the pardon granted to the petitioner did not expressly restore the right to hold public office as an effect of such pardon, that right must be kept away from the petitioner.\nAfter an exchange of pleadings, the COMELEC Second Division issued its April 1, 2013 Resolution dismissing the petition for lack of merit. [8] The dismissal was grounded on its resolution of the 2010 disqualification cases where it found that the pardon granted to Estrada was absolute and unconditional, hence, entitling him to run for public office. The dismissal was affirmed over petitioner\u2019s motion for reconsideration in the April 23, 2013 Resolution of the COMELEC En Banc. [9]\n\nImpervious to her cause, the petitioner comes to this Court, ascribing grave abuse of discretion on the part of the COMELEC in declining to disqualify Estrada motu propio , based on the following grounds cited by it: 1] the issues raised in the petition have already been passed upon in the past; 2] Estrada\u2019s pardon was not conditional; 3] Estrada is not disqualified to run as mayor despite Section 40 of the Local Government Code ( LGC ); and 4] Estrada\u2019s pardon restored his right to suffrage and remitted his perpetual disqualification from seeking public office.\n\nDuring the pendency of the petition, local elections were conducted on May 13, 2013, yielding a victory for Estrada over his opponents including then incumbent Mayor Alfredo S. Lim ( Lim ). Consequently, the latter moved to intervene in the petition, which was granted by the Court in its June 25, 2013 Resolution. [10] Lim supports petitioner\u2019s theory that Estrada remains to be disqualified to hold public office as his pardon did not expressly remit his perpetual disqualification, and, pursuant to the Court\u2019s ruling in Jalosjos v. COMELEC , [11] he must be declared as the rightful mayor of the City of Manila.\n\nAfter an exchange of pleadings, [12] the parties were required to submit their respective memoranda. The parties complied on different dates. [13]\n\nTo my mind, the following queries and premises, which are crafted in a clear-cut and logical sequence, serve as guideposts for the Court in order to arrive at conclusions that are consonant with prevailing law and jurisprudence:\nWas the executive pardon extended to Estrada conditional or absolute?\n\nWhat were the effects of the pardon, particularly the statement, \u201c[h]e is hereby restored to his civil and political rights\u201d? Does this include the restoration of his right to suffrage and to run for public office?\n\nGiven that the nature of pardon, whether absolute or conditional, does not imply the automatic obliteration of the pardonee\u2019s guilt, is Estrada qualified to run for and hold a mayoralty position?\nI.\u00a0 Estrada\u2019s Pardon Was Absolute\n\nAfter admittedly having failed to argue on this before the COMELEC, the petitioner expressly elevated this issue for the resolution of the Court. Her insistence on the conditional nature of Estrada\u2019s pardon is anchored on the latter\u2019s expressed acceptance of the same. In her words, this acceptance became \u201cthe fundamental basis and indicium of the conditional nature of the pardon.\u201d [14] She contends that had PGMA intended to issue an absolute pardon, she would have not required Estrada\u2019s acceptance thereof. Having accepted its terms with a commitment of strict compliance, Estrada should be deemed to have breached the \u201ccontract\u201d when he ran for Mayor.\n\nAmidst this argument, the primordial question continues to nag: was the pardon bestowed on Estrada conditional or absolute? For the following reasons, I find that Estrada\u2019s pardon was absolute in nature:\n\nFirst . I am of the view that the acceptance confers effectivity in both absolute and conditional pardon.\nPardon is defined as \u201can act of grace, proceeding from the power entrusted with the execution of the laws, which exempts the individual, on whom it is bestowed, from the punishment the law inflicts for a crime he has committed. It is the private, though official act of the executive magistrate, delivered to the individual for whose benefit it is intended, and not communicated officially to the Court. ... A pardon is a deed, to the validity of which delivery is essential, and delivery is not complete without acceptance.\u201d [15]\nThe fact of Estrada\u2019s acceptance of the pardon, by affixing his signature therein, is an insufficient indication of its conditional nature. Petitioner\u2019s reliance on Cabantag v. Wolf , [16] where the Court ruled that a conditional pardon has no force until accepted by the condemned because the condition may be less acceptable to him than the original punishment and may in fact be more onerous, is misplaced. It merely stated that a conditional pardon must be accepted in the exercise of the pardonee\u2019s right to choose whether to accept or reject the terms of the pardon. It does not operate in the manner suggested by petitioner. It does not work the other way around.\n\nAn \u201cacceptance\u201d does not classify a pardon as conditional just by the mere reception and the placing of an inscription thereon. I am not prepared to ignore the very intention and content of a pardon as standards to determine its nature, as against the mere expediency of its delivery and acceptance. I am much more amenable to the rule consistent with the benevolent nature of pardon: that it is an act of forgiveness predicated on an admission of guilt. To be effective, therefore, this admission of past wrongdoing must be manifested by the acceptance of a pardon, absolute or conditional.\n\nFurther, the significance of \u201cacceptance\u201d is more apparent in cases of \u201ccommutation,\u201d which is the substitution of a lighter punishment for a heavier one. William F. Duker elucidates:\nAlthough for a pardon to be effective it usually must be accepted, commutation is effective without acceptance. In Chapman v. Scott , the President granted a commutation to \u201ctime-served\u201d to a convict so that he would be available for prosecution in a state court on a capital case. The convict refused the commutation and argued that it was not effective until accepted, but the court held that a commutation did not require acceptance:\n\nAlthough power to commute is logically derivable from power to pardon, commutation is essentially different from pardon. Pardon exempts from punishment, bears no relation to term of punishment, and must be accepted, or it is nugatory. Commutation merely substitutes lighter for heavier punishment. It removes no stain, restores no civil privileges, and may be effected without the consent and against the will of the prisoner. [17]\nAs applied to Estrada\u2019s case, his acceptance of the pardon does not necessarily negate its absolute nature. The more appropriate test to apply in the determination of the subject pardon\u2019s character is the grantor\u2019s intention as revealed in the four corners of the document.\n\nSecond . The controversial perambulatory clause which states, \u201cWhereas, Joseph Ejercito Estrada has publicly committed to no longer seek any elective position or office,\u201d should not be considered as a restriction on Estrada\u2019s pardon.\n\nPrimarily, rules on statutory construction provide that whereas clauses, do not form part of a statute, strictly speaking; they are not part of the operative language of the statute. [18] While they may be helpful to the extent that they articulate the general purpose or reason underlying a new enactment, reliance on whereas clauses as aids in construing statutes is not justified when their interpretation \u201ccontrol the specific terms of the statute.\u201d [19]\n\nAs applied in Estrada\u2019s case, the subject whereas clause does not purport to control or modify the unequivocal terms found in the pardon\u2019s body. In this sense, the \u201cwhereas clauses\u201d in Estrada\u2019s pardon cannot adversely affect the ultimate command which it evokes, that is, executive clemency is granted to Estrada absent any condition.\n\nA conditional pardon basically imposes a condition. I take this to mean that it must either stipulate a circumstance, a situation, or a requisite that must come into pass or express a restriction that must not ensue. I find none in this case. The plain language of the pardon extended to Estrada does not set forth any of these. It was couched in a straightforward conferment of pardon, to wit:\nI hereby grant executive clemency to Joseph Ejercito Estrada, convicted by the Sandiganbayan of plunder and imposed a penalty of reclusion perpetua.\nHad PGMA intended to impress a condition on Estrada, the same would have been clearly stated as a requirement of, or restriction to, the above conferment. I am inclined to posit that the extension of a conditional pardon to her political rival is a matter that PGMA would have regarded with solemnity and tact. After all, the pardoning power is a pervasive means to bluntly overrule the force and effect, not only of a court\u2019s judgment of conviction, but the punitive aspect of criminal laws. As it turned out, no direct showing suggests that the pardon was conditional.\n\nFor a condition to be operative, the condition must appear on the face of the document. The conditions must be clear and specific. The reason is that the conditions attached to a pardon should be definite and specific as to inform the person pardoned of what would be required. [20] As no condition was patently evinced in the document, the Court is at no liberty to shape one, only because the plain meaning of the pardon\u2019s text is unacceptable for some waylaid and extraneous reasons. That the executive clemency given to Estrada was unaccompanied by any condition is clearly visible in the text of the pardon. The Court must simply read the pardon as it is written. There is no necessity to resort to construction. I choose to heed the warning enunciated in Yangco v. Court of First Instance of Manila :\n. . . [w]here language is plain, subtle refinements which tinge words so as to give them the color of a particular judicial theory are not only unnecessary but decidedly harmful. That which has caused so much confusion in the law , which has made it so difficult for the public to understand and know what the law is with respect to a given matter, is in considerable measure the unwarranted interference by judicial tribunals with the English language as found in statutes and contracts, cutting the words here and inserting them there, making them fit personal ideas of what the legislature ought to have done or what parties should have agreed upon, giving them meanings which they do not ordinarily have cutting, trimming, fitting, changing and coloring until lawyers themselves are unable to advise their clients as to the meaning of a given statute or contract until it has been submitted to some court for its interpretation and construction. [21]\nSuffice it to say, a statement describing Estrada\u2019s previous commitment not to seek any elective office cannot operate as a condition for his pardon, sans any indication that it was intended to be so. In light of the clear absence of any condition in the pardon, no ambiguity warrants interpretation by the Court. At the most, the subject whereas clause depicts the state of affairs at the time when the pardon was granted. It should not be considered as part and parcel of the entire act as it serves neither the ability to enlarge or confer powers nor the authority to control the words of the act.\n\nThird . The pardoning power is granted exclusively to the President amidst the constitutional scheme of checks and balances. While it is most ideal that the executive strictly adheres to this end, it is undeniable that the pardoning power is still dependent on the grantor\u2019s measure of wisdom and sense of public policy. This reality invites, if not bolsters, the application of the political question doctrine. The only weapon, which the Court has freedom to wield, is the exercise of judicial power against a blatant violation of the Constitution. When unavailing, the Court is constrained to curb its own rebuking power and to uphold the acumen of a co-equal branch. It would do the Court well to remember that neither the Congress nor the courts can question the motives of the President in the use of the power. [22]\n\nHence, in determining the nature of Estrada\u2019s pardon, the Court must undertake a tempered disposition and avoid a strained analysis of the obvious. Where there is no ostensible condition stated in the body of the pardon, to envisage one by way of statutory construction is an inexcusable judicial encroachment.\n\nThe absolute nature of Estrada\u2019s pardon now begets a more astute query: what rights were restored in his favor?\n\nII.\u00a0 Estrada\u2019s Civil and Political Rights Restored\n\nIn this particular issue, the ponencia deserves my full agreement in finding that the third preambular clause of Estrada\u2019s pardon does not militate against the conclusion that Estrada\u2019s rights to suffrage and to seek public office have been restored. Further, the subject pardon had substantially complied with the statutory requirements laid down in Articles 36 and 41 of the RPC. The authority of the said provisions of law was reinforced by the ruling of the Court in Monsanto v. Factoran . A deeper analysis of Monsanto , however, reveals that its repercussions actually favor Estrada.\n\nConsider these points:\nMonsanto involved an absolute pardon, from which, Estrada likewise benefits.\n\nThe issue in Monsanto involved the propriety of an automatic reinstatement to public office. In refutation of the Garland cases, the Court maintained that while an absolute pardon remits all the penal consequences of a criminal indictment if only to give meaning to the fiat that a pardon, being a presidential prerogative ... it, however, rejected the \u201cfictitious belief that pardon blots out the guilt of an individual and that once he is absolved, he should be treated as if he were innocent.\u201d\n\nMonsanto\u2019s absolute disqualification or ineligibility from public office was considered to have formed part of the punishment prescribed against her. Ultimately, when her guilt and punishment were expunged by her pardon, this particular disability was likewise removed.\n\nNoteworthy is the observation of the Court that she may apply for reappointment to the office, but in the appraisal of her suitability to a public post, the facts constituting her past offense should be taken into account to determine whether she could once again serve in a public office.\nAfter serious reflection, I am convinced that the foregoing pronouncement parallels that which should apply to Estrada.\n\nIn Monsanto , the Court declared that the absolute pardon granted to her by the President effectively expunged her disqualification or ineligibility to hold public office because this formed part of the penalty against her. As in the foregoing discussion on the absolute nature of Estrada\u2019s pardon, there is no question that his pardon likewise remitted the punishment previously imposed in his conviction for plunder. As such, he was released from incarceration and thereafter regained his liberty of movement, albeit ordered to abide by the forfeiture of his properties as listed in the judgment of the Sandiganbayan. More significantly, there was no categorical statement impressed in Monsanto that banned her from holding public office again. All that it withheld was an automatic reinstatement to her previous office and her entitlement to backpay. In other words, Monsanto may hold public office provided that there is favorable action on her application.\n\nWhile I generally acquiesce with the scholarly opinions of Justices Padilla and Feliciano in Monsanto , I find it difficult to apply their respective observations (that based on Article 36 of the RPC, it was clear that the pardon extended by the President did not per se entitle Monsanto to again hold public office or to suffrage because nothing therein expressly provided the restoration of the said rights with specifity) precisely because this was not adopted in the majority decision. There is a stark difference between the positions taken by the concurring justices from the very holding of the majority. The former entirely and perpetually denied Monsanto of her right to hold public office, while the latter merely disallowed an automatic reinstatement but permitted her to undergo re-application with the only caveat that her pardon did not place her in a state of complete innocence. In other words, her past conviction should be considered as forming part of her credentials in her re-application for public office. Between these two conclusions, I choose with steadfast belief that the holding pronounced in the majority decision should prevail. The strict interpretation of Article 36 as advocated in the concurring opinion was not adopted in the main decision , hence, rendering the same as mere obiter dictum which has no controlling effect .\n\nWhile I do not subscribe to Estrada\u2019s theory that Articles 36 and 41 of the RPC have the effect of abridging and diminishing the power of the President, I also remain unconvinced that the said provisions of law should apply to his case because the strict interpretation of these provisions were not encapsulated in jurisprudence, particularly Monsanto . Therefore, the statement, \u201cHe is hereby restored to his civil and political rights,\u201d as found in the subject pardon does not fall short of producing the effect of wiping away the penalties being suffered by the pardonee. As things stand now, an absolute and full pardon erases both the principal and accessory penalties meted against him, thereby allowing him to hold public office once again.\n\nCorollary to this, I am of the opinion that PGMA\u2019s failure to use the term \u201cfull,\u201d apropos to the restoration of Estrada\u2019s rights does not denigrate its coverage. PGMA\u2019s omission to use such term in the case of Estrada may have been caused by reasons unknown to the Court. The Court cannot discount the possibility that this was borne out of plain inadvertence, considering the fact that the pardon was unaccompanied by a clear condition. Had it been PGMA\u2019s intention to restrict the rights restored to Estrada, she could have stated clear exceptions thereto, instead of employing a phrase, which, in its plain meaning , comprises the right to vote and to run for public office. Besides, the deprivation of these rights is a dangerous ground that the Court should not tread on, especially when the intention to restrict their exercise is impalpable.\n\nApplying this to the case at bench, no ban from holding public office should be imposed on Estrada, because the absolute pardon given to him had effectively extinguished both the principal and accessory penalties brought forth by his conviction. Succinctly, Estrada\u2019s civil and political rights had been restored in full.\n\nIII.\u00a0 Estrada\u2019s Right to Run for Public Office Restored\n\nConsistent with my view that Monsanto reflects the obliteration of Estrada\u2019s perpetual disqualification, I conclude that he now possesses the right to vote and to run for public office.\n\nLest it be misunderstood, this conclusion does not degenerate from the doctrine that a pardon only relieves a party from the punitive consequences of his past crimes, nothing more. Indeed, \u201ca person adjudged guilty of an offense is a convicted criminal, though pardoned; he may be deserving of punishment, though left unpunished; and the law may regard him as more dangerous to society than one never found guilty of crime, though it places no restraints upon him following his conviction.\u201d [23] Estrada was not reborn into innocence by virtue of the forgiveness bestowed in by the pardon. The moral stain caused by his past crimes remains to be part of his person, then as now. In no way did his pardon serve as a stamp of incorruptibility. It is not a magic spell that superimposes virtuousness over guilt. His past conviction for plunder would forever form part of his person, whether as a private individual or a public officer.\n\nWithout squabble, plunder is a crime involving moral turpitude. Nevertheless, this fact alone negates a mechanical application of statutory provisions on disqualification. One thing is clear, in the exercise of her exclusive power to grant executive clemency, PGMA pardoned Estrada, thereby wiping away the penalties of his crime and entitling him the right to run for public office. Corollary to this, Estrada\u2019s fitness to hold public office is an issue that should not concern the Court. All that the Court can rule on is the availability of Estrada\u2019s right to seek public office. This ruling on his eligibility is not tantamount to a declaration that Estrada befits a person wholly deserving of the people\u2019s trust. The Manile\u00f1os\u2019 decision alone can mould the city\u2019s journey to either development or decline. Indeed, election expresses the sovereign will of the people consistent with the principle of vox populi est suprema lex . This is the beauty of democracy which the Court must endeavour to protect at all cost. As Abraham Lincoln put it with both guile and eloquence,\nElections belong to the people. It's their decision. If they decide to turn their back on the fire and burn their behinds, then they will just have to sit on their blisters.\nFor the foregoing reasons, I vote to CONCUR with the majority opinion.\n\n[1] Rollo . pp. 1009-1034.\n\n[2] Id. at 1035-1054.\n\n[3] Section 4, Article VII 1987 Constitution.\n\n[4] Atty.

By reading an ambiguity in favor of a convicted public officer, impunity is tolerated.\n\nI dissent.\n\nJoseph Ejercito Estrada, former President of the Republic of the Philippines, was found guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of plunder. A heinous crime of the highest order, the law penalizing plunder \u2014 Republic Act No. 7080 \u2014 made possible the imposition of the supreme penalty of death upon public officers who amass ill-gotten wealth on a grand scale through a combination or series of acts. [1] Though an intervening statute [2] now prevents the imposition of the penalty of death, our laws have no less abhorrence for this crime.\n\nJoseph Ejercito Estrada, former President of the Republic of the Philippines, was pardoned shortly after he had been convicted. This case presents to this court a dilemma engendered by ambiguities in the pardon extended to him.\n\nThe court must decide on whether these ambiguities shall be interpreted to benefit a convicted former President, shown to have amassed ill-gotten wealth on a grand scale and to have betrayed the trust given to him through the investiture of the highest office in the land; or to benefit the public which reposes its trust on elected public officials. Many other public officials have been found liable for graft and corrupt practices of far lesser scales than those for which Joseph Ejercito Estrada had been convicted. They now languish in jails, deprived of liberties and entitlements. This case is not about their pardon. They continue to suffer the penalties that their convictions entail, unlike the former President of the Republic of the Philippines.\n\nThis case, in short, will affect the public\u2019s attitude to the Rule of Law and the possibilities for immunity for very influential public officials.\n\nNot having been unequivocally restored to a status worthy of being a repository of the public trust, there is no reason to lavish Joseph Ejercito Estrada by facilitating his reversion to elective public office. Thus, I dissent from the majority decision.\n\nI\n\nThrough a petition for certiorari, Atty. Alicia Risos-Vidal (Risos-Vidal) prays that the assailed resolutions [3] dated April 1, 2013 of the Second Division of public respondent Commission on Elections (COMELEC), and April 23, 2013 of COMELEC, sitting En Banc, be annulled and set aside. In addition, she prays that a new judgment be entered disqualifying private respondent Joseph Ejercito Estrada (Estrada) from running as Mayor of the City of Manila, and cancelling the certificate of candidacy he filed in connection with the May 13, 2013 election for the position of Mayor of the City of Manila. [4]\n\nThe assailed April 1, 2013 resolution dismissed the petition for disqualification filed by Risos-Vidal and docketed as SPA No. 13-211 (DC). The assailed April 23, 2013 resolution denied her motion for reconsideration.\n\nA motion for leave to intervene [5] was filed by Estrada\u2019s opponent in the mayoralty race, Alfredo S. Lim (Lim). Attached to Lim\u2019s motion was his petition-in-intervention. [6] Lim\u2019s motion was granted by the court in the resolution [7] dated June 25, 2013.\n\nII\n\nStatement of the antecedents\n\nOn April 4, 2001, the Office of the Ombudsman filed against private respondent, Joseph Ejercito Estrada, former President of the Republic of the Philippines, and several other accused, [8] an information for plunder, penalized by Republic Act No. 7080, as amended by Republic Act No. 7659. This case was filed before the Sandiganbayan and docketed as Criminal Case No. 26558.\n\nIn the decision [9] dated September 12, 2007, the Sandiganbayan, Special Division, convicted Estrada of the crime of plunder. He was sentenced to suffer \u201cthe penalty of Reclusion Perpetua and the accessory penalties of civil interdiction during the period of sentence and perpetual absolute disqualification.\u201d [10]\n\nThe dispositive portion of this decision reads:\nWHEREFORE, in view of all the foregoing, judgment is hereby rendered in Criminal Case No. 26558 finding the accused, Former President Joseph Ejercito Estrada, GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of PLUNDER defined in and penalized by Republic Act No. 7080, as amended. On the other hand, for failure of the prosecution to prove and establish their guilt beyond reasonable doubt, the Court finds the accused Jose \u201cJinggoy\u201d Estrada and Atty. Edward S. Serapio NOT GUILTY of the crime of plunder, and accordingly, the Court hereby orders their ACQUITTAL.\n\nThe penalty imposable for the crime of plunder under Republic Act No. 7080, [11] as amended by Republic Act No. 7659, [12] is Reclusion Perpetua to Death. There being no aggravating or mitigating circumstances, however, the lesser penalty shall be applied in accordance with Article 63 of the Revised Penal Code. [13] Accordingly, the accused Former President Joseph Ejercito Estrada is hereby sentenced to suffer the penalty of Reclusion Perpetua and the accessory penalties of civil interdiction during the period of sentence and perpetual absolute disqualification .\n\nThe period within which accused Former President Joseph Ejercito Estrada has been under detention shall be credited to him in full as long as he agrees voluntarily in writing to abide by the same disciplinary rules imposed upon convicted prisoners.\n\nMoreover, in accordance with Section 2 of Republic Act No. 7080, as amended by Republic Act No. 7659, the Court hereby declares the forfeiture in favor of the government of the following:\n(1) The total amount of Five Hundred Forty Two Million Seven Ninety One Thousand Pesos (?545,291,000.00) [14] with interest and income earned, inclusive of the amount of Two Hundred Million Pesos (?200,000,000.00), deposited in the name and account of the Erap Muslim Youth Foundation.\n\n(2) The amount of One Hundred Eighty Nine Million Pesos (P189,000,000.00), inclusive of interests and income earned, deposited in the Jose Velarde account.\n\n(3) The real property consisting of a house and lot dubbed as \u201cBoracay Mansion\u201d located at #100 11th Street, New Manila, Quezon City.\nThe cash bonds posted by accused Jose \u201cJinggoy\u201d Estrada and Atty. Edward S. Serapio are hereby ordered cancelled and released to the said accused or their duly authorized representatives upon presentation of the original receipt evidencing payment thereof and subject to the usual accounting and auditing procedures. Likewise, the hold-departure orders issued against the said accused are hereby recalled and declared functus officio.\n\nSO ORDERED. [15] (Emphasis and citations supplied)\nOn October 25, 2007, then President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo granted pardon to Estrada. The complete text of this pardon reads:\nMALACA\u00d1AN PALACE\nMANILA\n________________________________________\n\nBy the President of the Philippines\n\nPARDON\n________________________________________\n\nWHEREAS, this Administration has a policy of releasing inmates who have reached the age of seventy (70),\n\nWHEREAS, Joseph Ejercito Estrada has been under detention for six and a half years,\n\nWHEREAS, Joseph Ejercito Estrada has publicly committed to no longer seek any elective position or office,\n\nIN VIEW HEREOF and pursuant to the authority conferred upon me by the Constitution, I hereby grant executive clemency to JOSEPH EJERCITO ESTRADA, convicted by the Sandiganbayan of Plunder and imposed a penalty of Reclusion Perpetua. He is hereby restored to his civil and political rights.\n\nThe forfeitures imposed by the Sandiganbayan remain in force and in full, including all writs and processes issued by the Sandiganbayan in pursuance hereof, except for the bank account(s) he owned before his tenure as President.\n\nUpon acceptance of this pardon by JOSEPH EJERCITO ESTRADA, this pardon shall take effect.\n\nGiven under my hand at the City of Manila,\nthis 25 th Day of October, in the year of\nOur Lord, two thousand and seven.\n\nGloria M. Arroyo (sgd.)\n\nBy the President:\n\nIGNACIO R. BUNYE (sgd.)\nActing Executive Secretary [16]\nOn October 26, 2007, Estrada accepted the entire pardon without qualifications. This acceptance is evidenced by a handwritten notation on the pardon, which reads:\n\nReceived & accepted\n\nJoseph E. Estrada (sgd.)\nDATE: 26 Oct. \u201807\nTIME: 3:35 P.M. [17]\n\nOn October 2, 2012, Estrada filed his certificate of candidacy [18] for the position of Mayor of the City of Manila.\n\nOn January 14, 2013, Risos-Vidal, a resident and registered voter of the City of Manila, filed before public respondent COMELEC a petition for disqualification [19] against Estrada. This petition, docketed as SPA No. 13-211 (DC), was filed pursuant to Section 40 of Republic Act No. 7160, otherwise known as the Local Government Code of 1991 (the Local Government Code), [20] in relation to Section 12 of Batas Pambansa Blg. 881, otherwise known as the Omnibus Election Code. [21] It sought to disqualify Estrada from running for Mayor of the City of Manila on account of his conviction for plunder and having been sentenced to suffer the penalty of reclusion perpetua, and the accessory penalties of civil interdiction and perpetual absolute disqualification. [22]\n\nEstrada filed his answer [23] on January 24, 2013.\n\nOn April 1, 2013, the COMELEC Second Division issued the first assailed resolution dismissing Risos-Vidal\u2019s petition for lack of merit.\n\nIn this resolution, the COMELEC Second Division noted that in 2010, following Estrada\u2019s filing of a certificate of candidacy for President of the Philippines, two disqualification cases \u2014 SPA No. 09-028 (DC) and SPA No. 09-104 (DC) \u2014 were filed against him. It added that, in deciding these disqualification cases \u2014 first, through the resolution dated January 20, 2010 of the COMELEC Second Division and, second, through the resolution of the COMELEC En Banc dated May 4, 2010 \u2014 the Commission on Elections had already ruled that the pardon granted to Estrada was absolute and unconditional and, hence, did not prevent him from running for public office. Thus, the matter of Estrada\u2019s qualification, in relation to the efficacy of the penalties imposed on him on account of his conviction for plunder, \u201cha[d] been passed upon and ruled out by this Commission way back in 2010.\u201d [24]\n\nIn the resolution dated April 23, 2013, the COMELEC En Banc denied Risos-Vidal\u2019s motion for reconsideration.\n\nOn April 30, 2013, Risos-Vidal filed the present petition. [25] Risos-Vidal ascribed grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction on COMELEC in not disqualifying Estrada. She assailed COMELEC\u2019s refusal to grant her petition on account of its having supposedly ruled on the same issues in the disqualification cases filed in connection with Estrada\u2019s 2010 bid for the presidency. [26] She asserted that Estrada\u2019s pardon was conditional and served neither to restore his rights \u201cto vote, be voted upon and to hold public office\u201d [27] nor to remit the accessory penalty of perpetual absolute disqualification. [28] She added that, for having been convicted of plunder, a crime involving moral turpitude, Estrada was barred from running for Mayor by Section 40 of the Local Government Code. [29] Insisting that the grounds for disqualifying Estrada were so manifest, she faulted COMELEC for not having disqualified motu proprio. [30]\n\nIn the meantime, elections were conducted on May 13, 2013. Per COMELEC\u2019s \u201cCertificate of Canvass of Votes and Proclamation of Winning Candidates for National Capital Region \u2013 Manila\u201d dated May 17, 2013, [31] Estrada was noted to have obtained 349,770 votes. [32] His opponent in the mayoralty race, Lim, obtained 313,764 votes, [33] giving the lead to Estrada. Estrada was, thus, proclaimed as the \u201cduly elected\u201d [34] city mayor.\n\nOn June 7, 2013, Lim filed a motion for leave to intervene [35] to which was attached his petition-in-intervention. [36] He argued that, regardless of whether the pardon granted to Estrada was absolute or conditional, it did not expressly restore his right of suffrage and his right to hold public office, and it did not remit his perpetual absolute disqualification as required by Articles 36 [37] and 41 [38] of the Revised Penal Code. Thus, he remained ineligible for election into public office. [39] He added that, per this court\u2019s decision in Dominador Jalosjos, Jr. v. COMELEC , [40] he had the \u201cright to be declared and proclaimed mayor of Manila upon the declaration of respondent Estrada\u2019s disqualification.\u201d [41]\n\nIn the resolution [42] dated June 25, 2013, this court granted Lim\u2019s motion for leave to intervene and required respondents to file their comments on Lim\u2019s petition-in-intervention in addition to filing their comment on Risos-Vidal\u2019s petition.\n\nOn July 15, 2013, Estrada filed his comment on Lim\u2019s petition-in-intervention. [43] He argued that Lim lacked \u201clegal standing to prosecute this case,\u201d [44] that the pardon granted to him restored his right to seek public office, [45] and that Articles 36 and 41 of the Revised Penal Code are not only unconstitutional, as they diminish the pardoning power of the President, [46] but have also been repealed by subsequent election laws (e.g., Section 94 of Commonwealth Act No. 357 [47] and Section 12 of the Omnibus Election Code [48] ), which recognize \u201cplenary pardon[s].\u201d He added that Risos-Vidal\u2019s assertions that President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo could not have intended for Estrada\u2019s pardon to be absolute as they were \u201cpolitical rivals\u201d [49] is a factual issue that required the \u201cremand\u201d [50] of the case to the Court of Appeals or the reception of evidence through oral arguments. [51]\n\nOn July 29, 2013, public respondent COMELEC, through the Office of the Solicitor General (OSG) filed its consolidated comment. [52] It noted that the effects of the pardon granted to Estrada had already been ruled upon by COMELEC in connection with disqualification cases filed against him on the occasion of his 2010 bid for the presidency. [53] It added that Estrada\u2019s rights to vote and be voted for had indeed been restored and his perpetual disqualification remitted by the pardon granted to him.\n\nOn August 6, 2013, Estrada filed his comment [54] on Risos-Vidal\u2019s petition. In addition to arguing that he was granted an absolute pardon which rendered him eligible to run and be voted as mayor, Estrada argued that the present case involves the same issues as those in the 2010 disqualification cases filed against him, that \u201cthe findings of fact of the public respondent COMELEC relative to the absoluteness of the pardon, the effects thereof and the eligibility of the Private Respondent Estrada are binding and conclusive\u201d [55] on this court, and that the allegations made by Risos-Vidal are insufficient to disturb the assailed resolutions. [56] He added that Risos-Vidal\u2019s petition before the COMELEC was filed out of time, it being, in reality, a petition to deny due course to or to cancel his certificate of candidacy, and not a petition for disqualification. [57] He also asserted that Dominador Jalosjos, Jr. was inapplicable to the present case. [58] Finally, he claimed that his disqualification would mean the disenfranchisement of the voters who elected him. [59]\n\nOn August 23, 2013, Lim filed his reply to Estrada\u2019s comment on his petition-in-intervention and to COMELEC\u2019s consolidated comment. [60] On August 27, 2013, Risos-Vidal filed her reply [61] to Estrada\u2019s comment on her petition. On December 13, 2013, Risos-Vidal filed her reply [62] to COMELEC\u2019s consolidated comment.\n\nIn the resolution dated April 22, 2014, the petition and petition-in-intervention were given due course and the parties required to submit their memoranda. The parties complied: Lim on May 27, 2014, [63] Risos-Vidal on June 2, 2014, [64] Estrada on June 16, 2014; [65] and COMELEC on June 26, 2014. [66]\n\nIII\n\nStatement of issues\n\nFor resolution are the following issues:\n\nA. Procedural issues\nWhether the petition filed by petitioner Atty. Alicia Risos-Vidal before the COMELEC was filed on time;\n\nWhether petitioner-intervenor Alfredo S. Lim may intervene in this case; and\n\nWhether COMELEC\u2019s rulings in the disqualification cases filed against private respondent Joseph Ejercito Estrada in connection with his 2010 bid for the presidency bar the consideration of the petition filed by petitioner Atty. Alicia Risos-Vidal before the COMELEC, as well as the present petition for certiorari.\nB. Substantive issues\nWhether private respondent Joseph Ejercito Estrada was qualified to run for Mayor of the City of Manila; and\n\nAssuming private respondent Joseph Ejercito Estrada was not qualified, whether petitioner-intervenor Alfredo S. Lim should be declared Mayor of the City of Manila.\nAt the core of this case is the issue of whether Estrada was qualified to run for Mayor of the City of Manila. Estrada, however, has invoked several procedural issues that, if decided in his favor, would effectively impede this court\u2019s having to rule on the substantive issue of his qualification. All of these procedural obstacles lack merit and should not prevent this court from ruling on Estrada\u2019s qualification.\n\nIV\n\nThe petition filed by petitioner Atty. Alicia Risos-Vidal with COMELEC was filed on time\n\nEstrada argues that the petition filed by Risos-Vidal before the COMELEC should be treated as a petition to deny due course to or to cancel a certificate of candidacy (CoC) under Section 78 of Batas Pambansa Blg. 881, otherwise known as the Omnibus Election Code [67] (Section 78 petition). He claims that the petition effectively assailed the falsity of a representation he made in his CoC \u2014 that is, that he was eligible for the office he sought to be elected to \u2014 and, therefore, invoked a ground for a Section 78 petition, rather than a ground for a petition for disqualification.\n\nEstrada adds that Rule 23, Section 2 of COMELEC Resolution No. 9523 [68] provides that a Section 78 petition must be filed within five (5) days from the last day for filing a CoC, but not later than 25 days from the time of the filing of the CoC specifically subject of the petition. He claims that, since Risos-Vidal\u2019s petition was all but a \u201ccamouflaged\u201d [69] petition for disqualification, Rule 25, Section 3 of COMELEC Resolution No. 9523, [70] which allows for petitions for disqualification to be \u201cfiled any day after the last day for filing of certificates of candidacy, but not later than the date of proclamation\u201d finds no application. As Risos-Vidal\u2019s petition was filed before the COMELEC on January 14, 2013 \u2014 one hundred and four (104) days removed from October 2, 2012, when he filed his CoC \u2014 Estrada argues that Risos-Vidal\u2019s petition was belatedly filed and, hence, should have been summarily dismissed by COMELEC.\n\nEstrada\u2019s assertion is erroneous.\n\nThis court\u2019s 2008 decision in Fermin v. COMELEC [71] allowed for an opportunity \u201cto dichotomize, once and for all, two popular remedies to prevent a candidate from running for an elective position which are indiscriminately interchanged by the Bench and the Bar\u201d: [72] on the one hand, a petition to deny due course to or to cancel a certificate of candidacy under Section 78 of the Omnibus Election Code and, on the other, a petition for disqualification under Section 68 of the Omnibus Election Code (Section 68 petition).\n\nThe two remedies, and their distinctions, were discussed in the course of this court\u2019s characterization of the petition involved in Fermin \u2014 whether it was a Section 78 petition or a Section 68 petition \u2014 considering that such petition was anchored on an allegation that a candidate for Mayor was ineligible for failing to satisfy the requirement of residency of at least one (1) year immediately preceding the election. The problem of characterization is the same issue facing us at this juncture:\nLest it be misunderstood, the denial of due course to or the cancellation of the CoC is not based on the lack of qualifications but on a finding that the candidate made a material representation that is false, which may relate to the qualifications required of the public office he/she is running for. It is noted that the candidate states in his/her CoC that he/she is eligible for the office he/she seeks. Section 78 of the OEC, therefore, is to be read in relation to the constitutional and statutory provisions on qualifications or eligibility for public office. If the candidate subsequently states a material representation in the CoC that is false, the COMELEC, following the law, is empowered to deny due course to or cancel such certificate. Indeed, the Court has already likened a proceeding under Section 78 to a quo warranto proceeding under Section 253 of the OEC since they both deal with the eligibility or qualification of a candidate, with the distinction mainly in the fact that a \u201cSection 78\u201d petition is filed before proclamation, while a petition for quo warranto is filed after proclamation of the winning candidate.\n\nAt this point, we must stress that a \" Section 78 \" petition ought not to be interchanged or confused with a \" Section 68 \" petition. They are different remedies, based on different grounds, and resulting in different eventualities . . . .\n\nThe ground raised in the Dilangalen petition is that Fermin allegedly lacked one of the qualifications to be elected as mayor of Northern Kabuntalan, i.e. , he had not established residence in the said locality for at least one year immediately preceding the election. Failure to meet the one-year residency requirement for the public office is not a ground for the \"disqualification\" of a candidate under Section 68. [Section 68] only refers to the commission of prohibited acts and the possession of a permanent resident status in a foreign country as grounds for disqualification , thus:\nSEC. 68. Disqualifications.\u2013Any candidate who, in an action or protest in which he is a party is declared by final decision of a competent court guilty of, or found by the Commission of having (a) given money or other material consideration to influence, induce or corrupt the voters or public officials performing electoral functions; (b) committed acts of terrorism to enhance his candidacy; (c) spent in his election campaign an amount in excess of that allowed by this Code; (d) solicited, received or made any contribution prohibited under Sections 89, 95, 96, 97 and 104; or (e) violated any of Sections 80, 83, 85, 86 and 261, paragraphs d, e, k, v, and cc, subparagraph 6, shall be disqualified from continuing as a candidate, or if he has been elected, from holding the office. Any person who is a permanent resident of or an immigrant to a foreign country shall not be qualified to run for any elective office under this Code, unless said person has waived his status as a permanent resident or immigrant of a foreign country in accordance with the residence requirement provided for in the election laws.\nLikewise, the other provisions of law referring to \"disqualification\" do not include the lack of the one-year residency qualification as a ground therefor, thus:\n\nSection 12 of the OEC\nSEC. 12. Disqualifications.\u2013Any person who has been declared by competent authority insane or incompetent, or has been sentenced by final judgment for subversion, insurrection, rebellion, or for any offense for which he has been sentenced to a penalty of more than eighteen months or for a crime involving moral turpitude, shall be disqualified to be a candidate and to hold any office, unless he has been given plenary pardon or granted amnesty.\n\nThe disqualifications to be a candidate herein provided shall be deemed removed upon the declaration by competent authority that said insanity or incompetence had been removed or after the expiration of a period of five years from his service or sentence, unless within the same period he again becomes disqualified.\nSection 40 of the Local Government Code (LGC)\nSECTION 40. Disqualifications\u2013The following persons are disqualified from running for any elective local position:\n\n(a) Those sentence by final judgment for an offense involving moral turpitude or for an offense punishable by one (1) year or more of imprisonment, within two (2) years after serving sentence;\n\n(b) Those removed from office as a result of an administrative case;\n\n(c) Those convicted by final judgment for violating the oath of allegiance to the Republic;\n\n(d) Those with dual citizenship;\n\n(e) Fugitive from justice in criminal or nonpolitical cases here or abroad;\n\n(f) Permanent residents in a foreign country or those who have acquired the right to reside abroad and continue to avail of the same right after the effectivity of this Code; and\n\n(g) The insane or feeble-minded.\nConsidering that the Dilangalen petition does not state any of these grounds for disqualification, it cannot be categorized as a \"Section 68\" petition.\n\nTo emphasize, a petition for disqualification, on the one hand, can be premised on Section 12 or 68 of the [Omnibus Election Code], or Section 40 of the [Local Government Code] . On the other hand, a petition to deny due course to or cancel a CoC can only be grounded on a statement of a material representation in the said certificate that is false. . . . [73] (Emphasis supplied, citations omitted)\nThe quoted discussion clearly establishes the distinction of when it is proper to resort to a Section 78 petition as against a petition for disqualification under Section 68 of the Omnibus Election Code: (1) a Section 78 petition is proper when a statement of a material representation in a certificate of candidacy is false; and (2) a Section 68 petition is proper when disqualification is sought on account of having committed electoral offenses and/or possession of status as a permanent resident in a foreign country.\n\nFermin , however, did not just touch on petitions for disqualification anchored on Section 68 of the Omnibus Election Code, but also on petitions for disqualification anchored on Section 12 of the Omnibus Election Code and on Section 40 of the Local Government Code. Fermin made the pronouncement that Section 12 of the Omnibus Election Code and Section 40 of the Local Government Code are equally valid grounds for a petition for disqualification. Nevertheless, Fermin was not categorical on when a petition for disqualification anchored on these statutory provisions may be resorted to vis-\u00e0-vis a Section 78 petition.\n\nA subsequent case, Aratea v. COMELEC , [74] affirms that petitions for disqualification may be anchored on Section 12 of the Omnibus Election Code, and/or Section 40 of the Local Government Code, much as they can be anchored on Section 68 of the Omnibus Election Code: \u201cA petition for disqualification can only be premised on a ground specified in Section 12 or 68 of the Omnibus Election Code or Section 40 of the Local Government Code.\u201d [75]\n\nLikewise, Rule 25, Section 1 of COMELEC Resolution No. 9523 indicates that a petition for disqualification is based on legally ( i.e. , by Constitution or by statute) prescribed disqualifications. It provides:\nSection 1. Grounds. \u2014 Any candidate who, in an action or protest in which he is a party, is declared by final decision of a competent court, guilty of, or found by the Commission to be suffering from any disqualification provided by law or the Constitution .\n\nA Petition to Disqualify a Candidate invoking grounds for a Petition to Deny to or Cancel a Certificate of Candidacy or Petition to Declare a Candidate as a Nuisance Candidate, or a combination thereof, shall be summarily dismissed. (Emphasis supplied)\nHowever, Aratea and COMELEC Resolution No. 9523, like Fermin , are uncategorical on the availability of petitions for disqualification anchored on Section 12 of the Omnibus Election Code and/or Section 40 of the Local Government Code vis-\u00e0-vis resort to Section 78 petitions. Any standing ambiguity was settled by this court\u2019s discussion in Dominador Jalosjos, Jr. v. Commission on Elections . [76]\n\nIn Dominador Jalosjos, Jr. , this court affirmed the COMELEC\u2019s grant of a Section 78 petition and sustained the cancellation of the certificate of candidacy filed by Dominador Jalosjos, Jr. in his bid to be elected Mayor of Dapitan City, Zamboanga del Norte in the May 10, 2010 elections. This cancellation was premised on a finding that Jalosjos, Jr. made a material misrepresentation in his CoC in stating that he was eligible for election. Jalosjos, Jr. had previously been convicted of robbery and sentenced to suffer the accessory penalty of perpetual special disqualification. In sustaining the cancellation of his CoC, this court reasoned:\nThe perpetual special disqualification against Jalosjos arising from his criminal conviction by final judgment is a material fact involving eligibility which is a proper ground for a petition under Section 78 of the Omnibus Election Code.\n\n. . . .\n\nA false statement in a certificate of candidacy that a candidate is eligible to run for public office is a false material representation which is a ground for a petition under Section 78 of the same Code. . . .\n\n. . . .\n\nSection 74 requires the candidate to state under oath in his certificate of candidacy \"that he is eligible for said office.\" A candidate is eligible if he has a right to run for the public office. If a candidate is not actually eligible because he is barred by final judgment in a criminal case from running for public office, and he still states under oath in his certificate of candidacy that he is eligible to run for public office, then the candidate clearly makes a false material representation that is a ground for a petition under Section 78. [77] (Citations omitted)\nFrom these, it is clear that a false claim of eligibility made in a certificate of candidacy despite a prior conviction which carries with it the accessory penalty of disqualification is a ground for a Section 78 petition. Nevertheless, it is also a ground for a petition for disqualification . As explained in Dominador Jalosjos, Jr. :\nWhat is indisputably clear is that the false material representation of Jalosjos is a ground for a petition under Section 78. However, since the false material representation arises from a crime penalized by prisi\u00f3n mayor, a petition under Section 12 of the Omnibus Election Code or Section 40 of the Local Government Code can also be properly filed . The petitioner has a choice whether to anchor his petition on Section 12 or Section 78 of the Omnibus Election Code, or on Section 40 of the Local Government Code. The law expressly provides multiple remedies and the choice of which remedy to adopt belongs to the petitioner. [78]\nThe concurrent availability of a Section 78 petition with a petition for disqualification should not be interpreted as diminishing the distinction between the two (2) remedies.\n\nThe pivotal consideration in a Section 78 petition is material misrepresentation relating to qualifications for elective public office. To \u201cmisrepresent\u201d is \u201cto describe (someone or something) in a false way especially in order to deceive someone .\u201d [79] It, therefore, connotes malevolent intent or bad faith that impels one to adulterate information. A Section 78 petition thus, squarely applies to instances in which a candidate is fully aware of a matter of fact that disqualifies him or her but conceals or otherwise falsely depicts that fact as to make it appear that he or she is qualified. A petition for disqualification, on the other hand, may apply in cases where a disqualification exists but, because of an attendant ambiguity (such as an unsettled legal question), a candidate acts in good faith and without any deliberate attempt to conceal or mislead .\n\nRight at the onset, the petition filed by Risos-Vidal before the COMELEC on January 14, 2013 asserts that it was filed pursuant to Section 40 of the Local Government Code, \u201cin relation to\u201d [80] Section 12 of the Omnibus Election Code:\nThis is a petition pursuant to Sec. 40 of R.A. No. 7160, otherwise known as \u201cThe Local Government Code of 1991\u201d, in relation to Sec. 12 of BP Blg. 881, otherwise known as the \u201cOmnibus Election Code of the Philippines\u201d , seeking to disqualify former President Joseph Ejercito Estrada from running for the mayoralty position in Manila in the coming May 13, 2013 elections, on the ground of his prior conviction of the crime of plunder by the Sandiganbayan and his having been sentenced to reclusion perpetua with the accessory penalties of civil interdiction and perpetual absolute disqualification. [81] (Emphasis supplied)\nThis petition posits that Estrada is disqualified from running as Mayor of the City of Manila, pursuant to Section 40 of the Local Government Code, as follows:\nSec. 40 of the LGC provides that a person sentenced by final judgment for an offense involving moral turpitude or for an offense punishable by imprisonment of one (1) year or more is disqualified from running for any elective local position.\n\nAs earlier said, respondent was sentenced in Crim. Case No. 26558 to suffer the penalty of reclusion perpetua.\n\nHe was, however, granted pardon by former Pres. Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo, thus, did not serve his sentence in full.\n\nNonetheless, while the pardon did restore to him his civil and political rights, it did not restore to him his right to run for or hold public office or the right of suffrage because it was not expressly restored by the terms of the pardon. . . . [82]\nThis petition unambiguously anchors itself on statutorily prescribed disqualifications \u2014 under Section 40 of the Local Government Code, as well as Section 12 of the Omnibus Election Code \u2014 which jurisprudence has explicitly recognized as a valid basis for both a petition for disqualification and a Section 78 petition.\n\nIt follows that the petition was filed on time. The petition was filed on January 14, 2013, after the last day for filing of certificates of candidacy, and before the date of Estrada\u2019s proclamation as Mayor on May 17, 2013. This is within the period permitted by Rule 25, Section 3 of COMELEC Resolution No. 9523.\n\nV\n\nAlfredo S. Lim may intervene in the present petition for certiorari\n\nCiting Section 44 of the Local Government Code [83] \u2014 on succession in case of permanent vacancies in the Office of the Mayor \u2014 and jurisprudence to the effect that \u201cthe candidate who obtains the second highest number of votes may not be proclaimed winner in case the winning candidate is disqualified,\u201d [84] Estrada claims that \u201cthe party who stands to benefit in the event of [his] disqualification is none other than the duly elected Vice-Mayor of the City of Manila, Isko Moreno.\u201d [85] Thus, he asserts that \u201cit is clear that Lim has NO LEGAL STANDING to institute his Petition-In-Intervention.\u201d [86]\n\nIn the first place, Estrada is erroneously invoking the concept of \u201clegal standing.\u201d What Estrada is really questioning is whether Lim is a real party in interest.\n\nThe distinction between the rule on standing and real party in interest was extensively discussed by this court in Kilosbayan v. Morato : [87]\nNot only is petitioners' standing a legal issue that may be determined again in this case. It is, strictly speaking, not even the issue in this case, since standing is a concept in constitutional law and here no constitutional question is actually involved . The issue in this case is whether petitioners are the \"real parties in interest\" within the meaning of Rule 3, \u00a72 of the Rules of Court which requires that \"Every action must be prosecuted and defended in the name of the real party in interest.\"\n\nThe difference between the rule on standing and real party in interest has been noted by authorities thus: \"It is important to note . . . that standing because of its constitutional and public policy underpinnings, is very different from questions relating to whether a particular plaintiff is the real party in interest or has capacity to sue. Although all three requirements are directed towards ensuring that only certain parties can maintain an action, standing restrictions require a partial consideration of the merits, as well as broader policy concerns relating to the proper role of the judiciary in certain areas . (FRIEDENTHAL, KANE AND MILLER, CIVIL PROCEDURE 328 (1985))\n\nStanding is a special concern in constitutional law because in some cases suits are brought not by parties who have been personally injured by the operation of a law or by official action taken, but by concerned citizens, taxpayers or voters who actually sue in the public interest . Hence the question in standing is whether such parties have \"alleged such a personal stake in the outcome of the controversy as to assure that concrete adverseness which sharpens the presentation of issues upon which the court so largely depends for illumination of difficult constitutional questions.\" ( Baker v. Carr , 369 U.S. 186, 7 L.Ed. 2d 633 (1962))\n\n. . . .\n\nOn the other hand, the question as to \"real party in interest\" is whether he is \"the party who would be benefitted or injured by the judgment, or the `party entitled to the avails of the suit.'\" ( Salonga v. Warner Barnes & Co., Ltd. , 88 Phil. 125, 131 (1951)) [88] (Emphasis supplied)\nIn seeking to intervene, Lim has made no pretensions of acting as a representative of the general public and, thus, advancing the public interest. He merely prays that he be declared the elected Mayor of the City of Manila following a declaration that Estrada was disqualified to run for the same post. Though what is involved is a public office, what Lim seeks to enforce is, fundamentally, a (supposed) right accruing to him personally to assume an office.\n\nLim has enough interest at stake in this case as would enable him to intervene.\n\nRule 19, Section 1 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure provides for who may intervene in a pending court action:\nSection 1. Who may intervene. \u2014 A person who has a legal interest in the matter in litigation , or in the success of either of the parties, or an interest against both, or is so situated as to be adversely affected by a distribution or other disposition of property in the custody of the court or of an officer thereof may, with leave of court, be allowed to intervene in the action . The court shall consider whether or not the intervention will unduly delay or prejudice the adjudication of the rights of the original parties, and whether or not the intervenor's rights may be fully protected in a separate proceeding. (Emphasis supplied)\nThe requirement of \u201clegal interest\u201d was discussed in Magsaysay-Labrador v. Court of Appeals , [89] as follows:\nThe interest which entitles a person to intervene in a suit between other parties must be in the matter in litigation and of such direct and immediate character that the intervenor will either gain or lose by the direct legal operation and effect of the judgment . Otherwise, if persons not parties of the action could be allowed to intervene, proceedings will become unnecessarily complicated, expensive and interminable. And this is not the policy of the law.\n\nThe words \"an interest in the subject\" mean a direct interest in the cause of action as pleaded, and which would put the intervenor in a legal position to litigate a fact alleged in the complaint, without the establishment of which plaintiff could not recover. [90] (Emphasis supplied)\nIt is true that the principal matter for resolution in this case is whether Estrada, based on circumstances personally applying to him, was qualified to run for Mayor of the City of Manila. Nevertheless, the logical consequence of a decision adverse to Estrada is the need to identify who shall, henceforth, assume the position of Mayor.\n\nLim claims that he is entitled to replace Estrada. In support of this, he cites a decision of this court [91] and claims that, as a disqualified candidate, the votes cast for Estrada should be deemed stray votes. This would result in Lim being the qualified candidate obtaining the highest number of votes, which would, in turn, entitle him to being proclaimed the elected Mayor of the City of Manila.\n\nIt is worth emphasizing that \u201c[t]he purpose of intervention is to enable a stranger to an action to become a party in order for him to protect his interest and for the court to settle all conflicting claims. Intervention is allowed to avoid multiplicity of suits more than on due process considerations.\u201d [92] Lim\u2019s intervention serves this purpose. It enables the resolution of an issue which is corollary to one of the two ways by which this court may decide on the issue of Estrada\u2019s disqualification.\n\nVI\n\nThis case is not barred by COMELEC\u2019s rulings in the disqualification cases filed against Estrada in connection with his 2010 bid for the presidency\n\na. Estrada\u2019s theory: case is barred by res judicata\n\nEstrada avers that in 2010, in connection with what was then his second bid for the presidency of the Republic, two (2) disqualification cases were filed against him: one, by a certain Atty. Evilio C. Pormento, docketed as SPA No. 09-028 (DC); and two, by a certain Mary Lou B. Estrada, docketed as SPA No. 09-104 (DC). In the resolution dated January 20, 2010, [93] the COMELEC Second Division denied these disqualification petitions for lack of merit and upheld Estrada\u2019s qualification to run for President. In the resolution dated April 27, 2010, [94] the COMELEC En Banc denied Mary Lou B. Estrada\u2019s motion for reconsideration. In another resolution dated May 4, 2010, the COMELEC En Banc denied Pormento\u2019s motion for reconsideration. [95]\n\nEstrada claims that \u201c[t]he issue surrounding the character of [his] pardon and eligibility to seek public elective office was already extensively dealt with and passed upon\u201d [96] in these disqualification cases. He asserts that as these cases involved and resolved \u201cthe same or identical issues,\u201d [97] the present case is now barred by res judicata.\n\nEstrada draws particular attention to the following pronouncement of the COMELEC Second Division in its January 20, 2010 resolution:\nFurthermore, there is absolutely no indication that the executive clemency exercised by President Arroyo to pardon Former President Estrada was a mere conditional pardon. It clearly stated that the former president is \u201crestored to his civil and political rights\u201d and there is nothing in the same which limits this restoration. The only therein stated that may have some bearing on the supposed conditions is that statement in the whereas clause thereof that contained the following: \u201cWHEREAS, Joseph Ejercito Estrada has publicly committed to no longer seek any elective position or office\u201d, but that is not really a condition but is merely part of a preliminary statement, referring to what respondent Estrada had said publicly. There is nothing stated in the dispositive part that it was conditioned upon said respondent\u2019s purported public commitment. His public statement cannot, therefore, serve to restrict the operation of, or prevail over the explicit statement in the executive clemency which restored all of Estrada\u2019s civil and political rights, including \u201cthe right to vote and to be voted for a public office,\u201d including to the position of the Presidency. This executive clemency granted to the former President being absolute and unconditional and having been accepted by him, the same can no longer be revoked or be made subject to a condition. [98]\nb. The 2010 disqualification cases and Risos-Vidal\u2019s petition are anchored on different causes of action and, hence, involve different issues and subject matters\n\nRes judicata was discussed in Pryce Corporation v. China Banking Corporation [99] as follows:\nAccording to the doctrine of res judicata, \"a final judgment or decree on the merits by a court of competent jurisdiction is conclusive of the rights of the parties or their privies in all later suits on all points and matters determined in the former suit.\"\n\nThe elements for res judicata to apply are as follows: (a) the former judgment was final; (b) the court that rendered it had jurisdiction over the subject matter and the parties; (c) the judgment was based on the merits; and (d) between the first and the second actions, there was an identity of parties, subject matters, and causes of action.\n\nRes judicata embraces two concepts: (1) bar by prior judgment and (2) conclusiveness of judgment.\n\nBar by prior judgment exists \"when, as between the first case where the judgment was rendered and the second case that is sought to be barred, there is identity of parties, subject matter, and causes of action.\"\n\nOn the other hand, the concept of conclusiveness of judgment finds application \"when a fact or question has been squarely put in issue, judicially passed upon, and adjudged in a former suit by a court of competent jurisdiction.\" This principle only needs identity of parties and issues to apply. [100]\nThe 2010 disqualification cases filed against Estrada in connection with his 2010 bid for the presidency do not bar the present case on account of res judicata.\n\nFor one, the 2010 disqualification cases filed by Atty. Evilio C. Pormento and Mary Lou B. Estrada involved issues and were anchored on causes of action that are markedly different from those in the present case. These cases were anchored on the constitutional prohibition against a President\u2019s re-election, as provided by Article VII, Section 4 of the 1987 Constitution, [101] and the additional ground that Estrada was a nuisance candidate. To the contrary, the present case is anchored on Estrada\u2019s conviction for plunder which carried with it the accessory penalty of perpetual absolute disqualification and invokes Section 40 of the Local Government Code, as well as Section 12 of the Omnibus Election Code.\n\nThe COMELEC Second Division, summarizing the circumstances of the petition for disqualification subject of SPA No. 09-028 (DC), filed by Atty. Evilio C. Pormento, stated:\nPetitioner Evilio C. Pormento filed the first case against Respondent Joseph Ejercito Estrada on December 05, 2009. It was properly titled an \u201cUrgent Petition for Disqualification as Presidential Candidate\u201d. This Petition is premised on the specific provision of Article VII, section 4 of the 1987 Constitution a portion of which stated that: xxx the President shall not be eligible for any re-election .\u201d [102] (Emphasis in the original)\nOn the other hand, summarizing the circumstances of the petition filed by Mary Lou B. Estrada, the COMELEC Second Division stated:\nThe second of the above-entitled cases was filed on December 12, 2009, by Petitioner Mary Lou Estrada alleging that the name of Joseph M. Ejercito Estrada might cause confusion to her prejudice . She filed a \u201cPetition to Disqualify Estrada Ejercito Joseph M. From running as President due to Constitutional Disqualification and Creating Confusion to the Prejudice of Estrada, Mary Lou B\u201d and prayed for the disqualification of the Respondent and to have his Certificate of Candidacy (COC) cancelled. She also made reference to the Respondent being a \u201c Nuisance Candidate \u201d. [103] (Emphasis supplied)\nThat these disqualification cases involved issues and invoked causes of action that are different from those in this case is evident in the recital of issues in the COMELEC Second Division\u2019s January 20, 2010 resolution:\n\nTHE ISSUES IN THE TWO CASES\n(a) Whether or not Respondent Joseph Ejercito Estrada is qualified to be a candidate for the position of President of the Philippines in the forthcoming elections on May 10, 2010, despite the fact that he had previously been elected to, assumed and discharged the duties of, the same position ;\n\n(b) Whether or not, former President Estrada may be considered a nuisance candidate in view of the Constitutional prohibition against any reelection of a former President who has previously elected and had assumed the same position . [104] (Emphasis supplied)\nThis, too, is evident, in the resolution\u2019s introductory paragraphs:\nAt the very core of the controversy involved in these two cases which stands like a stratospheric totem pole is the specific provision under Sec. 4 of Article VII of the 1987 Constitution which states:\n\n. . . .\n\nThis Commission (Second Division) is confronted with the dilemma of deciding a brewing controversy considering the above Constitutional provision which prohibits reelection of \u201cthe President\u201d; that is, whether former President Joseph Ejercito \u201cErap\u201d Estrada may or may not be allowed to run in the coming May 2010 elections for the same position of the President of the Republic of the Philippines ? [105] (Emphasis supplied)\nWhatever pronouncement the COMELEC Second Division made on the matter of Estrada\u2019s conviction for plunder and subsequent pardon was thus a superfluity. Ultimately, it was unnecessary to the resolution of the issues involved in the disqualification cases filed by Atty. Evilio C. Pormento and Mary Lou B. Estrada. It was nothing more than obiter dictum.\n\nAnother disqualification case filed in connection with Estrada\u2019s 2010 bid for the presidency, which, however, Estrada did not cite in his averments was Rev. Elly Velez B. Lao Pamatong, ESQ, petitioner, vs. Joseph Ejercito Estrada and Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo , SPA No. 09-024 (DC). This case was similarly focused on the constitutional prohibition against a President\u2019s re-election and on the allegation that Estrada was a nuisance candidate:\nThe bone of contention of this controversy revolves around the interpretation of the specific provisions of Sec. 4 of Article VII of the 1987 Constitution. . . . [106]\nIts recital of issues reads:\nFrom the foregoing, the Commission (Second Division) hereby rules on the following issues:\n\n[TABLE_CONTENT]\n(a) | Can a former elected President be qualified to become a Presidential Candidate and be elected again to the same position he or she previously occupied?\n | \n(b) | May President Arroyo being a sitting President be allowed to run for any elected position such as a member of the House of Representatives?\n | \n(c) | Are President Arroyo and Former President Estrada nuisance candidates?[107]\n[END_TABLE]\n\n(a) Can a former elected President be qualified to become a Presidential Candidate and be elected again to the same position he or she previously occupied? (b) May President Arroyo being a sitting President be allowed to run for any elected position such as a member of the House of Representatives? (c) Are President Arroyo and Former President Estrada nuisance candidates? [107] That the 2010 disqualification cases were anchored on a constitutional provision relating to the executive branch of government, while the present case is anchored on the provisions of the Local Government Code on the disqualification of candidates for local elective offices, makes evident that the former entailed a different subject matter. While the 2010 disqualification cases relate to Estrada\u2019s bid for the presidency, the present case relates to his bid to become Mayor of the City of Manila.\n\nc. There was no final judgment on the merits arising from the 2010 disqualification cases\n\nNot only do the 2010 disqualification cases involve different issues, causes of action, and subject matters, but these disqualification cases do not even have a final judgment on the merits to speak of.\n\nCabreza, Jr. v. Cabreza [108] explains the concept of a \u201cjudgment on the merits\u201d as follows:\nA judgment may be considered as one rendered on the merits \u201cwhen it determines the rights and liabilities of the parties based on the disclosed facts, irrespective of formal, technical or dilatory objections\u201d; or when the judgment is rendered \u201cafter a determination of which party is right, as distinguished from a judgment rendered upon some preliminary or formal or merely technical point.\u201d [109]\nFollowing the denial of his motion for reconsideration by the COMELEC En Banc, Atty. Evilio C. Pormento sought relief from this court via a petition for certiorari, insisting that Estrada was barred by Article VII, Section 4 of the Constitution from making a second bid for the presidency. This petition was docketed as G.R. No. 191988 and entitled Atty. Evilio C. Pormento, petitioner, vs. Joseph \u201cErap\u201d Ejercito Estrada and Commission on Elections, respondents .\n\nAs noted by this court in its August 31, 2010 resolution in Pormento v. Estrada , [110] the May 10, 2010 elections proceeded without Estrada having been removed from the list of candidates or otherwise being restricted in his candidacy as \u201cunder the Rules of Court, the filing of such petition would not stay the execution of the judgment, final order or resolution of the COMELEC that is sought to be reviewed[; moreover,] petitioner did not even pray for the issuance of a temporary restraining order or writ of preliminary injunction.\u201d [111] Thus, Estrada was able to participate in the May 10, 2010 presidential elections. He, however, only obtained the second highest number of votes and was, thus, not proclaimed winner.\n\nNot having been elected President for a second time, this court ruled that Atty. Evilio C. Pormento\u2019s petition had become moot and academic. Thus, it was denied due course and dismissed:\nPrivate respondent was not elected President the second time he ran. Since the issue on the proper interpretation of the phrase \u201cany reelection\u201d will be premised on a person\u2019s second (whether immediate or not) election as President, there is no case or controversy to be resolved in this case. No live conflict of legal rights exists. There is in this case no definite, concrete, real or substantial controversy that touches on the legal relations of parties having adverse legal interests. No specific relief may conclusively be decreed upon by this Court in this case that will benefit any of the parties herein. As such, one of the essential requisites for the exercise of the power of judicial review, the existence of an actual case or controversy, is sorely lacking in this case.\n\nAs a rule, this Court may only adjudicate actual, ongoing controversies. The Court is not empowered to decide moot questions or abstract propositions, or to declare principles or rules of law which cannot affect the result as to the thing in issue in the case before it. In other words, when a case is moot, it becomes non-justiciable.\n\nAn action is considered \u201cmoot\u201d when it no longer presents a justiciable controversy because the issues involved have become academic or dead or when the matter in dispute has already been resolved and hence, one is not entitled to judicial intervention unless the issue is likely to be raised again between the parties. There is nothing for the court to resolve as the determination thereof has been overtaken by subsequent events.\n\nAssuming an actual case or controversy existed prior to the proclamation of a President who has been duly elected in the May 10, 2010 elections, the same is no longer true today. Following the results of that elections, private respondent was not elected President for the second time. Thus, any discussion of his \u201creelection\u201d will simply be hypothetical and speculative. It will serve no useful or practical purpose.\n\nAccordingly, the petition is denied due course and is hereby DISMISSED.\n\nSO ORDERED. [112] (Citations omitted)\nFrom these, it is plain to see that the substance of Estrada\u2019s qualification (vis-\u00e0-vis Article VII, Section 4 of the 1987 Constitution) was not at all discussed. This court even explicitly stated that were it to make a pronouncement on that matter, this pronouncement would amount to nothing more than a non-binding opinion:\nWhat is the proper interpretation of the following provision of Section 4, Article VII of the Constitution: \u201c[t]he President shall not be eligible for any reelection?\u201d\n\nThe novelty and complexity of the constitutional issue involved in this case present a temptation that magistrates, lawyers, legal scholars and law students alike would find hard to resist. However, prudence dictates that this Court exercise judicial restraint where the issue before it has already been mooted by subsequent events. More importantly, the constitutional requirement of the existence of a \u201ccase\u201d or an \u201cactual controversy\u201d for the proper exercise of the power of judicial review constrains us to refuse the allure of making a grand pronouncement that, in the end, will amount to nothing but a non-binding opinion. [113]\nEstrada, though adjudged by the COMELEC Second Division and COMELEC En Banc to be qualified for a second bid at the presidency, was never conclusively adjudged by this court to be so qualified. The 2010 disqualification cases reached their conclusion not because it was determined, once and for all, that Estrada was not disqualified, but because \u2014 with Estrada\u2019s loss in the elections \u2014 there was no longer a controversy to resolve. There was no \u201cdetermin[ation of] the rights and liabilities of the parties based on the disclosed facts, irrespective of formal, technical or dilatory objections\u201d; [114] neither was there \u201ca determination of which party is right.\u201d [115] While the 2010 disqualification cases may have reached their literal end or terminal point, there was no final judgment on the merits.\n\nVII\n\nEstrada was disqualified from running for Mayor of the City of Manila in the May 13, 2013 elections and remains disqualified from running for any elective post\n\na. Joseph Ejercito Estrada: convicted, disqualified, and pardoned\n\nWe now come to the core of this case, that is, whether Estrada was qualified to run for Mayor of the City of Manila.\n\nIt is not disputed that Estrada was found guilty beyond reasonable doubt and convicted for plunder by the Sandiganbayan. This conviction stands unreversed and unmodified, whether by the Sandiganbayan, on reconsideration, or by this court, on appeal. By this conviction, Estrada was sentenced to suffer the accessory penalty of perpetual absolute disqualification. Per Article 30 of the Revised Penal Code, this accessory penalty produces the effect of, among others, \u201c[t]he deprivation of the right to vote in any election for any popular elective office or to be elected to such office.\u201d [116]\n\nApart from the specific penalty of perpetual absolute disqualification meted on Estrada on account of his conviction, statutory provisions provide for the disqualification from elective public office of individuals who have been convicted for criminal offenses involving moral turpitude [117] and/or entailing a sentence of a defined duration of imprisonment.\n\nSection 12 of the Omnibus Election Code provides for disqualifications for elective offices in general:\nSection 12. Disqualifications. - Any person who has been declared by competent authority insane or incompetent, or has been sentenced by final judgment for subversion, insurrection, rebellion or for any offense for which he has been sentenced to a penalty of more than eighteen months or for a crime involving moral turpitude, shall be disqualified to be a candidate and to hold any office, unless he has been given plenary pardon or granted amnesty .\n\nThis [sic] disqualifications to be a candidate herein provided shall be deemed removed upon the declaration by competent authority that said insanity or incompetence had been removed or after the expiration of a period of five years from his service of sentence, unless within the same period he again becomes disqualified. (Emphasis supplied)\nSection 40 of the Local Government Code provides for disqualifications for local elective offices in particular:\nSECTION 40. Disqualifications. \u2013 The following persons are disqualified from running for any elective local position:\n\n[TABLE_CONTENT]\n(a) | Those sentenced by final judgment for an offense involving moral turpitude or for an offense punishable by one (1) year or more of imprisonment, within two (2) years after serving sentence;\n | \n(b) | Those removed from office as a result of an administrative case;\n | \n(c) | Those convicted by final judgment for violating the oath of allegiance to the Republic;\n | \n(d) | Those with dual citizenship;\n | \n(e) | Fugitives from justice in criminal or non-political cases here or abroad;\n | \n(f) | Permanent residents in a foreign country or those who have acquired the right to reside abroad and continue to avail of the same right after the effectivity of this Code; and\n | \n(g) | The insane or feeble-minded. (Emphasis supplied)\n[END_TABLE]\n\n(a) Those sentenced by final judgment for an offense involving moral turpitude or for an offense punishable by one (1) year or more of imprisonment, within two (2) years after serving sentence; (b) Those removed from office as a result of an administrative case; (c) Those convicted by final judgment for violating the oath of allegiance to the Republic; (d) Those with dual citizenship; (e) Fugitives from justice in criminal or non-political cases here or abroad; (f) Permanent residents in a foreign country or those who have acquired the right to reside abroad and continue to avail of the same right after the effectivity of this Code; and (g) The insane or feeble-minded. (Emphasis supplied) It is with this backdrop of, on the one hand, Estrada\u2019s conviction for plunder (with its concomitant penalty of absolute perpetual disqualification), as well as the cited statutory disqualifications, and, on the other, the pardon granted to Estrada, that this court must rule on whether Estrada was qualified to run for Mayor of Manila in the May 13, 2013 elections.\n\nb. The power to grant clemency: an executive function\n\nThe power to grant pardons, along with other acts of executive clemency, is vested in the President of the Philippines by Article VII, Section 19 of the 1987 Constitution:\nSection 19. Except in cases of impeachment, or as otherwise provided in this Constitution, the President may grant reprieves, commutations, and pardons, and remit fines and forfeitures, after conviction by final judgment.\n\nHe shall also have the power to grant amnesty with the concurrence of a majority of all the Members of the Congress.\nThe recognition that the power to grant clemency is lodged in the executive has been made since the earliest days of the Philippines as a republic. It \u201cis founded on the recognition that human institutions are imperfect and that there are infirmities, deficiencies or flaws in the administration of justice. The power exists as an instrument or means for correcting these infirmities and also for mitigating whatever harshness might be generated by a too strict an application of the law.\u201d [118]\n\nOur constitutional history is a cumulative affirmation of the fundamental conception of the power to pardon as an executive power.\n\nProvisions from Title VIII of the Malolos Constitution of 1899 read:\nArticle 67 - Apart from the powers necessary to execute laws, it is the duty of the President of the Republic to:\nConfer civil and military employment in accordance to the law;\n\nAppoint Secretaries of Government;\n\nDirect diplomatic and commercial relations with other powers;\n\nEnsure the swift and complete administration of justice in the entire territory;\n\nPardon lawbreakers in accordance to the law, subject to the provisions relating to the Secretaries of Government;\n\nPreside over national solemnities, and welcome accredited envoys and representatives of foreign powers.\nArticle 68 - The President of the Republic needs to be authorized by a special law :\nTo transfer, cede or exchange any part of Philippine territory;\n\nTo incorporate any other territory into the Philippines;\n\nTo allow foreign troops in Philippine territory;\n\nTo ratify treaties of offensive and defensive alliance, special commercial treaties, treaties that stipulate subsidies to a foreign power, and any other treaty that compels Filipinos to perform any individual obligation;\n\nIn no case can the confidential articles of a treaty nullify those that are public.\n\nTo grant general amnesties and pardons;\n\nTo mint money. (Emphasis supplied)\nContrasting the provisions of the Malolos Constitution with the present iteration of the pardoning power, it is particularly notable that the power, as provided for in 1899, is deferential to the legislative branch of government. While recognizing the pardoning power as ultimately one for the President to wield, it remained subject to legislative imprimatur.\n\nAided by the lens of history, this is most effectively understood in the context of a \u201cconflict between people, on one hand, who were determined to secure the kind of freedom and economic benefits never enjoyed by them before, and groups, on the other, who wanted to maintain a social status and economic privilege inherited from way back or recently acquired by the displacement of elements formerly controlling the destiny of the colony.\u201d [119] The latter \u2014 ilustrados \u2014 were the driving force behind the adoption of a constitution, and they endeavored \u201cto make the legislature the most powerful unit in the government.\u201d [120]\n\nThe adoption of organic acts under the auspices of American rule enabled the assimilation of some American constitutional principles. Not least of these is the grant to the executive of the power to pardon. The Constitution of the United States of America includes the grant of the pardoning power in the recital of the President\u2019s powers:\nArticle II, Section 2.\n\nThe President shall be Commander in Chief of the Army and Navy of the United States, and of the Militia of the several States, when called into the actual Service of the United States; he may require the Opinion, in writing, of the principal Officer in each of the executive Departments, upon any Subject relating to the Duties of their respective Offices, and he shall have Power to grant Reprieves and Pardons for Offences against the United States, except in Cases of Impeachment.\n\n. . . .\nThus, the Jones Law of 1916 provides:\nSection 21.-The Governor-General\n\n[TABLE_CONTENT]\n(b) | Powers and duties.-. . . .He is hereby vested with the exclusive power to grant pardons and reprieves and remit fines and forfeitures, and may veto any legislation enacted as herein provided.. . .\n[END_TABLE]\n\n(b) Powers and duties.-. . . . He is hereby vested with the exclusive power to grant pardons and reprieves and remit fines and forfeitures, and may veto any legislation enacted as herein provided. . . . As against the Malolos Constitution, the Jones Law makes no reference to the need for legislative consent, whether a priori or a posteriori , for the exercise of the pardoning power. Equally notable, the pardoning power is mentioned in the same breath ( i.e. , the same sentence) as the veto power \u2014 a power that delineates the relation of the executive branch with the legislative branch.\n\nWith the onset of the Commonwealth and en route to independence, the 1935 Constitution affirmed that the power to pardon is executive in nature. Article VII, Section 11(6) of the 1935 Constitution reads:\nSection 11. . . .\n\n(6) The President shall have the power to grant reprieves, commutations, and pardons, and remit fines and forfeitures, after conviction, for all offenses, except in cases of impeachment, upon such conditions and with such restrictions and limitations as he may deem proper to impose. He shall have the power to grant amnesty with the concurrence of the National Assembly.\nA recollection of the proceedings of the Constitutional Convention reveals attempts \u201cto limit the absolute character of the pardoning power of the Executive:\u201d [121]\nIt was also generally held that, as it was under the Jones Law and in other countries, the pardoning power should be vested in the Executive, although there was a difference of opinion with respect to the authority to exercise the power to grant amnesty. There were many proposals, however, intended to limit the absolute character of the pardoning power of the Executive. Of them were the proposal in the report of the committee on executive power and in the first draft of the Constitution to the effect that pardon should be granted to a person only after his conviction; the Galang amendment embodying a proposal in the report of the committee on executive power to the effect that the Chief Executive could grant pardon to a person only after the latter had served part of the sentence imposed upon him, except in cases where the convicting court should recommend executive clemency, when the same could be exercised even prior to the service of the sentence; and the Sanvictores amendment providing that no pardon should, without the recommendation of the Supreme Court, be granted until the prisoner should have served at least one-half of the minimum sentence imposed.\n\n. . . .\n\nThe Galang amendment and the Sanvictores amendment would go further by requiring that no person, even if already convicted, should be pardoned unless he had served partially his sentence. The Galang amendment would permit executive clemency even before the commencement of the service of the sentence, upon the recommendation of the convicting court; and the Sanvictores amendment, upon the recommendation of the Supreme Court. . . . [122]\nAs will be gleaned from the final text of the 1935 Constitution, the Galang and Sanvictores amendments were both defeated. Thus was affirmed the executive nature of the power to pardon.\n\nThe 1943 Constitution, adopted in the interlude of the Second World War and the Japanese occupation, echoed the language of the 1935 Constitution on the executive nature of the pardoning power. The text of Article II, Section 13 of the 1943 Constitution is substantially similar with its counterpart in the 1935 Constitution except for the non-mention of impeachment as beyond the coverage of pardoning power:\nSection 13. The President shall have the power to grant reprieves, commutations and pardons, and remit fines and forfeitures, after conviction, for all offenses, upon such conditions and with such restrictions and limitations as he may deem proper to impose. He shall have the power to grant amnesty with the concurrence of the National Assembly.\nLike the Jones Law, but unlike the 1935 and 1943 Constitutions, the 1973 Constitution (as amended) dispensed with the requirement of prior conviction. The 1973 Constitution, adopted during the rule of President Ferdinand E. Marcos, is characteristic of a strong executive. Article VII, Section 11 of the 1973 Constitution provides:\nSection 11. The President may, except in cases of impeachment, grant reprieves, commutations and pardons, remit fines and forfeitures and, with the concurrence of the Batasang Pambansa, grant amnesty.\nFrom the grant of the power made by Section 21(b) of the Jones Law of 1916 to the present, the 1987 Constitution, the shifts in the grant to the executive of the power to extend clemency has mainly been in the matter of requiring or dispensing with conviction as a condition precedent for the exercise of executive clemency.\n\nThe present, the 1987 Constitution, requires prior conviction. Nevertheless, it retains the fundamental regard for the pardoning power as executive in nature. Jurisprudence dating to 1991 [123] noted how the 1986 Constitutional Commission rejected a proposal to render the coverage of the pardoning power susceptible to legislative interference, particularly in matters relating to graft and corruption. Likewise, jurisprudence as recent as 2007 [124] clarified that a court cannot pre-empt the grant of executive clemency.\n\nIn addition to restoring the requirement of prior conviction, the 1987 Constitution now includes the phrase \u201cas otherwise provided in this Constitution.\u201d\n\nThe 1987 Constitution, in Article VII, Section 19, enumerates the acts or means through which the President may extend clemency: (1) reprieve, or \u201cthe deferment of the implementation of the sentence for an interval of time;\u201d [125] (2) commutation, which \u201crefers to the reduction of the duration of a prison sentence of a prisoner;\u201d [126] (3) remission of fines and forfeitures; (4) pardon; and (5) amnesty.\n\n\u201c[P]ardon is of British origin, conceived to temper the gravity of the King's wrath.\u201d [127] It is \"an act of grace , proceeding from the power entrusted with the execution of the laws, which exempts the individual, on whom it is bestowed, from the punishment the law inflicts for a crime he has committed. It is the private , though official act of the executive magistrate, delivered to the individual for whose benefit it is intended, and not communicated officially to the Court. . . . A pardon is a deed , to the validity of which delivery is essential, and delivery is not complete without acceptance.\" [128] (Emphasis supplied)\n\nPardon and amnesty have been distinguished as follows:\nPardon is granted by the Chief Executive and as such it is a private act which must be pleaded and proved by the person pardoned, because the courts take no notice thereof; while amnesty by Proclamation of the Chief Executive with the concurrence of Congress, and it is a public act of which the courts should take judicial notice. Pardon is granted to one after conviction; while amnesty is granted to classes of persons or communities who may be guilty of political offenses, generally before or after the institution of the criminal prosecution and sometimes after conviction. Pardon looks forward and relieves the offender form the consequences of an offense of which he has been convicted, that is, it abolishes or forgives the punishment, and for that reason it does \"not work the restoration of the rights to hold public office, or the right of suffrage, unless such rights be expressly restored by the terms of the pardon,\" and it \"in no case exempts the culprit from the payment of the civil indemnity imposed upon him by the sentence\". While amnesty looks backward and abolishes and puts into oblivion the offense with which he is charged that the person released by amnesty stands before the law precisely as though he had committed no offense. [129] (Emphasis supplied, citations omitted)\nc. Pardon and its effects: forgiveness but not forgetfulness\n\nEstrada argues that pardon is characterized by what he refers to as the \u201cforgive-and-forget rule.\u201d [130] He cites several decisions rendered in the United States [131] (chiefly, the 1866, post-Civil War decision in Ex parte Garland ) and insists that \u201cpardon not merely releases the offender from the punishment . . . but that it obliterates in legal contemplation the offense itself\u201d [132] and that it \u201cforever closes the eyes of the court.\u201d [133] Citing this court\u2019s decisions in Cristobal v. Labrador [134] and in Pelobello v. Palatino , [135] Estrada asserts that pardon \u201cblots out of existence the guilt, so that in the eye of the law the offender is as innocent as if he had never committed the offence . . . it makes him, as it were, a new man, and gives him new credit and capacity.\u201d [136]\n\nEstrada is in grave error for insisting on what he has dubbed as the \u201cforgive-and-forget rule.\u201d\n\nIn Monsanto v. Factoran , [137] this court repudiated the pronouncements made by Cristobal and Pelobello , as well as reliance on Garland , on the nature and effects of pardon:\nIn Pelobello v. Palatino , we find a reiteration of the stand consistently adopted by the courts on the various consequences of pardon: \"x x x we adopt the broad view expressed in Cristobal v. Labrador , G.R. No. 47941, December 7, 1940, that subject to the limitations imposed by the Constitution, the pardoning power cannot be restricted or controlled by legislative action; that an absolute pardon not only blots out the crime committed but removes all disabilities resulting from the conviction. x x x (W)e are of the opinion that the better view in the light of the constitutional grant in this jurisdiction is not to unnecessarily restrict or impair the power of the Chief Executive who, after an inquiry into the environmental facts, should be at liberty to atone the rigidity of the law to the extent of relieving completely the party x x x concerned from the accessory and resultant disabilities of criminal conviction.\"\n\nThe Pelobello v. Palatino and Cristobal v. Labrador cases, and several others show the unmistakable application of the doctrinal case of Ex Parte Garland , whose sweeping generalizations to this day continue to hold sway in our jurisprudence despite the fact that much of its relevance has been downplayed by later American decisions.\n\nConsider the following broad statements:\n\u201cA pardon reaches both the punishment prescribed for the offense and the guilt of the offendor; and when the pardon is full, it releases the punishment and blots out of existence the guilt, so that in the eye of the law the offender is as innocent as if he had never committed the offense. If granted before conviction, it prevents any of the penalties and disabilities, consequent upon conviction, from attaching; if granted after conviction, it removes the penalties and disabilities and restores him to all his civil rights; it makes him, as it were, a new man, and gives him a new credit and capacity.\"\nSuch generalities have not been universally accepted, recognized or approved. The modern trend of authorities now rejects the unduly broad language of the Garland case (reputed to be perhaps the most extreme statement which has been made on the effects of a pardon). To our mind, this [i.e., the rejection of Garland] is the more realistic approach . While a pardon has generally been regarded as blotting out the existence of guilt so that in the eye of the law the offender is as innocent as though he never committed the offense, it does not operate for all purposes. The very essence of a pardon is forgiveness or remission of guilt. Pardon implies guilt. It does not erase the fact of the commission of the crime and the conviction thereof. It does not wash out the moral stain. It involves forgiveness and not forgetfulness .\n\nThe better considered cases regard full pardon (at least one not based on the offender's innocence) as relieving the party from all the punitive consequences of his criminal act, including the disqualifications or disabilities based on the finding of guilt. But it relieves him from nothing more. \u201c To say, however, that the offender is a \u2018new man\u2019, and \u2018as innocent as if he had never committed the offense\u2019; is to ignore the difference between the crime and the criminal . A person adjudged guilty of an offense is a convicted criminal, though pardoned; he may be deserving of punishment, though left unpunished ; and the law may regard him as more dangerous to society than one never found guilty of crime, though it places no restraints upon him following his conviction.\u201d [138] (Emphasis and underscoring supplied, citations omitted)\nEstrada has made much of how Monsanto centered on the issue of the need for a new appointment of a pardoned officer seeking to be reinstated to her former position. He posits that Monsanto could not be controlling in this case, as what is at issue here is qualification for elective public office. [139]\n\nThis is but a vain attempt to split hairs. It is clear from the previously quoted discussion in Monsanto that there was an unequivocal consideration by this court of the nature and effects of pardon. This discussion laid the premises for the ultimate resolution of the dispute and was indispensable to the conclusions this court reached. As against Monsanto , Estrada would have this court rely on a decision, which was rendered nearly a century and a half ago by a court outside of this jurisdiction ( i.e. , Ex parte Garland ), and which, this court has observed to be against the grain of contemporary authorities. In addition, Estrada would have us rely on jurisprudence which themselves depend on the same archaic and foreign decision. To do, as Estrada suggests, would be to indulge an absurdity. Estrada effectively invites this court to irrationality and to arrive at a conclusion resting on premises that have been roundly renounced.\n\nIn any case, from the preceding discussions, two points are worthy of particular emphasis:\nPardon is a private , though official, act of the executive. Proceeding from the power to execute laws, it merely evinces the executive\u2019s choice to decline from enforcing punishment so as to mollify penal misery.\n\nPardon does not erase the moral stain and the fact of conviction. It retains the law\u2019s regard for a convict \u201cas more dangerous to society than one never found guilty of a crime\u201d; [140] the convict remains \u201cdeserving of punishment\u201d though left unpunished. [141]\nIt is with the illumination of this fundamental notion of pardon as a \u2018 private act that does not erase the moral stain and the fact of conviction \u2019 that this court must proceed to make a determination of Estrada\u2019s qualification.\n\nVIII\n\nThe exercise of pardon:\nlimitations and prescriptions\n\na. Articles 36 and 41 of the Revised Penal Code do not abridge or diminish the pardoning power of the President\n\nArticle VII, Section 19 of the 1987 Constitution provides two (2) limitations on the President\u2019s exercise of the power to pardon: first, it can only be given after final conviction; and, second, it cannot be exercised \u201cin cases of impeachment, or as otherwise provided in this Constitution.\u201d Elsewhere in the Constitution, Article IX, C, Section 5 provides that: \u201cNo pardon, amnesty, parole, or suspension of sentence for violation of election laws, rules, and regulations shall be granted by the President without the favorable recommendation of the Commission [on Elections].\u201d\n\nOutside of the Constitution, the Revised Penal Code contains provisions relating to pardon.\n\nArticle 36 of the Revised Penal Code provides that: \u201cA pardon shall in no case exempt the culprit from the payment of the civil indemnity imposed upon him.\u201d\n\nThe same Article 36 prescribes that for pardon to effect the restoration of the rights of suffrage and to hold public office , \u201csuch rights [must] be expressly restored by the terms of the pardon.\u201d\n\nAlso on suffrage and/or the rights to vote for and be elected to public office, Articles 40 to 43 of the Revised Penal Code provide that the penalties of perpetual absolute disqualification, temporary absolute disqualification, perpetual special disqualification, and perpetual special disqualification on suffrage, which attach as accessory penalties to death, reclusion perpetua, reclusion temporal, prisi\u00f3n mayor and prisi\u00f3n correccional, as the case may be, shall still be suffered by the offender even though pardoned as to the principal penalty, \u201cunless . . . expressly remitted in the pardon\u201d:\nARTICLE 40. Death \u2014 Its Accessory Penalties. \u2014 The death penalty, when it is not executed by reason of commutation or pardon shall carry with it that of perpetual absolute disqualification and that of civil interdiction during thirty years following the date of sentence, unless such accessory penalties have been expressly remitted in the pardon .\n\nARTICLE 41. Reclusi\u00f3n Perpetua and Reclusi\u00f3n Temporal \u2014 Their accessory penalties. \u2014 The penalties of reclusi\u00f3n perpetua and reclusi\u00f3n temporal shall carry with them that of civil interdiction for life or during the period of the sentence as the case may be, and that of perpetual absolute disqualification which the offender shall suffer even though pardoned as to the principal penalty, unless the same shall have been expressly remitted in the pardon .\n\nARTICLE 42. Prisi\u00f3n Mayor \u2014 Its Accessory Penalties. \u2014 The penalty of prisi\u00f3n mayor shall carry with it that of temporary absolute disqualification and that of perpetual special disqualification from the right of suffrage which the offender shall suffer although pardoned as to the principal penalty, unless the same shall have been expressly remitted in the pardon .\n\nARTICLE 43. Prisi\u00f3n Correccional \u2014 Its Accessory Penalties. \u2014 The penalty of prisi\u00f3n correccional shall carry with it that of suspension from public office, from the right to follow a profession or calling, and that of perpetual special disqualification from the right of suffrage, if the duration of said imprisonment shall exceed eighteen months. The offender shall suffer the disqualification provided in this article although pardoned as to the principal penalty, unless the same shall have been expressly remitted in the pardon . (Emphasis supplied)\nCiting the same cases of Cristobal, Pelobello , and Garland , Estrada argues that Articles 36 and 41 of the Revised Penal Code violate the Constitution in requiring that the restoration of the rights of suffrage or to otherwise vote for and be elected to public office must be made expressly. Specifically, he claims that these provisions \u201cabridge or diminish the pardoning power of the President.\u201d [142]\n\nThis court has previously acknowledged, in Llamas v. Orbos , [143] that the 1986 Constitutional Commission rejected a proposal to include in Article VII, Section 19, a statement to the effect that \"the power to grant executive clemency for violation of corrupt practices laws may be limited by legislation.\" Thus, this court concluded that \u201cthe President's executive clemency powers may not be limited in terms of coverage , except as already provided in the Constitution\u201d:\nDuring the deliberations of the Constitutional Commission, a subject of deliberations was the proposed amendment to Art. VII, Sec. 19 which reads as follows: \"However, the power to grant executive clemency for violation of corrupt practices laws may be limited by legislation.\" The Constitutional Commission, however, voted to remove the amendment, since it was in derogation of the powers of the President. As Mr. Natividad stated:\n\u201cI am also against this provision which will again chip more powers from the President. In case of other criminals convicted in our society we extend probation to them while in this case, they have already been convicted and we offer mercy. The only way we can offer mercy to them is through this executive clemency extended to them by the President. If we still close this avenue to them, they would be prejudiced even worse than the murderers and the more vicious killers in our society. . . .\u201d\nThe proposal was primarily intended to prevent the President from protecting his cronies. Manifestly, however, the Commission preferred to trust in the discretion of Presidents and refrained from putting additional limitations on his clemency powers. (II RECORD of the Constitutional Commission, 392, 418-419, 524-525)\n\nIt is evident from the intent of the Constitutional Commission, therefore, that the President's executive clemency powers may not be limited in terms of coverage , except as already provided in the Constitution , that is, \"no pardon, amnesty, parole, or suspension of sentence for violation of election laws, rules and regulations shall be granted by the President without the favorable recommendation of the COMELEC\" (Article IX, C, Section 5, Constitution). If those already adjudged guilty criminally in court may be pardoned, those adjudged guilty administratively should likewise be extended the same benefit. [144]\nNot only has the coverage of executive clemency been recognized to be beyond the reach of legislative action, this court has also noted that the matter of whether the President should actually choose to extend executive clemency to a convict cannot be preempted by judicial action. Thus, the determination of whether a convict shall be extended clemency is a decision that is solely for the President to make:\nThis Court cannot review, much less preempt, the exercise of executive clemency under the pretext of preventing the accused from evading the penalty of reclusion perpetua or from trifling with our judicial system. Clemency is not a function of the judiciary; it is an executive function. . . . [145]\nThe 1987 Constitution\u2019s recital of the instances when pardon may or may not be exercised and this court\u2019s prior recognition of clemency as an executive function notwithstanding, Articles 36 and 41 of the Revised Penal Code could not be considered as abridging or diminishing the President\u2019s right to extend clemency.\n\nTo \u201cabridge\u201d or to \u201cdiminish\u201d is to shorten, reduce, or lessen. [146] Further, \u201ccoverage\u201d pertains to scope, [147] it refers to \u201c[t]he extent to which something deals with or applies to something else.\u201d [148]\n\nArticles 36 and 41 do not reduce the coverage of the President\u2019s pardoning power . At no point do they say that the President may not grant pardon. They do not recite instances or areas in which the President\u2019s power to pardon is rendered non-existent, or in which the President is otherwise incapable of granting pardon. Articles 36 and 41 notwithstanding, the only instances in which the President may not extend pardon remain to be: (1) impeachment cases; (2) cases that have not yet resulted in a final conviction; and (3) cases involving violations of election laws, rules, and regulations in which there was no favorable recommendation coming from the COMELEC. Stated otherwise, the President remains capacitated to grant a pardon that works to restore the rights of suffrage and/or to hold public office, or to otherwise remit the penalty of perpetual absolute disqualification.\n\nArticles 36 and 41 refer only to requirements of convention or form. They only provide a procedural prescription. They are not concerned with areas where or the instances when the President may grant pardon; they are only concerned with how he or she is to exercise such power so that no other governmental instrumentality needs to intervene to give it full effect.\n\nAll that Articles 36 and 41 do is prescribe that, if the President wishes to include in the pardon the restoration of the rights of suffrage and to hold public office, or the remission of the accessory penalty of perpetual absolute disqualification, he or she should do so expressly. Articles 36 and 41 only ask that the President state his or her intentions clearly, directly, firmly, precisely, and unmistakably. To belabor the point, the President retains the power to make such restoration or remission, subject to a prescription on the manner by which he or she is to state it.\n\nThis interpretation is consistent with the clear constitutional intention to grant exclusive prerogative to the President to decide when to exercise such power. As in this case, any ambiguity invites judicial intervention.\n\nAlso, it is a basic precept that \u201cpublic office is a public trust.\u201d [149] In contrast, pardon is a \u201cprivate, though official act of the executive magistrate, delivered to the individual for whose benefit it is intended.\u201d [150] Given the contrasting natures of, on the one hand, elective office as a public trust, and, on the other, pardon as a private act, it \u201cwould not be asking too much\u201d [151] of the President to be unequivocal with his or her intentions on restoring a convict\u2019s right not just to vote, but more so, to be voted for elective public office.\n\nDoing so serves not only a practical purpose but, more importantly, the greater public interest in not leaving to inference the qualification of a person who is regarded \u201cas more dangerous to society\u201d [152] but stands to gain from the reposition of public trust. [153] It addresses the \u201cpresumptive rule that one who is rendered infamous by conviction of a felony, or other base offense indicative of moral turpitude, is unfit to hold public office, as the same partakes of a privilege which the State grants only to such classes of persons which are most likely to exercise it for the common good .\u201d [154]\n\nPronouncing in express and unmistakable language the restoration of the right to vote and be voted, therefore, complements the private act of pardoning such that it enables the inclusion of public effects in the private act. It desegregates the public consequence of enabling the convict with the opportunity to lead the community by being the occupant of a public office.\n\nRecall that the manner by which the 1987 Constitution phrases its investiture on the President of the pardoning power now includes the phrase \u201cas otherwise provided in this Constitution.\u201d This phrase affirms the imperative of reading and interpreting the Constitution in its entirety, not taking a provision in isolation. The pardoning power of the President must, thus, not be divorced from the Constitution\u2019s injunction that \u201c[p]ublic office is a public trust.\u201d [155] Read in harmony with this injunction, Articles 36 and 41 of the Revised Penal Code impress upon the President the significance of departing from the purely private consequences of pardon should he or she stray into the public affair of restoring a convict\u2019s rights of suffrage and/or to hold public office.\n\nParenthetically, the Constitution also grants this court jurisdiction to determine \u201cwhether or not there has been a grave abuse of discretion amounting to . . . excess of jurisdiction on the part of any branch or instrumentality of the Government.\u201d [156] This means that no grant of constitutional power is immune from review if it is done arbitrarily or without reason, capriciously, or on the basis of whim. However, this court\u2019s power of review in the present case is not raised by any party and, thus, not an issue that this court must decide.\n\n(b) Clarifying Monsanto\n\nMonsanto , in the course of repudiating Cristobal, Pelobello , and Garland , declared that \u201c[t]he better considered cases regard full pardon . . . as relieving the party from all the punitive consequences of his criminal act, including the disqualifications or disabilities based on the finding of guilt.\u201d [157]\n\nThis \u201cinclusion\u201d should not be taken as authority for concluding that the grant of pardon ipso facto remits the accessory disqualifications or disabilities imposed on a convict regardless of whether the remission was explicitly stated.\n\nFor one, this \u201cinclusion\u201d was not a categorical articulation by this court of a prevailing rule. It was a statement made only in the course of a comparative survey of cases during which the court manifested a preference for \u201cauthorities [that reject] the unduly broad language of the Garland case.\u201d [158]\n\nSecond, the footnote to this statement indicates that it relied on a case decided by a United States court: Comm. of Met. Dist. Com. v. Director of Civil Service . [159] Thus, it was never meant as a summation of the controlling principles in this jurisdiction. It did not account for Articles 36 and 41 of the Revised Penal Code.\n\nLastly, even if it were to be granted that this statement articulated a rule, this statement, made in 1989, must be deemed to have been abandoned, in light of this court\u2019s more recent pronouncements \u2014 in 1997, in People v. Casido , [160] and in 2000, in People v. Patriarca [161] \u2014 which cited with approval this court\u2019s statement in Barrioquinto v. Fernandez [162] that:\n[p]ardon looks forward and relieves the offender from the consequences of an offense of which he has been convicted, that is, it abolishes or forgives the punishment, and for that reason it does \u2018not work the restoration of the rights to hold public office, or the right of suffrage, unless such rights be expressly restored by the terms of the pardon,\u2019 and it \u2018in no case exempts the culprit from the payment of the civil indemnity imposed upon him by the sentence\u2019. [163] (Emphasis supplied)\nSo, too, this statement indicating \u201cinclusion\u201d must be deemed superseded by this court\u2019s 2013 pronouncement in Romeo Jalosjos v. COMELEC [164] which recognizes that \u201cone who is previously convicted of a crime punishable by reclusion perpetua or reclusion temporal continues to suffer the accessory penalty of perpetual absolute disqualification even though pardoned as to the principal penalty, unless the said accessory penalty shall have been expressly remitted in the pardon .\u201d [165]\n\nIX\n\nNo remission of the penalty of perpetual absolute disqualification and restoration of the rights to vote and be voted for elective public office in Estrada\u2019s pardon\n\nHaving established that the challenge to the validity of Articles 36 and 41 of the Revised Penal Code must fail, we turn to the pivotal issue of whether, in light of these statutory provisions, the pardon granted to Estrada effectively restored his rights to vote and be voted for elective public office, or otherwise remitted his perpetual absolute disqualification.\n\nIt did not.\n\n(a) No express remission and/or restoration; reliance on inference is improper\n\nThe dispositive portion of the pardon extended by former President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo to Estrada reads:\nIN VIEW HEREOF and pursuant to the authority conferred upon me by the Constitution, I hereby grant executive clemency to JOSEPH EJERCITO ESTRADA, convicted by the Sandiganbayan of Plunder and imposed a penalty of Reclusion Perpetua. He is hereby restored to his civil and political rights.\n\nThe forfeitures imposed by the Sandiganbayan remain in force and in full, including all writs and processes issued by the Sandiganbayan in pursuance hereof, except for the bank account(s) he owned before his tenure as President.\n\nUpon acceptance of this pardon by JOSEPH EJERCITO ESTRADA, this pardon shall take effect. [166]\nFrom the plain text of this disposition, it can be readily seen that there is no categorical statement actually saying that Estrada\u2019s rights to vote and be voted for elective public office are restored, or that the penalty of perpetual absolute disqualification is remitted.\n\nThe disposition contains three (3) clauses that delimit the effects of the pardon:\nThe general grant of executive clemency to Estrada ( i.e. , \u201cI hereby grant executive clemency to JOSEPH EJERCITO ESTRADA\u201d);\n\nThe restoration of Estrada\u2019s civil and political rights ( i.e. , \u201cHe is hereby restored to his civil and political rights\u201d); and\n\nThe continuing validity of the forfeitures imposed by the Sandiganbayan.\nAs a cure for the lack of a categorical statement restoring his rights to vote and be voted for elective public office, or otherwise remitting the penalty of perpetual absolute disqualification, Estrada argues that the rights to vote and be voted for elective public office are political rights; hence, \u201cthe restoration of Estrada\u2019s right to seek public office is deemed subsumed when the pardon extended by GMA expressly restored the civil and political rights of the Public (sic) Respondent.\u201d [167] He asserts that \u201c[s]uch statement is already a substantial if not full compliance with the requirements of Article 36 of the Revised Penal Code.\u201d [168]\n\nEstrada\u2019s use of tentative and indefinite language \u2014 such as \u201cdeemed subsumed\u201d and \u201csubstantial compliance\u201d \u2014 reveals his own acknowledgement that the restoration and/or remission, if any, in the pardon are not as unequivocal or as absolutely clear as they could otherwise have been had the pardon simply stated, for instance, that \u201cthe penalty of perpetual absolute disqualification is hereby removed.\u201d\n\nEstrada is noticeably compelled to resort to syllogism in order to arrive at the deductive conclusion that he is qualified to run. He rests his position on an inference.\n\nThis reliance on inference is precisely what the requirement of expressly stating the restoration or remission seeks to avoid. To be \u201cexpress\u201d is to state \u201cdirectly, firmly, and explicitly.\u201d [169] It is synonymous with being precise. [170] On the contrary, to \u201cinfer\u201d is to rely on what is implied; it is to \u201csurmise.\u201d [171] Inference is exactly what relying on an express pronouncement does not entail.\n\n(b) Even the inference that Estrada proffers is laden with fallacies\n\nIn any case, even if Estrada\u2019s inferences and reliance on the characterization of the rights to vote and be voted for elective public office as political rights is to be indulged, it does not follow that these specific rights have been restored by the pardon\u2019s generic restoration of civil and political rights.\n\nThe concept of \u201ccivil and political rights\u201d both as its own collectivity and in contrast with other classes of human rights emerged in the aftermath of the Second World War. Its conceptual development is more effectively understood in the context of the emergence of the contemporary human rights regime and the efforts at enabling the then nascent United Nations to \u201cassum[e] the role of guarantor of human rights on a universal scale\u201d [172] consistent with the perceived need that \u201cthe individual human being be placed under the protection of the international community.\u201d [173]\n\nAs Professor Christian Tomuschat discussed in an introductory note to the International Convention on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), the Second World War revealed that \u201cnational governments could gravely fail in their duty to ensure the life and the liberty of their citizens.\u201d [174] Worse, some of these national governments have themselves \u201cbecome murderous institutions.\u201d [175] It was, therefore, evident \u201cthat protective mechanisms at the domestic level alone did not provide sufficiently stable safeguards.\u201d [176]\n\nThe historical milieu of the efforts taken to enable the United Nations to assume the previously mentioned \u201crole of guarantor of human rights on a universal scale\u201d [177] reveals how \u201ccivil and political rights\u201d as a concept of distinct rights \u2014 embodied in its own instrument \u2014 came to be:\nAt the San Francisco Conference in 1945, some Latin American countries requested that a full code of human rights be included in the Charter of the United Nations itself. Since such an initiative required careful preparation, their motions could not be successful at that stage. Nonetheless, human rights were embraced as a matter of principle. The Charter contains references to human rights in the Preamble, among the purposes of the Organization (Article 1) and in several other provisions (Articles 13, 55, 62 and 68). Immediately after the actual setting up of the institutional machinery provided for by the Charter, the new Commission on Human Rights began its work for the creation of an International Bill of Rights. In a first step, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights was drafted, which the General Assembly adopted on 10 December 1948.\n\nIn order to make human rights an instrument effectively shaping the lives of individuals and nations, more than just a political proclamation was needed. Hence, from the very outset there was general agreement to the effect that the substance of the Universal Declaration should be translated into the hard legal form of an international treaty. The General Assembly reaffirmed the necessity of complementing, as had already been done in the Universal Declaration, traditional civil and political rights with economic, social and cultural rights, since both classes of rights were \u201cinterconnected and interdependent\u201d (see section E of resolution 421 (V) of 4 December 1950). The only question was whether, following the concept of unity of all human rights, the new conventional rights should be encompassed in one international instrument or whether, on account of their different specificities, they should be arranged according to those specificities. Western nations in particular claimed that the implementation process could not be identical, economic and social rights partaking more of the nature of goals to be attained whereas civil and political rights had to be respected strictly and without any reservations. It is this latter view that eventually prevailed. By resolution 543 (VI) of 4 February 1952, the General Assembly directed the Commission on Human Rights to prepare, instead of just one Covenant, two draft treaties; a Covenant setting forth civil and political rights and a parallel Covenant providing for economic, social and cultural rights. The Commission completed its work in 1954. Yet it took many years before eventually the political climate was ripe for the adoption of these two ambitious texts. While both the Western and the Socialist States were still not fully convinced of their usefulness, it was eventually pressure brought to bear upon them from Third World countries which prompted them to approve the outcome of the protracted negotiating process. Accordingly, on 16 December 1966, the two Covenants were adopted by the General Assembly by consensus, without any abstentions (resolution 2200 (XXI)). Since that time, the two comprehensive human rights instruments of the United Nations have sailed on different courses. [178]\nProfessor Tomuschat further summarizes the provisions of the ICCPR, its manner of recital of civil and political rights, and the common thread binding the rights recited in it:\nThe ICCPR comprises all of the traditional human rights as they are known from historic documents such as the First Ten Amendments to the Constitution of the United States (1789/1791) and the French D\u00e9claration des droits de l\u2019homme et du citoyen (1789). However, in perfect harmony with its sister instrument, Part I starts out with the right of self-determination which is considered to be the foundational stone of all human rights (article 1). Part II (articles 2 to 5) contains a number of general principles that apply across the board, among them in particular the prohibition on discrimination. Part III enunciates an extended list of rights, the first of which being the right to life (article 6). Article 7 establishes a ban on torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, and article 8 declares slavery and forced or compulsory labour unlawful. Well-balanced guarantees of habeas corpus are set forth in article 9, and article 10 establishes the complementary proviso that all persons deprived of their liberty shall be treated with humanity.\n\nFreedom of movement, including the freedom to leave any country, has found its regulation in article 12. Aliens, who do not enjoy a stable right of sojourn, must as a minimum be granted due process in case their expulsion is envisaged (article 13). Fair trial, the scope ratione materiae of which is confined to criminal prosecution and to civil suits at law, has its seat in articles 14 and 15. Privacy, the family, the home or the correspondence of a person are placed under the protection of article 17, and the social activities of human beings enjoy the safeguards of article 18 (freedom of thought, conscience and religion), article 19 (freedom of expression), article 21 (freedom of assembly), and article 22 (freedom of association). Going beyond the classic dimension of protection against interference by State authorities, articles 23 and 24 proclaim that the family and the child are entitled to protection by society and the State.\n\nArticle 25 establishes the right for everyone to take part in the running of the public affairs of his/her country. With this provision, the ICCPR makes clear that State authorities require some sort of democratic legitimacy. Finally, article 27 recognizes an individual right of members of ethnic, religious or linguistic minorities to engage in the cultural activities characteristic of such minorities. No political rights are provided for. Minorities as such have not been endowed with any rights of political autonomy. [179]\nConsistent with this concept of civil and political rights as a collectivity of \u201ctraditional human rights as they are known from historic documents\u201d [180] is Karal Vasak\u2019s conception [181] of civil and political rights as \u201cfirst-generation human rights.\u201d This is in contrast with economic, social and cultural rights as \u201csecond-generation human rights\u201d and collective-developmental rights as \u201cthird-generation human rights.\u201d Vasak\u2019s conception of three generations of human rights is a deliberate effort to parallel the French Revolution ideals of liberty, equality, and fraternity, with each generation ordinally reflecting the three ideals. Thus, \u201c[f]irst-generation, \u2018civil-political\u2019 rights deal with liberty and participation in political life.\u201d [182]\n\nIn our jurisprudence, Simon, Jr. v. Commission on Human Rights [183] discussed the concept of human rights as \u201cso generic a term that any attempt to define it . . . could at best be described as inconclusive.\u201d [184] Further, it attempted to define civil rights and political rights as follows:\nThe term \u201ccivil rights,\u201d has been defined as referring \u2013\n\"(to) those (rights) that belong to every citizen of the state or country, or, in a wider sense, to all its inhabitants, and are not connected with the organization or administration of government. They include the rights of property, marriage, equal protection of the laws, freedom of contract, etc. Or, as otherwise defined civil rights are rights appertaining to a person by virtue of his citizenship in a state or community. Such term may also refer, in its general sense, to rights capable of being enforced or redressed in a civil action.\"\nAlso quite often mentioned are the guarantees against involuntary servitude, religious persecution, unreasonable searches and seizures, and imprisonment for debt.\n\nPolitical rights, on the other hand, are said to refer to the right to participate, directly or indirectly, in the establishment or administration of government, the right of suffrage, the right to hold public office, the right of petition and, in general, the rights appurtenant to citizenship vis-a-vis the management of government. [185] (Citations omitted)\nThe recurring refrain of these discussions \u2014 historical, academic and jurisprudential \u2014 is the understanding that \u201ccivil and political rights\u201d is a collectivity. It is a figurative basket of \u201crights directly possessed by individuals [that are correlatively] positive duties upon the government to respect and fulfil them.\u201d [186] Understood in this context, it is clear that the rights of suffrage and to hold public (elective) office, are but two of a manifold category of rights \u201cdeal[ing] with liberty and participation in political life\u201d [187] and encompassing the entire spectrum of all such \u201crights appurtenant to citizenship vis-\u00e0-vis the management of government.\u201d [188]\n\nIn light of the circumstances of this case, to speak of \u201crestor[ing] civil and political rights\u201d [189] is to refer to an entire composite of rights. Estrada theorizes that because there was a sweeping reference to this collectivity, then everything in the \u2018basket\u2019 has been restored.\n\nEstrada\u2019s theory fails on two points. First, it fails to consider the consequences of statutory requirements which specifically refer to the rights of suffrage and to hold public office. Second, it fails to recognize that the language used in the pardon is equivocal at best, and, worse, the conclusion he derives from this equivocal language is even contradicted by other examples previously considered in jurisprudence. Thus, he insists on a conclusion that does not logically follow from his premises.\n\nEstrada capitalizes on the broad conception of civil and political rights as including in its scope the rights of suffrage and the right to hold public office. That is precisely the handicap in his theory: It is broad; it fails to account for requirements relating to specific rights.\n\nAs against the broad concept of civil and political rights as an expansive composite or a vast spectrum of rights having to do with liberty and membership in the political community, Articles 36 and 41 of the Revised Penal Code specifically deal with the rights of suffrage and to hold public office.\n\nJuxtaposed with the manifold category of civil and political rights, the effect of Articles 36 and 41 is that, in the specific context of the President\u2019s exercise of the power to grant pardon to a convict, the rights of suffrage and to hold public office are segregated from all other similar rights.\n\nThis segregation is not grounded on whim. It hearkens to the fundamental distinction between public office as a public trust, on the one hand, and pardon as a private act, on the other. The special requirement of express restoration or remission affirms what was earlier discussed to be the need to desegregate, or to bridge the disjunct between the private gesture of pardoning \u2014 originally intended only to relieve an individual\u2019s misery over the harshness of punishment \u2014 and the public consequence (no longer connected with the basic purpose of mollifying penal misery) of not only enabling a convict to participate in the selection of public officials, but to himself or herself be a repository of public trust should he or she become a public officer. To reiterate, public office \u201cpartakes of a privilege which the State grants only to such classes of persons which are most likely to exercise it for the common good .\u201d [190]\n\nConsistent with the public interest inherent in the rights of suffrage and holding public office, thus, if the President is to not actually say that the rights of suffrage and to hold public office are restored, there is plainly no basis for concluding that they have, in fact, been restored.\n\nSuch is the situation in this case. At no point does the pardon actually, expressly, categorically, and unmistakably say that Estrada\u2019s rights to suffrage and to hold public office have been restored. That this court \u2014 the Supreme Court of the Republic \u2014 has been asked to step in and settle the controversy is the best proof of this.\n\nApart from these, a meticulous consideration of how the restoration of Estrada\u2019s civil and political rights is worded, especially in contrast with other examples previously considered in jurisprudence, casts serious doubt on whether the restoration was as expansive as Estrada asserts.\n\nThe exact words of the pardon granted to Estrada are: \u201cHe is hereby restored to his civil and political rights.\u201d [191]\n\nIn contrast, jurisprudence is replete with pardon, working to restore civil and political rights in this wise: \u201c full civil and political rights.\u201d [192] A fact noted in one case even seems to indicate that the inclusion of the qualifier \u201cfull\u201d is common practice. In that case, the phrase \u201cfull civil and political rights\u201d was \u201cwritten on a standard printed form.\u201d [193]\n\nThis is not the occasion to rule on the sufficiency of adding the qualifier \u201cfull\u201d for purposes of restoring even the rights of suffrage and to hold public office. However, burdened with the task of interpretation, particular note should be taken by this court of President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo\u2019s deviation from previous, standard practice.\n\nThe President must be presumed to be fully cognizant of the significance and consequences of the manner by which he or she executes official acts, as well as the manner by which they are formally reduced to writing. It is revealing that former President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo chose to deviate from many historical examples and from what appears to be common practice. Aware of the significance of excluding the qualifier \u201cfull,\u201d she chose to grant pardon to Estrada under entirely generic and indistinct terms.\n\nSimilarly, the President must be presumed to be cognizant of statutes and what they require. In granting pardon to Estrada, former President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo must have been fully informed of the requirements of Articles 36 and 41 of the Revised Penal Code if it was ever her intent to restore Estrada\u2019s rights to vote and be voted for elective public office or to otherwise remit the penalty of perpetual absolute disqualification.\n\nNot only did former President Arroyo choose to shy away from qualifying the restoration of Estrada\u2019s civil and political rights as \u201cfull.\u201d She also chose, contrary to Articles 36 and 41, to be totally silent on the restoration of the rights to vote and be voted for elective public office and on the remission of the penalty of absolute disqualification. These twin circumstances \u2014 first, of her exclusion of a qualifier and, second, her silence on restoration and remission \u2014 can only mean that contrary to Estrada\u2019s contention, his rights to vote and be voted for elective public office have not been restored, and his perpetual absolute disqualification not remitted.\n\nLest misinterpretation ensue, I am not here giving rise to a false dilemma and rendering inutile the restoration of Estrada\u2019s civil and political rights. Indeed, they have been restored, all but the rights denied to him on account of the unremitted penalty of perpetual absolute disqualification, among these being the rights to vote and be voted for elective public office. That entire spectrum of rights \u201cdeal[ing] with liberty and participation in political life\u201d [194] \u2014 to mention but a few such as his right to liberty; freedom of abode and movement; privacy rights; rights of expression, association, assembly; his right to petition the government and to a redress of grievances \u2014 are his to enjoy except for the select class of rights denied to him on account of the omissions in his pardon.\n\nSimilarly, my pronouncements should not be taken as rendering illusory the concept of \u201cplenary pardon\u201d \u2014 a concept that, as Estrada pointed out, is recognized in Section 12 of the Omnibus Election Code. The President remains free to grant pardon that works to restore all of a convict\u2019s civil and political rights, even those of suffrage and to hold public office. What I have however emphasized is that, should the President choose to be so expansive in making such a restoration, he or she should be clear with his or her intentions.\n\nX\n\nThe pardon\u2019s preambular clauses militate against Estrada\u2019s position\n\nApart from the pardon\u2019s absolute silence on the matters of restoration and remission, its preambular or whereas clauses militate against the conclusion that Estrada\u2019s rights to suffrage and to hold public office have been restored.\n\nThe pardon\u2019s three preambular clauses read:\nWHEREAS, this Administration has a policy of releasing inmates who have reached the age of seventy (70),\n\nWHEREAS, Joseph Ejercito Estrada has been under detention for six and a half years,\n\nWHEREAS, Joseph Ejercito Estrada has publicly committed to no longer seek any elective position or office[.] [195]\nA preamble is \u201cnot an essential part of an act.\u201d [196] It is only an introduction which indicates intent or purpose . In and of itself, it cannot be the source of rights and obligations. Thus, \u201c[w]here the meaning of [an instrument] is clear and unambiguous, the preamble can neither expand nor restrict its operation, much less prevail over its text.\" [197] Stated otherwise, it may be resorted to only when the instrument is \u201cambiguous and difficult of interpretation.\u201d [198]\n\nIn People v. Judge Purisima , [199] this court had occasion to interpret an act of the President (who then held the power to legislate) through a reading of whereas clauses. [200] People v. Judge Purisima concluded, referring to \u201cthe presence of events which led to or precipitated the enactment of P.D. 9\u2026 [as] clearly spelled out in the \u2018Whereas\u2019 clauses,\u2019\u201d [201] that Presidential Decree No. 9 excluded instances where a defendant carried bladed, pointed, or blunt weapons in situations which were not related to the purposes of Proclamation No. 1081 and General Orders Nos. 6 and 7. Further identifying the purposes for the issuance of Proclamation No. 1081, this court also read two of Proclamation No. 1081\u2019s own whereas clauses [202] and concluded that it was aimed at putting an end to subversive activities. Thus, this court concluded that the act of carrying bladed, pointed, or blunt weapons was only punishable to the extent that it was done in the context of subversive activities.\n\nJurisprudence and other official acts of this court are replete with instances in which reference to preambular clauses was resorted to in interpreting instruments other than statutes and official acts of the President. In Licaros v. Gatmaitan , [203] this court sustained the Court of Appeals\u2019 reference to a whereas clause in a contract between private parties ( i.e. , a memorandum of agreement) and thereby the conclusion that the parties \u201cintended to treat their agreement as one of conventional subrogation.\u201d [204] In Kuwait Airways Corporation v. Philippine Airlines, Inc. , [205] it was impliedly acknowledged that resort to a whereas clause is permissible in interpreting a contract entered into by the government; except that, because the circumstances have changed, it was deemed unnecessary to proceed to an interpretation in light of the relevant whereas clause. [206] In Conte v. Palma , [207] this court referred to whereas clauses in interpreting a resolution issued by the Social Security System. [208] Similarly, this court\u2019s En Banc resolution in A.M. No. 99-8-01-SC, [209] issued by this court in the exercise of its rule-making power, cited a statute\u2019s [210] whereas clause.\n\nThe pardon extended to Estrada is definite by its omission: There is neither an express restoration of Estrada\u2019s rights to vote and be voted for elective public office nor a remission of his perpetual absolute disqualification. To this extent, it is clear and unambiguous. This should suffice to put an end to Estrada\u2019s asseverations that he was qualified to run for Mayor of Manila.\n\nNevertheless, even if the position that there remains room for interpretation was to be indulged, a reading of the pardon as a whole , and an illumination, through the preambular clauses, of the pardon\u2019s supposed ambiguity, will lead to the same conclusion: Estrada was and remains to be disqualified.\n\nAs in Purisima , the pardon\u2019s whereas clauses indicate events and considerations that precipitated or led to the grant of pardon. More specifically, the third whereas clause reveals that the pardon was premised on Estrada\u2019s prior, public commitment of disabling himself from being a candidate in an election ( i.e. , \u201cto no longer seek any elective position or office\u201d). [211]\n\nThe preceding discussions underscored the nature of the power to pardon (in particular, and to extend clemency, in general) as being fundamentally a matter of executive discretion. However, that this is a matter resting on the President\u2019s prerogative is no license for the President to heedlessly brandish it. As with all other powers vested in the executive, it is a power that is not to be abused. It cannot be exercised arbitrarily, whimsically, or capriciously. The President may well be a despot, otherwise.\n\nThus, if the power to pardon were ever to be invoked, it must remain true to its reason for existence: to correct \u201cinfirmities, deficiencies or flaws in the administration of justice;\u201d [212] to \u201cmitigat[e] whatever harshness might be generated by a too strict an application of the law[;]\u201d [213] or to otherwise \u201ctemper the gravity of [a punishment\u2019s] wrath.\u201d [214] To the extent, therefore, that the power to pardon is exercised in a manner that evinces nothing more than the indulgence of caprices, an issue that may properly be taken cognizance of by this court arises: grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction.\n\nIn stating this, I remain mindful of this court\u2019s pronouncement in 2007 in People v. Rocha , [215] which I have cited earlier. At initial glance, Rocha appears to totally erode the power of judicial review in relation to the grant of executive clemency:\nThis Court cannot review, much less preempt, the exercise of executive clemency under the pretext of preventing the accused from evading the penalty of reclusion perpetua or from trifling with our judicial system. Clemency is not a function of the judiciary; it is an executive function. Thus, it is the President, not the judiciary, who should exercise caution and utmost circumspection in the exercise of executive clemency in order to prevent a derision of the criminal justice system. We cannot and shall not deny accused-appellants\u2019 Motions to Withdraw Appeal just because of their intention of applying for executive clemency. With the Constitution bestowing upon the Executive the power to grant clemency, it behoves the Court to pass the ball to the President and let her determine the fate of accused-appellants. [216]\nHowever, a meticulous reading of Rocha reveals that its pronouncements were made in a very specific context, i.e. , the issue of whether this court should allow the withdrawal of the appeals of accused-appellants in order that they may avail themselves of executive clemency. In making the quoted pronouncement, this court merely affirmed the basic precept that the power to extend clemency is a choice for the President \u2014 and not for any other institution, such as this court \u2014 to make. Thus, it would be improper for this court to take any action that would effectively prevent the President from even making that choice.\n\nRocha was a deferential statement that recognized where the power to extend clemency was lodged. It was a recognition that this court could not preempt the grant of clemency. At no point, however, did Rocha sanction the fanciful exercise of the power. Nowhere did it say that the power granted to the President may be divorced from its raison d\u2019 etre.\n\nWhile it behooves this court to extend to the President the presumption that the grant is attended with good reason, so, too, this court should not indulge a patently frivolous exercise of presidential discretion.\n\nPresently, this court finds itself grappling with pardon extended to a deposed President of the Republic who was convicted for the crime of plunder.\n\nJoseph Ejercito Estrada is no common convict. In him was reposed the trust of an overwhelming number of Filipinos. He was elected to nothing less than the highest office of the land. Assuming the presidency, he swore, invoking the name of God, to \u201cfaithfully and conscientiously fulfil [his] duties as President[; to] preserve and defend [the] Constitution[;] and [to] consecrate [himself] to the service of the Nation.\u201d [217] This notwithstanding, he is a man, who, tormented with recriminations of massive corruption and failing to exculpate himself in the eyes of the Filipino people, was left with no recourse but to leave the Presidency. He stood trial for and was convicted of plunder: a conviction that endures and stands unreversed.\n\nA ruling on this petition cannot be bereft of context, both of the present and of our history. Similarly, this court cannot turn a blind eye on its own recognition of the gravity and grievousness that Estrada\u2019s conviction for plunder entails.\n\nIn 2001, in Estrada v. Sandiganbayan , [218] this court, against the asseverations of Estrada himself, ruled that plunder is inherently immoral, i.e. , malum in se . In so doing, this court, quoting the concurring opinion of Justice Vicente V. Mendoza, emphasized that any doubt on the inherent immorality of plunder \u201cmust be deemed to have been resolved in the affirmative by the decision of Congress in 1993 to include it among the heinous crimes punishable by reclusion perpetua to death.\u201d [219] Estrada v. Sandiganbayan , quoting People v. Echegaray , [220] unequivocally underscored the abhorrence that animates the classification of plunder as a heinous crime punishable by death. This court did not mince words:\nThere are crimes, however, in which the abomination lies in the significance and implications of the subject criminal acts in the scheme of the larger socio-political and economic context in which the state finds itself to be struggling to develop and provide for its poor and underprivileged masses. Reeling from decades of corrupt tyrannical rule that bankrupted the government and impoverished the population, the Philippine Government must muster the political will to dismantle the culture of corruption, dishonesty, greed and syndicated criminality that so deeply entrenched itself in the structures of society and the psyche of the populace. [With the government] terribly lacking the money to provide even the most basic services to its people, any form of misappropriation or misapplication of government funds translates to an actual threat to the very existence of government, and in turn, the very survival of the people it governs over. Viewed in this context, no less heinous are the effects and repercussions of crimes like qualified bribery, destructive arson resulting in death, and drug offenses involving government officials, employees or officers, that their perpetrators must not be allowed to cause further destruction and damage to society. [221] (Emphasis supplied)\nTurning its attention specifically to Republic Act No. 7080, the Anti-Plunder Law, Estrada v. Sandiganbayan stated:\nOur nation has been racked by scandals of corruption and obscene profligacy of officials in high places which have shaken its very foundation. The anatomy of graft and corruption has become more elaborate in the corridors of time as unscrupulous people relentlessly contrive more and more ingenious ways to bilk the coffers of the government. Drastic and radical measures are imperative to fight the increasingly sophisticated, extraordinarily methodical and economically catastrophic looting of the national treasury. Such is the Plunder Law, especially designed to disentangle those ghastly tissues of grand-scale corruption which, if left unchecked, will spread like a malignant tumor and ultimately consume the moral and institutional fiber of our nation. The Plunder Law, indeed, is a living testament to the will of the legislature to ultimately eradicate this scourge and thus secure society against the avarice and other venalities in public office . [222] (Emphasis supplied)\nSection 2 of Republic Act No. 7080, as amended, provides for the definition of and penalties for plunder, as follows:\nSection 2. Definition of the Crime of Plunder; Penalties. \u2014 Any public officer who, by himself or in connivance with members of his family, relatives by affinity or consanguinity, business associates, subordinates or other persons, amasses, accumulates or acquires ill-gotten wealth through a combination or series of overt or criminal acts as described in Section 1(d) hereof in the aggregate amount or total value of at least Fifty million pesos (P50,000,000.00) shall be guilty of the crime of plunder and shall be punished by reclusion perpetua to death. Any person who participated with the said public officer in the commission of an offense contributing to the crime of plunder shall likewise be punished for such offense. In the imposition of penalties, the degree of participation and the attendance of mitigating and extenuating circumstances, as provided by the Revised Penal Code, shall be considered by the court. The court shall declare any and all ill-gotten wealth and their interests and other incomes and assets including the properties and shares of stocks derived from the deposit or investment thereof forfeited in favor of the State.\nThis technical-legal definition notwithstanding, in common understanding, to plunder is to pillage or to ransack. It denotes more than wrongful taking as to amount to common larceny. Synonymous with despoiling and marauding, plundering evokes the devastation wrought by hordes laying waste to an enemy. [223] By plundering, a subjugator impresses the fact of its having vanquished another by arrogating unto itself the spoils of conquest and rendering more ignominious an otherwise simple defeat.\n\nPlundering as a crime and by its scale, therefore, entails more than greed and covetousness. It conjures the image of a public officer deluded in the thought that he or she is some overlord, free to ravage and entitled to seize all that his or her realm can provide. It entails more than ordinary moral turpitude ( i.e. , an inherently immoral act) [224] as acts like theft, robbery, bribery, profiteering, estafa, extortion, and embezzlement have been categorized. [225] It evinces such a degree of depravity and debasement so heinous that, were it not for the subsequent enactment of a statute ( i.e. , Republic Act No. 9346), it would remain punishable by death.\n\nRecognition must be given to the legislative wisdom underlying the choice of penalty. This is not only with respect to the severity of punishment chosen ( i.e. , deprivation of life or deprivation of liberty for the longest duration contemplated by the scale of penalties under the Revised Penal Code) but similarly with all other accessories that the penalties of reclusion perpetua and/or death entail. Congress, in choosing to penalize plunder with reclusion perpetua to death, must certainly have been cognizant of how these penalties did not only entail the deprivation of the right to life and/or liberty, but also of how, consistent with Articles 40 and 41 of the Revised Penal Code, they carried the accessory penalty of perpetual absolute disqualification.\n\nTo recognize this legislative wisdom is, thus, to recognize that penalizing plunder inherently entails the exclusion of a convict from elective exercises for public office, both as a candidate and as a voter, as well as from offices and public employments. This is consistent with the recognition that plunder is an \u201cabomination . . . in the scheme of the larger socio-political and economic context.\u201d [226] Through the penalty of perpetual absolute disqualification, it is, thus, ensured that a person convicted of plunder will no longer find himself or herself in the same setting, i.e. , holding (elective) public office, which, in the first place, enabled the commission of plunder.\n\nIt is against this backdrop of plunder as a social \u201cabomination\u201d [227] as well as \u201ccorruption and obscene profligacy of officials in high places\u201d [228] that Estrada insists on a pardon that worked to restore his rights to vote and be voted for elective public office. Bereft of any clue as to the intent behind the grant of pardon, such grant is mind-boggling. It, and its statement that Estrada is restored to his civil and political rights, appear to defy the disdain which animates the policy against plunder.\n\nTo reiterate, however, a President\u2019s grant of pardon must be presumed to be grounded on the basic nature of pardon as a means for tempering the harshness of punishment. A reading of the preamble or whereas clauses of the pardon granted to Estrada will reveal that, indeed, the pardon was animated by nothing more than a desire to salve Estrada\u2019s suffering.\n\nConsider the recognition made in the first and second preambular clauses that Estrada was already more than 70 years old and had been in detention for about six and a half years. These preambular clauses provide context to why President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo saw wisdom in tempering Estrada\u2019s suffering: Keeping in prison a septuagenarian \u2014 a man who could well be considered to be in the twilight years of his life \u2014 may be too severe; anyway, Estrada had already been deprived of liberty for a considerable length of time.\n\nThe third preambular clause is even more revealing. It unveils the undertaking made by Estrada (acknowledged and unchallenged by him through his unqualified handwritten acceptance) that he would no longer embark on the very same affair, i.e., (elective) public office, that facilitated his commission of plunder. The inclusion of the third preambular clause is not empty rhetoric. It is an indispensable qualifier indicating that Estrada was pardoned precisely in view of his promise to no longer seek (elective) public office. Similarly, it establishes that the grant of pardon notwithstanding, there is no betrayal of the fundamental policy of aversion against plunder as an affront to \u201cthe larger socio-political and economic context .\u201d [229]\n\nAccordingly, any reading of the phrase on which Estrada capitalizes \u2014 \u201c[h]e is hereby restored to his civil and political rights\u201d \u2014 must be made in accordance with the qualifier evinced by an undertaking Estrada himself made \u201cto no longer seek any elective position or office.\u201d [230] Read as such, the pardon could not have possibly worked to reverse the effects of the penalty of perpetual absolute disqualification or to otherwise restore his right to vote in any election for any popular elective office or to be elected to such office.\n\nXI\n\nEstrada\u2019s re-incarceration is not a proper issue in this case.\n\nDrawing attention to Estrada\u2019s undertaking, Risos-Vidal theorizes that Estrada was granted a conditional pardon, i.e, that it was laden with a resolutory condition and that, as Estrada reneged on his undertaking, the rights vested by the pardon must be deemed extinguished. Citing Article 159 of the Revised Penal Code, Risos-Vidal, thus, suggests that Estrada should once again be incarcerated:\nThus, clearly, when Joseph Estrada himself intentionally and wilfully breached his pardon when he filed his certificate of candidacy for the position of Mayor of the City of Manila, he is guilty of breach of the conditions of the pardon which puts and [sic] end to the pardon itself and thereby immediately restoring the terms of conviction imposed by the Sandiganbayan. He should therefore be recommitted to prisi\u00f3n consistent with Article 159 of the Revised Penal Code which provides:\nART. 159. Other Cases of Evasion of Service of Sentence. \u2014 The penalty of prisi\u00f3n correccional in its minimum period shall be imposed upon the convict who, having been granted conditional pardon by the Chief Executive, shall violate any of the conditions of such pardon. However, if the penalty remitted by the granting of such pardon be higher than six years, the convict shall then suffer the unexpired portion of his original sentence. [231]\nEstrada counters that he was \u201cgranted an absolute pardon and thereby restored to his full civil and political rights, including the right to seek public elective [sic] office.\u201d [232] Estrada, therefore, construes an \u201cabsolute pardon\u201d as one with sweeping, all-encompassing effects.\n\nAs against the pardon\u2019s premise of Estrada\u2019s commitment to no longer seek any elective position or office is Estrada\u2019s acceptance:\n\nReceived & accepted\n\nJoseph E. Estrada (sgd.)\nDATE: 26 Oct. \u201807\nTIME: 3:35 P.M. [233]\n\nMade in Estrada\u2019s own handwriting, the acceptance articulates no qualification or reservation. Hence, it is an acceptance that is inclusive of his promise to no longer seek elective public office.\n\nNevertheless, the matter of Estrada\u2019s re-incarceration as a possible consequence of the occurrence of a resolutory condition is no longer essential to the disposition of this case. After all, this case pertains to a petition for disqualification. What this court is called upon to rule on is Estrada\u2019s qualification to run for Mayor of Manila.\n\nIn the limited context that excludes the question of Estrada\u2019s possible re-incarceration, the materiality of his acceptance is in how such acceptance was imperative in order to bring the pardon to effect. As noted in Monsanto , \u201c[a] pardon is a deed, to the validity of which delivery is essential, and delivery is not complete without acceptance.\" [234] This, too, is reflected in the pardon\u2019s text, the last paragraph of which reads:\nUpon acceptance of this pardon by JOSEPH EJERCITO ESTRADA, this pardon shall take effect. [235] XII\n\nEstrada\u2019s disqualification not affected by the lapse of more than two years since his release from prison\n\nHaving settled on Estrada\u2019s disqualification, it is worth emphasizing (in the interest of settling whatever lingering doubts there may be) that his disqualification is not negated by the statement in Section 40(a) of the Local Government Code that the disqualification relating to \u201c[t]hose sentenced by final judgment for an offense involving moral turpitude or for an offense punishable by one (1) year or more of imprisonment\u201d shall last for \u201ctwo (2) years after serving sentence.\u201d This, even if Section 40 of the Local Government Code is the specific ground relied upon by Risos-Vidal in seeking to disqualify Estrada.\n\nThe relation between Article 30 of the Revised Penal Code \u2014 on the effects of perpetual absolute disqualification \u2014 and Section 40(a) of the Local Government Code was extensively discussed in Romeo Jalosjos v. COMELEC : [236]\nWell-established is the rule that every new statute should be construed in connection with those already existing in relation to the same subject matter and all should be made to harmonize and stand together, if they can be done by any fair and reasonable interpretation.\n\n. . . .\n\nKeeping with the above-mentioned statutory construction principle, the Court observes that the conflict between these provisions of law may be properly reconciled. In particular, while Section 40(a) of the LGC allows a prior convict to run for local elective office after the lapse of two (2) years from the time he serves his sentence, the said provision should not be deemed to cover cases wherein the law imposes a penalty, either as principal or accessory, which has the effect of disqualifying the convict to run for elective office . An example of this would be Article 41 of the RPC, which imposes the penalty of perpetual absolute disqualification as an accessory to the principal penalties of reclusion perpetua and reclusion temporal[.]\n\n. . . .\n\nPertinently, it is observed that the import of Article 41 in relation to Article 30 of the RPC is more direct and specific in nature \u2013 insofar as it deprives the candidate to run for elective office due to his conviction \u2013 as compared to Section 40(a) of the LGC which broadly speaks of offenses involving moral turpitude and those punishable by one (1) year or more of imprisonment without any consideration of certain disqualifying effects to one\u2019s right to suffrage. Accordingly, Section 40(a) of the LGC should be considered as a law of general application and therefore, must yield to the more definitive RPC provisions in line with the principle of lex specialis derogat generali \u2013 general legislation must give way to special legislation on the same subject, and generally is so interpreted as to embrace only cases in which the special provisions are not applicable. In other words, where two statutes are of equal theoretical application to a particular case, the one specially designed therefor should prevail.\n\nIn the present case, petitioner was sentenced to suffer the principal penalties of reclusion perpetua and reclusion temporal which, pursuant to Article 41 of the RPC, carried with it the accessory penalty of perpetual absolute disqualification and in turn, pursuant to Article 30 of the RPC, disqualified him to run for elective office. As discussed, Section 40(a) of the LGC would not apply to cases wherein a penal provision \u2013 such as Article 41 in this case \u2013 directly and specifically prohibits the convict from running for elective office. Hence, despite the lapse of two (2) years from petitioner\u2019s service of his commuted prison term, he remains bound to suffer the accessory penalty of perpetual absolute disqualification which consequently, disqualifies him to run as mayor for Zamboanga City .\n\nNotably, Article 41 of the RPC expressly states that one who is previously convicted of a crime punishable by reclusion perpetua or reclusion temporal continues to suffer the accessory penalty of perpetual absolute disqualification even though pardoned as to the principal penalty, unless the said accessory penalty shall have been expressly remitted in the pardon. In this case, the same accessory penalty had not been expressly remitted in the Order of Commutation or by any subsequent pardon and as such, petitioner\u2019s disqualification to run for elective office is deemed to subsist. [237] (Emphasis supplied, citations omitted)\nSimilarly, in this case, it is of no consequence that, by the time Estrada filed his candidacy and sought election as Mayor of the City of Manila, more than (2) years had lapsed since he was released from incarceration following President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo\u2019s grant, and his acceptance, of pardon.\n\nIn sum, Estrada was disqualified to run for Mayor of the City of Manila in the May 13, 2013 elections. Moreover, his perpetual absolute disqualification not having been remitted, and his rights to vote and be voted for elective public office not having been restored, Estrada remains bound to suffer the effects of the penalty of perpetual absolute disqualification, as listed in Article 30 of the Revised Penal Code. Specifically, he remains disqualified from exercising the right to vote in any election for any popular elective office, and he remains barred from occupying any public office, elective, or otherwise.\n\nXIII\n\nOn the supposed disenfranchisement of voters and disregard of the sovereign will\n\nEstrada warns against the \u201cmassive disenfranchisement of votes [sic]\u201d [238] and cautions against disrespecting \u201cthe sovereign will of the people as expressed through the ballot.\u201d [239] In doing so, he makes much of the margin of more than 35,000 votes by which he edged out Lim. [240]\n\nEstrada is very loosely invoking the concept of a \u201csovereign\u201d as though a plurality of votes is the sole determinant of the \u201csovereign will.\u201d\n\nIn the first place, what is involved here is merely an election for a local elective position. Certainly, the voters of a single local government unit ought not to be equated with the \u201csovereign Filipino people.\u201d So blithely is Estrada celebrating his 349,770 votes, he seems to forget that Lim was not even too far off with 313,764 votes.\n\nEstrada celebrates the casting of votes in his favor as a seemingly indubitable expression of the sovereign will in trusting him with elective public office. He forgets that a mere three years prior, the voters, not just of the City of Manila, but of the entire Republic, repudiated him and rejected his attempt to once again secure the Presidency. He placed a distant second, behind by more than 5.72 million votes, to President Benigno Simeon Aquino III.\n\nEstrada did secure more votes than Lim, that much can be conceded; but these votes were cast in favor of an ineligible candidate, i.e. , one who was no candidate at all.\n\nThe matter of eligibility relates to circumstances personally pertaining to a candidate, e.g., citizenship, residency, age, lack of a prior conviction, and literacy. No amount of votes can cure a candidate\u2019s ineligibility. It could not, for instance, turn a 34-year-old person who filed a certificate of candidacy for Senator into a 35-year-old and suddenly qualify that person for election as a Senator. The matter of qualification is entirely beyond the mere plurality of votes.\n\nIn the context of constitutional democracy, the sovereign will is as effectively expressed in the official acts of public institutions. The Filipino people speak as much through the laws enacted by their elected representatives as they do through the ballot. Among these laws are those which prescribe the qualifications for elective public offices. Thus, by these requirements, the sovereign Filipino people delimit those who may be elected to public office. Among these, too, is the Revised Penal Code, Articles 36 and 41 of which require the express restoration of the rights of suffrage and to hold public office, or otherwise the express remission of the penalty of perpetual absolute disqualification. So too, the Filipino people speak through the Constitution they have adopted, a basic precept of which is that public office is a public trust. Thus, matters relating to public office cannot be expediently dispensed with through the private act of granting pardon unless such grant be in compliance with legally established requisites.\n\nThe plurality of voters in Manila may appear to have decided contrary to what is expressed in our laws, but this cannot trump the sovereign will as expressed in our Constitution and laws.\n\nXIV\n\nPetitioner-intervenor Alfredo S. Lim is the qualified candidate who obtained the highest number of votes in the election for Mayor of the City of Manila\n\nHaving settled that Estrada suffered and continues to suffer from perpetual absolute disqualification, it is proper to resolve the resultant issue of who must be named Mayor of the City of Manila in lieu of Estrada.\n\nIn this court\u2019s April 16, 2013 decision in Maquiling v. COMELEC , [241] we revisited the 1912 case of Topacio v. Paredes [242] from which originated the often-quoted phrase \u201cthe wreath of victory cannot be transferred from an ineligible candidate to any other candidate when the sole question is the eligibility of the one receiving a plurality of the legally cast ballots.\u201d [243] This was the progenitor of the principle that a supposed second-placer cannot be proclaimed the winner in an election contest.\n\nAs in the present case, Maquiling involved a petition for disqualification [244] anchored on Section 40 of the Local Government Code. [245] Thus, the principles laid down by Maquiling as to who must occupy an elective position following the determination that a candidate was disqualified are squarely applicable in this case.\n\nAs explained in Maquiling , the \u2018often-quoted phrase\u2019 from Topacio was a mere obiter dictum:\nThis phrase is not even the ratio decidendi; it is a mere obiter dictum. The Court was comparing \u201cthe effect of a decision that a candidate is not entitled to the office because of fraud or irregularities in the elections x x x [with] that produced by declaring a person ineligible to hold such an office.\u201d\n\nThe complete sentence where the phrase is found is part of a comparison and contrast between the two situations, thus:\nAgain, the effect of a decision that a candidate is not entitled to the office because of fraud or irregularities in the elections is quite different from that produced by declaring a person ineligible to hold such an office. In the former case the court, after an examination of the ballots may find that some other person than the candidate declared to have received a plura[l]ity by the board of canvassers actually received the greater number of votes, in which case the court issues its mandamus to the board of canvassers to correct the returns accordingly; or it may find that the manner of holding the election and the returns are so tainted with fraud or illegality that it cannot be determined who received a [plurality] of the legally cast ballots. In the latter case, no question as to the correctness of the returns or the manner of casting and counting the ballots is before the deciding power, and generally the only result can be that the election fails entirely. In the former, we have a contest in the strict sense of the word, because of the opposing parties are striving for supremacy. If it be found that the successful candidate (according to the board of canvassers) obtained a plurality in an illegal manner, and that another candidate was the real victor, the former must retire in favor of the latter. In the other case, there is not, strictly speaking, a contest, as the wreath of victory cannot be transferred from an ineligible candidate to any other candidate when the sole question is the eligibility of the one receiving a plurality of the legally cast ballots. In the one case the question is as to who received a plurality of the legally cast ballots; in the other, the question is confined to the personal character and circumstances of a single individual.\nNote that the sentence where the phrase is found starts with \u201cIn the other case, there is not, strictly speaking, a contest\u201d in contrast to the earlier statement, \u201cIn the former, we have a contest in the strict sense of the word, because of the opposing parties are striving for supremacy.\u201d\n\nThe Court in Topacio v. Paredes cannot be said to have held that \u201cthe wreath of victory cannot be transferred from an ineligible candidate to any other candidate when the sole question is the eligibility of the one receiving a plurality of the legally cast ballots.\u201d\n\nA proper reading of the case reveals that the ruling therein is that since the Court of First Instance is without jurisdiction to try a disqualification case based on the eligibility of the person who obtained the highest number of votes in the election, its jurisdiction being confined \u201cto determine which of the contestants has been duly elected\u201d the judge exceeded his jurisdiction when he \u201cdeclared that no one had been legally elected president of the municipality of Imus at the general election held in that town on 4 June 1912\u201d where \u201cthe only question raised was whether or not Topacio was eligible to be elected and to hold the office of municipal president.\u201d\n\nThe Court did not rule that Topacio was disqualified and that Abad as the second placer cannot be proclaimed in his stead. . . . [246] (Citations omitted)\nBy definition, an ineligible individual is not even a candidate in the first place. [247] It is, therefore, erroneous to refer to him or her as a \u201cwinner,\u201d that is, as the \u201cwinning candidate ,\u201d should he or she obtain the plurality of votes. Consequently, it is illogical to refer to the candidates who are trailing in the vote count as \u201closers,\u201d which is what labels like \u201csecond-placer\u201d entail. As his or her ineligibility as a candidate remains, the number of votes cast for him or her is ultimately not decisive of who must be proclaimed as winner: [248]\nThe ballot cannot override the constitutional and statutory requirements for qualifications and disqualifications of candidates. When the law requires certain qualifications to be possessed or that certain disqualifications be not possessed by persons desiring to serve as elective public officials, those qualifications must be met before one even becomes a candidate. When a person who is not qualified is voted for and eventually garners the highest number of votes, even the will of the electorate expressed through the ballot cannot cure the defect in the qualifications of the candidate. To rule otherwise is to trample upon and rent asunder the very law that sets forth the qualifications and disqualifications of candidates. We might as well write off our election laws if the voice of the electorate is the sole determinant of who should be proclaimed worthy to occupy elective positions in our republic. [249]\nTo rule as such is not tantamount to disrespecting the will of the electorate. As was very recently said in Hayudini v. COMELEC : [250]\n[T]he will of the electorate is still actually respected even when the votes for the ineligible candidate are disregarded. The votes cast in favor of the ineligible candidate are not considered at all in determining the winner of an election for these do not constitute the sole and total expression of the sovereign voice. On the other hand, those votes for the eligible and legitimate candidates form an integral part of said voice, which must equally be given due respect, if not more. [251]\nContemporary jurisprudence has seen the repudiation of the position that a \u201csecond-placer\u201d cannot be proclaimed a winner in lieu of an ineligible candidate.\n\nThis court\u2019s 2012 decisions in Aratea v. COMELEC [252] and Dominador Jalosjos, Jr. v. COMELEC [253] ruled that a certificate of candidacy that was cancelled for being void ab initio, it having been filed by a candidate who falsely claimed that he was eligible, produces no effect, it \u201ccannot give rise to a valid candidacy, and much less to valid votes.\u201d [254] Thus, the votes cast for the ineligible candidate should be considered \u201cstray votes and should not be counted.\u201d [255]\n\nThis court\u2019s June 25, 2013 resolution in Svetlana Jalosjos v. COMELEC [256] expounded on the reasons for enabling the qualified candidate (the erstwhile \u201csecond-placer, unless of course, he is himself ineligible) who obtained the highest number of votes to assume the contested office. It has also clarified the proper operation of Section 44 of the Local Government Code on the rules on succession in case of a permanent vacancy in the Office of the Mayor:\nThere is another more compelling reason why the eligible candidate who garnered the highest number of votes must assume the office. The ineligible candidate who was proclaimed and who already assumed office is a de facto officer by virtue of the ineligibility.\n\nThe rule on succession in Section 44 of the Local Government Code cannot apply in instances when a de facto officer is ousted from office and the de jure officer takes over. The ouster of a de facto officer cannot create a permanent vacancy as contemplated in the Local Government Code. There is no vacancy to speak of as the de jure officer, the rightful winner in the elections, has the legal right to assume the position. [257]\nDominador Jalosjos, Jr. has not only ruled that the votes for an ineligible candidate are stray votes. It has also impressed upon the COMELEC that it is duty-bound to \u201cmotu proprio bar from running for public office those suffering from perpetual special disqualification by virtue of a final judgment.\u201d [258]\nEven without a petition under either Section 12 or Section 78 of the Omnibus Election Code, or under Section 40 of the Local Government Code, the COMELEC is under a legal duty to cancel the certificate of candidacy of anyone suffering from the accessory penalty of perpetual special disqualification to run for public office by virtue of a final judgment of conviction. The final judgment of conviction is notice to the COMELEC of the disqualification of the convict from running for public office. The law itself bars the convict from running for public office, and the disqualification is part of the final judgment of conviction. The final judgment of the court is addressed not only to the Executive branch, but also to other government agencies tasked to implement the final judgment under the law.\n\nWhether or not the COMELEC is expressly mentioned in the judgment to implement the disqualification, it is assumed that the portion of the final judgment on disqualification to run for elective public office is addressed to the COMELEC because under the Constitution the COMELEC is duty bound to \u201c[e]nforce and administer all laws and regulations relative to the conduct of an election.\u201d The disqualification of a convict to run for public office under the Revised Penal Code, as affirmed by final judgment of a competent court, is part of the enforcement and administration of \u201call laws\u201d relating to the conduct of elections.\n\nTo allow the COMELEC to wait for a person to file a petition to cancel the certificate of candidacy of one suffering from perpetual special disqualification will result in the anomaly that these cases so grotesquely exemplify. Despite a prior perpetual special disqualification, Jalosjos was elected and served twice as mayor. The COMELEC will be grossly remiss in its constitutional duty to \"enforce and administer all laws\" relating to the conduct of elections if it does not motu proprio bar from running for public office those suffering from perpetual special disqualification by virtue of a final judgment. [259]\nApplying these principles, the votes cast for private respondent Joseph Ejercito Estrada, a disqualified and ineligible candidate, must be held as stray votes. Petitioner-intervenor Alfredo S. Lim is the qualified candidate who obtained the highest number of votes in the contest to be elected Mayor of the City of Manila in the May 13, 2013 elections. Accordingly, he must be proclaimed the duly elected Mayor of the City of Manila, lest there be grounds, not contemplated in this opinion, barring his proclamation.\n\nFinal note\n\nNot so long ago, our people were moved by revelations of wrongdoing committed by one who temporarily occupied one of the most important public offices of our society \u2014 the Presidency. Our people\u2019s collective voices uttered in private conversations avalanched into a people\u2019s movement. This voice found its way into the halls of the House of Representatives and the Senate in a historic impeachment proceeding. Events unravelled, which caused the offending President to vacate Malaca\u00f1ang, to be considered resigned, and to finally be replaced.\n\nHis prosecution subsequently ensued. A first in our history, the Sandiganbayan found him guilty of committing the highest possible crime attended by graft and corruption. This betrayal of the public trust is called plunder. It is statutorily punished by a penalty of reclusion perpetua and permanent disqualification from public office.\n\nThe person convicted of plunder now walks free among us. He did not spend a single day in an ordinary jail. There is no question that he was pardoned. Today, the majority completes the circle by reading an ambiguous pardon allowing him yet again to run for public office. The majority uses the equivocal silence of the succeeding President who devised the ambiguous pardon as one of the bases to say that the convicted former President can again seek public office.\n\nThis is template for our political elite at the expense of the masses who toil and suffer from the consequences of corruption. It is hope for those who occupy high government offices who commit crimes as they await a next political term when the people\u2019s vigilance would have waned. It is the denouement in a narrative that will explain why there is no effective deterrent to corruption in high places. The pragmatism of politics takes over the highest notion that public office should be of effective public trust. The rule of law should unravel to meet this expectation.\n\nThe pardon was ambiguous. By our laws and constitutional fiat, it should have been read as perpetually prohibiting he who was convicted of plunder from again occupying any public office. This is my reading of what the values in our laws require.\n\nI do not judge respondent for who he is as a person. That is not within our constitutional competence. But as a leader, the respondent will best show that the way forward for the country he loves should be for him to repent and for him to suffer courageously the consequences of his past acts. There are things which are clearly right. There are things which are clearly wrong. For in our hearts we know that impunity, in any form, should be abhorred especially when it gives advantage to the privileged and the powerful.\n\nThus, I dissent.\n\nACCORDINGLY, contrary to the majority, I vote to GRANT the petition and the petition-in-intervention. The assailed resolutions dated April 1, 2013 of the Second Division of public respondent Commission on Elections (COMELEC), and April 23, 2013 of public respondent COMELEC, sitting En Banc, must be ANNULLED and SET ASIDE.\n\nPrivate respondent Joseph Ejercito Estrada continues to suffer the penalty of perpetual absolute disqualification and is thereby DISQUALIFIED from exercising the right to vote in any election for any popular elective office or to be elected to such office.\n\n[1] Rep.

Gonzaga-Reyes, Third Division].\n\n[204] Id. at 868\u2013872:\n\nWe agree with the finding of the Court of Appeals that the Memorandum of Agreement dated July 29, 1988 was in the nature of a conventional subrogation which requires the consent of the debtor, Anglo-Asean Bank, for its validity. We note with approval the following pronouncement of the Court of Appeals:\n\n\u201cImmediately discernible from above is the common feature of contracts involving conventional subrogation, namely, the approval of the debtor to the subrogation of a third person in place of the creditor. That Gatmaitan and Licaros had intended to treat their agreement as one of conventional subrogation is plainly borne by a stipulation in their Memorandum of Agreement, to wit:\n\n\"WHEREAS, the parties herein have come to an agreement on the nature, form and extent of their mutual prestations which they now record herein with the express conformity of the third parties concerned \" (emphasis supplied), which third party is admittedly Anglo-Asean Bank.\n\nHad the intention been merely to confer on appellant the status of a mere \"assignee\" of appellee's credit, there is simply no sense for them to have stipulated in their agreement that the same is conditioned on the \"express conformity\" thereto of Anglo-Asean Bank. That they did so only accentuates their intention to treat the agreement as one of conventional subrogation. And it is basic in the interpretation of contracts that the intention of the parties must be the one pursued (Rule 130, Section 12, Rules of Court).\n\n. . . .\n\nAs previously discussed, the intention of the parties to treat the Memorandum of Agreement as embodying a conventional subrogation is shown not only by the \"whereas clause\" but also by the signature space captioned \"WITH OUR CONFORME\" reserved for the signature of a representative of Anglo-Asean Bank . These provisions in the aforementioned Memorandum of Agreement may not simply be disregarded or dismissed as superfluous.\n\nIt is a basic rule in the interpretation of contracts that \u201c(t)he various stipulations of a contract shall be interpreted together, attributing to the doubtful ones that sense which may result from all of them taken jointly.\u201d Moreover, under our Rules of Court, it is mandated that \u201c(i)n the construction of an instrument where there are several provisions or particulars, such a construction is, if possible, to be adopted as will give effect to all.\u201d Further, jurisprudence has laid down the rule that contracts should be so construed as to harmonize and give effect to the different provisions thereof. (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)\n\n[205] 605 Phil. 474 (2009) [Per J. Tinga, Second Division].\n\n[206] Id. at 487\u2013488:\n\nOne line of argument raised by Kuwait Airways can be dismissed outright. Kuwait Airways points out that the third Whereas clause of the 1981 Commercial Agreement stated: \u201cNOW, it is hereby agreed, subject to and without prejudice to any existing or future agreements between the Government Authorities of the Contracting Parties hereto. . . .\u201d That clause, it is argued, evinces acknowledgement that from the beginning Philippine Airlines had known fully well that its rights under the Commercial Agreement would be limited by whatever agreements the Philippine and Kuwait governments may enter into later.\n\nBut can a perambulatory clause, which is what the adverted \u201cWhereas\u201d clause is, impose a binding obligation or limitation on the contracting parties? In the case of statutes, while a preamble manifests the reasons for the passage of the statute and aids in the interpretation of any ambiguities within the statute to which it is prefixed, it nonetheless is not an essential part of an act, and it neither enlarges nor confers powers. Philippine Airlines submits that the same holds true as to the preambular whereas clauses of a contract.\n\nWhat was the intention of the parties in forging the \u201cWhereas\u201d clause and the contexts the parties understood it in 1981? In order to judge the intention of the contracting parties, their contemporaneous and subsequent acts shall be principally considered, and in doing so, the courts may consider the relations existing between the parties and the purpose of the contract. In 1981, Philippine Airlines was still owned by the Philippine government. In that context, it is evident that the Philippine government, as owner Philippine Airlines, could enter into agreements with the Kuwait government that would supersede the Commercial Agreement entered into by one of its GOCCs, a scenario that changed once Philippine Airlines fell to private ownership. Philippine Airlines argues before us that the cited preambular stipulation is in fact superfluous, and we can agree in the sense that as of the time of the execution of the Commercial Agreement, it was evident, without need of stipulation, that the Philippine government could enter into an agreement with the Kuwait government that would prejudice the terms of the commercial arrangements between the two airlines. After all, Philippine Airlines then would not have been in a position to challenge the wishes of its then majority stockholder \u2013 the Philippine government. (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)\n\n[207] 332 Phil. 20 (1996) [Per J. Panganiban, En Banc].\n\n[208] Id. at 32\u201333:\n\nPetitioners\u2019 contentions are not supported by law. We hold that Res. 56 constitutes a supplementary retirement plan.\n\nA cursory examination of the preambular clauses and provisions of Res. 56 provides a number of clear indications that its financial assistance plan constitutes a supplemental retirement/pension benefits plan. In particular, the fifth preambular clause which provides that \u201cit is the policy of the Social Security Commission to promote and to protect the interest of all SSS employees, with a view to providing for their well-being during both their working and retirement years,\u201d and the wording of the resolution itself which states \u201cResolved, further, that SSS employees who availed themselves of the said life annuity (under RA 660), in appreciation and recognition of their long and faithful service, be granted financial assistance x x x\u201d can only be interpreted to mean that the benefit being granted is none other than a kind of amelioration to enable the retiring employee to enjoy (or survive) his retirement years and a reward for his loyalty and service. Moreover, it is plain to see that the grant of said financial assistance is inextricably linked with and inseparable from the application for and approval of retirement benefits under RA 660, i.e. , that availment of said financial assistance under Res. 56 may not be done independently of but only in conjunction with the availment of retirement benefits under RA 660, and that the former is in augmentation or supplementation of the latter benefits.\n\n[209] En Banc Resolution Providing for Other Sources of the Judiciary Development Fund dated September 14, 1999.\n\n[210] Pres.

CIRILO DUCA, SHERIFF III, MUNICIPAL CIRCUIT TRIAL COURT IN CITIES, BRANCH 1, CAGAYAN DE ORO CITY, RESPONDENT.\n\nD E C I S I O N\n\nBERSAMIN, J.:\n\nComplainant Conchita S. Bahala has charged grave abuse of discretion, gross misconduct and violation of the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act (Republic Act No. 3019) against respondent Cirilo Duca, Sheriff III of the Municipal Trial Court in Cities (MTCC), Branch 1, in Cagayan de Oro City in relation to his implementation of the writ of execution issued in Civil Case No. 98-July-817 entitled Estate of Casimiro Tamparong and Feliza Neri Tamparong, represented by Special Administratrix, Veronica T. Borja v. Conchita S. Bahala and Mr. Bahala (Husband) , an action for ejectment.\n\nAntecedents\n\nOn August 6, 1999, the MTCC rendered judgment in Civil Case No. 98-July-817 that was adverse to Bahala. [1] Pending appeal, the Regional Trial Court (RTC) rendered a judgment on the compromise agreement of the parties, [2] pursuant to which Bahala paid the balance of the money judgment, remained in the premises during the agreed extension of two years, and paid her monthly rentals. By the end of the two-year extension, she offered to sell the building standing on the property that she had supposedly built in good faith. Not wanting to pay for the building, the plaintiff opted to execute the judgment. On August 1, 2002, Sheriff Duca served the writ of execution, [3] but demanded P2,000.00 from her in order to delay its implementation. She delivered the amount demanded on a Saturday at the Hall of Justice in the company of her friend, Helen Peligro. Bahala averred, too, that Sheriff Duca had served the writ on her more than 10 times, and that she had given him either P200.00 or P100.00 each time. In 2003, she started to evade Sheriff Duca whenever he served the writ. [4]\n\nWithout filing his return on the writ, Sheriff Duca served a notice of auction sale on February 21, 2003, [5] stating the amount of P210,000.00 as the rentals-in-arrears due and demandable. The amount was allegedly his erroneous computation of the rentals-in-arrears due because it was not based on the decision of the RTC. Consequently, Bahala opposed the sale. In its order of May 5, 2003, [6] the RTC ruled in her favor, to wit:\n\nWherefore, defendants opposition is granted, the sheriff is enjoined from proceeding with the auction sale of defendant property and he is instead hereby directed to execute the parties\u2019 agreement regarding ejectment and removal of defendant buildings/structures from the leased property of the plaintiff.\n\nSo Ordered.\nDespite the clear order of the RTC, Sheriff Duca proceeded with the auction sale on May 13, 2003, [7] and awarded the building to the plaintiff as the sole and highest bidder. [8] On October 6, 2003, he forcibly removed all the personal belongings of the actual occupants of the building, and placed them outside the building and along the street. He padlocked the building, and warned Bahala and her lessees not to re-enter the premises. When she told him that his act was illegal, he retorted: Akong himuon ang akong gusto, akong ning i-padlock ang imong building, walay makabuot sa ako. (I will do what I want. I will padlock your building and nobody will stop me from doing this). Later that afternoon, she started to voluntarily demolish the building, but he ordered her to stop the demolition, threatening to file a case against her otherwise. [9]\n\nIn his answer, [10] Sheriff Duca denied demanding and receiving any amount from Bahala. He admitted meeting her only on four occasions, one of which was on a working day in the Hall of Justice, as she was pleading that her lessees not be informed of the writ. He also admitted not having filed any return because his implementation was not yet complete at that time, and that he informed the plaintiff about the status of the implementation of the writ. He maintained that the amount of P210,000.00 contained in the notice of auction sale was based on the computation of the arrears submitted by the plaintiff. As regards the auction sale, he received a copy of the RTC\u2019s order only on May 5, 2003 long after the property had been auctioned off on March 3, 2003. He denied using force in ejecting the occupants of the building, stating that they had voluntary removed their personal belongings themselves.\n\nThe Court resolved to re-docket this case as a regular administrative matter, and referred it to the Executive Judge of the RTC in Cagayan de Oro City for investigation and recommendation. [11]\n\nIn his report, [12] then Executive Judge Edgardo T. Lloren found and concluded that Sheriff Duca had committed simple misconduct for not filing his periodic report on the writ pursuant to Section 14, Rule 39 of the Rules of Court, and for adopting the computation of arrears made by the plaintiff. Accordingly, Judge Lloren recommended that Sheriff Duca be suspended for six months and one day without pay; and that the charges for violation of the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act be dismissed for lack of merit.\n\nThe OCA agreed with Judge Lloren\u2019s finding that Sheriff Duca had committed simple misconduct in basing the amount stated in the notice of auction sale on the computation submitted by the plaintiff. [13] It also found Sheriff Duca liable for simple neglect of duty for not complying with the requirements of Section 14, Rule 39 of the Rules of Court, and recommended his suspension without pay for six months and one day with stern warning against the commission of similar acts or omissions. [14]\n\nRuling\n\nWe agree with the findings of the OCA, but modify the recommended penalty.\n\nAs an agent of the law, a sheriff must discharge his duties with due care and utmost diligence. He cannot afford to err while serving the court\u2019s writs and processes without affecting the integrity of his office and the efficient administration of justice. [15] He is not given any discretion on the implementation of a writ of execution; hence, he must strictly abide by the prescribed procedure to avoid liability. [16]\n\nSection 14, Rule 39 of the Rules of Court requires a sheriff implementing a writ of execution (1) to make and submit a return to the court immediately upon satisfaction in part or in full of the judgment; and (2) if the judgment cannot be satisfied in full, to make a report to the court within 30 days after his receipt of the writ and state why full satisfaction could not be made. He shall continue making the report every 30 days in the proceedings undertaken by him until the judgment is fully satisfied in order to apprise the court on the status of the execution and to take necessary steps to ensure speedy execution of decisions. [17]\n\nAlthough Sheriff Duca thrice served the writ on Bahala, [18] he filed his return only on October 7, 2003 after her property had been levied and sold on public auction. [19] His excuses for his omission, that his \u201cjob was not yet finished,\u201d and that he had informed the plaintiff on the status of its implementation, did not exculpate him from administrative liability, because there is no question that the failure to file a return on the writ constituted \u201csimple neglect of duty,\u201d [20] defined as the failure of an employee to give his attention to the task expected of him, signifying a disregard of a duty resulting from carelessness or indifference. [21]\n\nIn this regard, the OCA correctly observed:\n\nAs deputy sheriff, respondent could not be unaware of Section 14, Rule 39 of the 1997 Revised Rules of Civil Procedure x x x\n\nx x x x\n\nBased on the foregoing, it is mandatory for a sheriff to make a return of the writ of execution to the court issuing it. If the judgment cannot be satisfied in full within thirty (30) days after his receipt of the writ, the officer shall report to the court and state the reason or reasons therefore. The court officer is likewise tasked to make a report to the court every thirty (30) days on the proceedings taken thereon until the judgment is satisfied in full or its effectivity expires. The raison d\u2019 etre behind this requirement is to update the court on the status of the execution and to take necessary steps to ensure the speedy execution of decision.\n\nA careful perusal of the records show that the writ of execution was issued on August 1, 2002. However, it was only more than a year later or on October 7, 2003 when respondent sheriff was able to file his return of the writ. In his testimony before the investigating judge on March 7, 2005, he was not even sure on when he first served the writ of execution upon complainant but admitted of having served the same at least three (3) times yet he failed to timely make a sheriff\u2019s return as required under Section 14, Rule 39 of the Rules of Civil Procedure. Respondent though belatedly submitted his sheriff\u2019s return and furnished a copy thereof to the complainant only on October 7, 2003.\n\nDue to respondent\u2019s failure to make a timely return and periodic progress report of the writ, the court was obviously unaware of the auction sale of defendant\u2019s property conducted by respondent-sheriff on March 3, 2003 that in its Order dated May 5, 2003, it enjoined respondent sheriff from proceeding with the auction sale of defendant\u2019s property and directed him to execute the parties\u2019 agreement regarding ejectment and removal of defendants\u2019 buildings/structures from the leased property of the plaintiff. By then, subject property was already auctioned and awarded to plaintiff, being the highest bidder and defendant\u2019s agents already ejected from subject property per his Sheriff\u2019s Return of Service dated October 7, 2003.\n\nClearly, respondent sheriff is derelict in his submission of the returns thereof. His explanation that \u201chis job was not yet finished and \u2026 talked to the plaintiff regarding the same \u201d is utterly wanting. A finding that he was remiss in the performance of his duty is thus proper under the attendant circumstances. For such nonfeasance, respondent is guilty of dereliction or simple neglect of his duty as a sheriff, because he failed to submit his Report of Service within thirty (30) days from receipt thereof and make periodic reports to the court until the judgment was fully satisfied. In fine, the gravamen of respondent\u2019s shortcoming is in his failure to observe Sec. 14, Rule 39 of the Rules of Court. [22]\nWithout doubt, Sheriff Duca played an indispensable part in the administration of justice. His duties as a sheriff included the prompt enforcement of judgments and the efficient implementation of orders and writs issued by the court. Any move or actuation in the discharge of his duties that denoted complacency, or reflected inefficiency, or constituted impropriety would equate to the disregard of the office he held. Thus, his lapses in complying with Section 14, Rule 39 of the Rules of Court constituted sufficient ground to order his dismissal, suspension from office or payment of a fine. [23]\n\nSheriff Duca\u2019s liability was not limited to his failure to file the return on the writ. The OCA recommended that he be found liable also for simple misconduct because he was guilty of the irregularity of relying on the computation of the plaintiff in charging Bahala for the arrears in rentals amounting to P210,000.00, thus:\n\nRespondent\u2019s reliance on the computation of plaintiff for the rental-in-arrears amounting to P210,000.00 contained in the Sheriff\u2019s Notice of Auction Sale is likewise irregular. He should not have put undue reliance on the computation made by a private individual not duly deputized by the court. It must be borne in mind that respondent sheriff has, as an officer of the court, the duty to compute the amount due from the judgment debtor. ( Bagano v. Paninsoro, 246 SCRA 146) For such actuation, respondent committed simple misconduct. [24]\nCompounding this liability was his admission of not inquiring whether Bahala had paid her rentals or not to the plaintiff. [25]\n\nTo be sure, the amount of P210,000.00 stated in the notice of levy did not conform with the writ of execution that stated the following amounts to be due to the plaintiff from Bahala, viz:\n\nWRIT OF EXECUTION\n\nx x x x\n\nWhereas, Judgment on compromise agreement issued in this case by the Regional Trial Court Branch 40, dated 10 November 1999, quoted as follows:\nCOMPROMISE AGREEMENT\n\nCOME NOW the parties hereto, assisted by their respective counsels, and unto this Honorable Court hereby submit the following Compromise Agreement, to wit:\n\nx x x x\n3) That the parties hereto are desirous of settling their dispute by compromise agreement and have voluntarily agreed the following:\na) THAT defendant shall pay the sum of P17,900.00 upon signing of this Compromise Agreement, P15,500.00 of which shall be taken from the amount deposited with the Clerk of Court of the Municipal Trial Court of Cagayan de Oro City to be applied in the manner as follows:\n\nP5,900.00 -- for payment of arrears in rentals as of December 30, 1999;\n\n10,000.00 -- as attorney\u2019s fees (part) per decision in Civil Case No. 98-Jul-817\n\n2,000.00 -- for reimbursement of expenses of litigation\n\nb) THAT the period of lease is extended to two (2) years commencing on January 1, 2000 and termination January 30, 2002.\n\nc) THAT the monthly rental shall be five thousand pesos (P5,000.00) payable to the office of the plaintiff within the first (5) days of each and every month without need of any demand. x x x x [26]\n\nIt was Sheriff Duca\u2019s duty as court sheriff to know the computation of the amount due in accordance with the writ of execution. [27] He should have ensured that only those ordained or decreed in the judgment would be the subject of execution. To accomplish this, he must himself compute the correct amount due from the judgment obligor or garnishee based strictly on the terms of the executory judgment, and, if necessary, he must verify the amount from the court itself; in other words, he could not rely on the computations submitted by private individuals not duly authorized to do so by the issuing court. [28] He could not delegate the official duty to compute or reckon the amounts to be realize through execution to such individuals. [29] In adopting the computations submitted by the plaintiff without himself determining whether the computations conformed to the terms of the judgment and the writ, he was guilty of simple misconduct, an act that related to any unlawful conduct prejudicial to the rights of the parties or to the right determination of the cause. [30]\n\nSheriff Duca should discharge his duties as a court sheriff with utmost care and diligence, particularly that which pertained to the implementation of orders and processes of the court. In the discharge of his duties, he acted as an agent of the court, such that any lack of care and diligence he displayed would inevitably cause the erosion of the faith of the people in the Judiciary. [31]\n\nAnent the charge of violation of Section 3(e) of the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act , Bahala did not adduce substantial evidence to establish that Sheriff Duca had demanded and received monetary consideration to delay the implementation of the writ of execution. The charge is dismissed for being without merit.\n\nWe modify the recommended penalty of suspension from office without pay for six months and one day. Under the Revised Uniform Rules on Administrative Cases in the Civil Service, simple neglect of duty and simple misconduct are less grave offenses punishable by suspension from office of one month and one day to six months for the first offense. The offense charged being Sheriff Duca\u2019s first violation, he is appropriately punished with suspension from office without pay for three months, with a stern warning that the commission of the same or similar offense will be dealt with more severely.\n\nWHEREFORE , the Court FINDS and DECLARES respondent CIRILO DUCA , Sheriff III of the Municipal Circuit Trial Court in Cities, Branch 1, in Cagayan de Oro City, GUILTY of SIMPLE MISCONDUCT and SIMPLE NEGLECT OF DUTY , and, accordingly, SUSPENDS him from office for three months without pay, with a stern warning that any similar infraction in the future will be dealt with more severely.\n\nSO ORDERED .\n\nSereno, C.J., Leonardo-De Castro, Perez , and Perlas-Bernabe, JJ ., concur.\n\n[1] Rollo, pp. 19-23.\n\n[2] Id. at 24-26.\n\n[3] Id. at 34B-36.\n\n[4] Id. at 8.\n\n[5] Id. at 39.\n\n[6] Id. at 38.\n\n[7] Id. at 11.\n\n[8] Id. at 41.\n\n[9] Id. at 11-12.\n\n[10] Id. at 61-63.\n\n[11] Id. at 85.\n\n[12] Id. at 190-202.\n\n[13] Id. at 320.\n\n[14] Id. at 321.\n\n[15] Calo v.

      "title": "PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, APPELLEE, VS. GERARDO ENUMERABLE Y DE VILLA, APPELLANT.D E C I S I O N CARPIO, J.: The CaseOn appeal is the 31 January 2013 Decision[1] of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CR HC No. 04948. The Court of Appeals affirmed the 15 February 2011 Decision[2] of the Regional Trial Court, Branch 12 of Lipa City convicting appellant Gerardo Enumerable y De Villa for violation of Section 5 of Republic Act No. 9165.The FactsThe Information dated 27 August 2004 reads:That on or about the 27th day of May, 2004 at about 11:30 o\u2019clock in the morning at Petron Gasoline Station, located at B. Morada Ave., Lipa City, Philippines and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, without authority of law, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously sell, deliver, dispose or give away to a police officer-poseur buyer, 9.88 grams of Methamphetamine Hydrochloride locally known as \u201cshabu\u201d, a dangerous drug, contained in three (3) plastic sachets.Contrary to Law.[3]Appellant pleaded not guilty to the offense charged.[4] Trial ensued.The prosecution presented two witnesses, namely: Police Officer (PO) 3 Edwalberto Villas and Police Inspector Danilo Balmes. On the other hand, appellant waived the presentation of any defense evidence.As found by the trial court, the facts are as follows:From the evidence adduced by the People, the Court finds that based on the information about a deal in shabu between the asset of PO3 Edwalberto Villas and a certain Gerry of San Pablo City, a buy-bust operation was conducted by the elements of the Batangas City Police Station with the assistance of Police Inspector Danilo Balmes of the CIDG Batangas Province on May 27, 2004 at 11:30 o\u2019clock in the morning at the Petron Gasoline Station along B. Morada Ave., Lipa City.Using two (2) pieces of marked P500.00 bills and boodle money to make the appearance of about P24,000.00, the police asset who posed as a buyer transacted with the alias Gerry upon his arrival at the gas station. After the exchange of the marked money and the three (3) plastic sachets of shabu placed in a black plastic box, alias Gerry was placed under arrest. He was later identified as Gerardo Enumerable y de Villa. The marked money was recovered from his possession by PO3 Villas who also took custody of the specimen shabu which he marked EMV 1 to EMV 3. The three (3) sachets of shabu were turned over to the Batangas Provincial Crime Laboratory, pursuant to the request for laboratory examination of P/Supt. Fausto Manzanilla, Jr., Chief of Police, Batangas City PNP on May 27, 2004 at 5:25 p.m. However, that Crime laboratory indorsed the request with the specimens on June 4, 2004 at 2:30 p.m. to the Regional Crime Laboratory in Calamba City.Police Inspector and Forensic Chemist Donna Villa P. Huelgas found the specimens positive for the presence of methamphetamine hydrochloride, a dangerous drug, as shown by Chemistry Report No. D-566-04, the authenticity and genuineness of which were admitted by accused during the pre-trial.[5]Appellant filed a Comment with Motion for Leave to File Demurrer,[6] which motion was denied by the trial court for appellant\u2019s failure to adduce any reason therefor.[7]The trial court found appellant guilty of the offense charged. The dispositive portion of the trial court\u2019s decision reads:WHEREFORE, the Court finds accused GERARDO ENUMERABLE y DE VILLA guilty beyond reasonable doubt as principal by direct participation of the crime of drug pushing as defined and penalized under Section 5, Article II of Republic Act [No.] 9165 otherwise known as the Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002 and hereby impose on him the penalty of life imprisonment and to pay a fine of P500,000.00. The 9.88 grams of shabu are hereby ordered destroyed pursuant to the provisions of Section 21(4) and (7) of RA 9165.The period of detention of the accused shall be deducted in his service of sentence.Let a commitment order be issued for the transfer of custody of the accused from the BJMP Lipa City to the National Penitentiary, Muntinlupa City.SO ORDERED.[8]Appellant filed a Notice of Appeal.[9] The Court of Appeals affirmed the conviction of appellant for the offense charged.Hence, this appeal.The Ruling of the Court of AppealsIn sustaining appellant\u2019s conviction for the offense charged, the Court of Appeals held that the testimony of PO3 Villas identifying the three plastic sachets of shabu as the same ones seized from appellant rendered insignificant appellant\u2019s allegation that PO3 Villas did not immediately put markings on the three sachets of shabu at the place of arrest. The Court of Appeals further ruled that the failure of the arresting officers to conduct a physical inventory and to take photographs of the seized items is not fatal as long as the integrity and evidentiary value of the seized items are properly preserved, as in this case.According to the Court of Appeals, the prosecution was able to prove the unbroken chain of custody of the prohibited drug from the time PO3 Villas confiscated the plastic sachets from appellant and marked them at the place of arrest, to the time PO3 Villas brought the plastic sachets to the police station and turned them over to the investigator on-duty until the time SPO1 de Castro submitted the marked plastic sachets to the Regional Crime Laboratory Office Calabarzon for laboratory examination.The IssueThe issue boils down to whether the prosecution established the identity and integrity of the confiscated illegal drug, which is the corpus delicti of the offense charged against appellant.The Ruling of the CourtWe grant the appeal.While appellant waived the presentation of evidence for his defense, he disputes the identity and integrity of the illegal drug which is the corpus delicti of the offense charged against him. Appellant maintains that the prosecution failed to prove the unbroken chain of custody of the illegal drug which gravely impairs its identity. Without the identity of the corpus delicti being sufficiently established, appellant claims that he should be acquitted.It is settled that in prosecutions for illegal sale of dangerous drug, not only must the essential elements of the offense be proved beyond reasonable doubt, but likewise the identity of the prohibited drug. The dangerous drug itself constitutes the corpus delicti of the offense and the fact of its existence is vital to a judgment of conviction.[10]Necessarily, the prosecution must establish that the substance seized from the accused is the same substance offered in court as exhibit. In this regard, the prosecution must sufficiently prove the unbroken chain of custody of the confiscated illegal drug. In People v. Watamama,[11] the Court held:In all prosecutions for the violation of the Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002, the existence of the prohibited drug has to be proved. The chain of custody rule requires that testimony be presented about every link in the chain, from the moment the item was seized up to the time it is offered in evidence. To this end, the prosecution must ensure that the substance presented in court is the same substance seized from the accused.While this Court recognizes substantial adherence to the requirements of R.A. No. 9165 and its implementing rules and regulations, not perfect adherence, is what is demanded of police officers attending to drugs cases, still, such officers must present justifiable reason for their imperfect conduct and show that the integrity and evidentiary value of the seized items had been preserved. x x x. (Emphasis supplied)In People v. Climaco,[12] citing Malillin v. People,[13] the Court held:x x x [T]o establish guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt in cases involving dangerous drugs, it is important that the substance illegally possessed in the first place be the same substance offered in court as exhibit. This chain of custody requirement ensures that unnecessary doubts are removed concerning the identity of the evidence. When the identity of the dangerous drug recovered from the accused is not the same dangerous drug presented to the forensic chemist for review and examination, nor the same dangerous drug presented to the court, the identity of the dangerous drug is not preserved due to the broken chain of custody. With this, an element in the criminal cases for illegal sale and illegal possession of dangerous drugs, the corpus delicti, is not proven, and the accused must then be acquitted based on reasonable doubt. For this reason, [the accused] must be acquitted on the ground of reasonable doubt due to the broken chain of custody over the dangerous drug allegedly recovered from him.In this case, there was a glaring gap in the custody of the illegal drug since the prosecution failed to sufficiently establish who had custody of the illegal drug from the moment it was allegedly transmitted to the Batangas Provincial Crime Laboratory on 27 May 2004 until it was allegedly delivered to the Regional Crime Laboratory on 4 June 2004. There was no evidence presented how the confiscated sachets of shabu were stored, preserved or labeled nor who had custody prior to their delivery to the Regional Crime Laboratory and their subsequent presentation before the trial court. This is evident from the testimony of PO3 Villas, who stated he had no knowledge on who had custody of the sachets of shabu from 27 May 2004 until 4 June 2004. PO3 Villas testified thus: Q But when the accused was arrested on May 27, 2004, records will show that the specimen was submitted to the crime laboratory on June 4, 2004 which is practically several days after. Am I right? A It was turned over to the duty investigator. Q Who brought the specimen to the crime laboratory? A I don\u2019t know from the duty investigator, sir. Q So you are not aware who brought the specimen to the crime laboratory? A Yes, sir. Q But between May 27 and June 4, 2004, who was in custody of the specimen? A I turned it over to the duty investigator, sir. Q On what date? A On May 27 after we turned over the suspect to the investigator, sir. Q So your statement which says that the accused was released simply because the specimen or the result of the examination \u2026 would not catch up with the investigation is not correct because you have not submitted immediately the specimen to the crime laboratory? COURT Q Because it was submitted seven (7) days after the apprehension? A I was not the one who is concerned with the submission of the specimen to the crime laboratory. We turned it over to the duty investigator and the duty investigator marked the specimen, Your Honor. ATTY. GAJITOS Q But you will agree that the specimen was submitted to the crime laboratory by your investigator only on June 4, 2004 or practically a week after the apprehension? A I don\u2019t know, sir. It is only now that I came to know, sir.[14] (Emphasis supplied) The prosecution attempted to fill the gap in the chain of custody. However, such effort proved futile. On re-direct examination, PO3 Villas, who earlier testified that he had no knowledge on who had custody of the illegal drugs prior and during their delivery to the crime laboratories, merely restated the contents of the 3 June 2004 Memorandum from the Chief of the Batangas Police addressed to the Regional Chief, corresponding to the questions of the prosecutor. In other words, PO3 Villas testified on a piece of document he had no participation in the preparation or execution thereof. PO3 Villas testified as follows: CROSS-EXAMINATION OF ATTY. GAJITOS Q Do you admit there are no significant markings on this black box for possession or identification more particularly the signature or initial of the arresting officer? A No, sir. ATTY. GAJITOS No further question, Your Honor. COURT Re-direct. PROSECUTOR Q During your cross-examination, you were asked regarding the fact as a reply to the question of the defense it was after 7 days that the specimen was actually brought to the laboratory for examination, your answer that was correct? A Yes, ma\u2019am. Q I am showing to you a document, the indorsement which came from the Office of the Chief of Police of Batangas City dated May 27, 2004, can you please go over the same and tell the Court what is the relevance of that document regarding the delivery of specimen to the crime laboratory? A This is the request prepared by our investigator dated May 27 in relation to the arrest of Gerardo Enumerable wherein the subject were three (3) plastic sachets of shabu, it was delivered to Batangas Provincial Crime Laboratory on the same date, ma\u2019am. Q How did you come to know it was delivered on the same date? A There was a stamp receipt by the Provincial Crime Laboratory office delivered by SPO1 De Castro and received by PO3 Llarena at Batangas Provincial Crime Laboratory, ma\u2019am. Q You likewise identified during the direct examination chemistry report coming from Camp Vicente Lim, how would you reconcile the fact the specimen was delivered to the Provincial Crime Laboratory and the result came from Camp Vicente Lim? A It was the Provincial Crime Laboratory of Batangas PPO who made the indorsements from Batangas Provincial Police Office to the Crime Laboratory, Camp Vicente Lim, ma\u2019am. Q Do you have proof to show that fact? A Yes, ma\u2019am. Q What is that? A Letter request made by the Batangas Crime Laboratory to the Crime Laboratory, Camp Vicente Lim, ma\u2019am. Q This is the same request made by the Batangas Provincial Crime Laboratory addressed to Regional Crime Laboratory, was there a proof to show that the specimen together with the indorsement was actually received by the Crime Laboratory Camp Vicente Lim. A Yes, there was a stamp of the Regional Crime Laboratory office delivered by PO3 Vargas and received by PO3 Macabasco of the Regional Crime Laboratory, ma\u2019am. Q What date? A It was delivered on June 3 and the specimen was received on June 4, ma\u2019am. Q Why was it necessary for your office to deliver the specimen to the Provincial Crime Laboratory, why not directly to the Crime Laboratory of Camp Vicente Lim? A During that time there was no chemist who examined the specimen in the Provincial Crime Laboratory so what they did was they delivered the specimen to the Regional Crime Laboratory, ma\u2019am. Q My question is, why not deliver it directly to Camp Vicente Lim? A The PNP during that time did not have any budget, ma\u2019am. Q How much would it need to deliver the specimen? A It was cheap, sir. The problem was that the Provincial Crime Laboratory did not have any chemist, they delivered the specimen to the Regional Crime Laboratory that is why there are many accused who remained at large, ma\u2019am. x x x x Q Who brought the specimen to the PNP Crime Laboratory? A The officer on duty, Your Honor. Q From Batangas to Camp Vicente Lim, do you know the officer? A The person who delivered there, it is stated in the document, Your Honor. Q Who was in custody of this specimen from Batangas PNP to the Provincial Crime Laboratory? A The officer, Your Honor.[15] (Emphasis supplied) Clearly, PO3 Villas had no personal knowledge on (1) how the illegal drugs were delivered and who delivered the drugs from the Batangas Provincial Crime Laboratory to the Regional Crime Laboratory; (2) who received the drugs in the Regional Crime Laboratory; and (3) who had custody of the drugs from 27 May 2004 to 3 June 2004 until their presentation before the trial court. The testimony of PO3 Villas merely attests to the existence of the Memorandum from the Chief of the Batangas Provincial Crime Laboratory to the Regional Crime Laboratory.While appellant admitted during the pre-trial the authenticity and due execution of the Chemistry Report, prepared by Police Inspector and Forensic Chemist Donna Villa P. Huelgas, this admission merely affirms the existence of the specimen and the request for laboratory examination and the results thereof. Appellant\u2019s admission does not relate to the issue of chain of custody. In fact, appellant qualified his admission that the specimens were not taken or bought from him.[16] In People v. Gutierrez, the Court stated:x x x That the defense stipulated on these matters,viz: that the specimen exists, that a request has been made by the arresting officers for examination thereof, that a forensic chemist examined it, and that it tested positive for methylamphetamine hydrochloride has no bearing on the question of chain of custody. These stipulations, which merely affirm the existence of the specimen, and the request for laboratory examination and the results thereof, were entered into during pre-trial only in order to dispense with the testimony of the forensic chemist and abbreviate the proceedings. x x x.[17]Since the failure of the prosecution to establish every link in the chain of custody of the illegal drug gravely compromised its identity and integrity, which illegal drug is the corpus delicti of the offense charged against appellant, his acquittal is therefore in order.WHEREFORE, we GRANT the appeal and ACQUIT appellant Gerardo Enumerable y De Villa based on reasonable doubt and we ORDER his immediate release from detention, unless he is detained for any other lawful cause.SO ORDERED.Velasco, Jr.,* Del Castillo, Mendoza, and Leonen, JJ., concur.* Designated Acting Member per Special Order No. 1910 dated 12 January 2015.[1] Rollo, pp. 2-15.

GERARDO ENUMERABLE Y DE VILLA, APPELLANT.\n\nD E C I S I O N\n\nCARPIO, J.:\n\nThe Case\n\nOn appeal is the 31 January 2013 Decision [1] of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CR HC No. 04948.\u00a0 The Court of Appeals affirmed the 15 February 2011 Decision [2] of the Regional Trial Court, Branch 12 of Lipa City convicting appellant Gerardo Enumerable y De Villa for violation of Section 5 of Republic Act No. 9165.\n\nThe Facts\n\nThe Information dated 27 August 2004 reads:\n\nThat on or about the 27 th day of May, 2004 at about 11:30 o\u2019clock in the morning at Petron Gasoline Station, located at B. Morada Ave., Lipa City, Philippines and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, without authority of law, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously sell, deliver, dispose or give away to a police officer-poseur buyer, 9.88 grams of Methamphetamine Hydrochloride locally known as \u201cshabu\u201d, a dangerous drug, contained in three (3) plastic sachets.\n\nContrary to Law. [3]\n\nAppellant pleaded not guilty to the offense charged. [4] Trial ensued.\n\nThe prosecution presented two witnesses, namely:\u00a0 Police Officer (PO) 3 Edwalberto Villas and Police Inspector Danilo Balmes.\u00a0 On the other hand, appellant waived the presentation of any defense evidence.\n\nAs found by the trial court, the facts are as follows:\n\nFrom the evidence adduced by the People, the Court finds that based on the information about a deal in shabu between the asset of PO3 Edwalberto Villas and a certain Gerry of San Pablo City, a buy-bust operation was conducted by the elements of the Batangas City Police Station with the assistance of Police Inspector Danilo Balmes of the CIDG Batangas Province on May 27, 2004 at 11:30 o\u2019clock in the morning at the Petron Gasoline Station along B. Morada Ave., Lipa City.\n\nUsing two (2) pieces of marked P500.00 bills and boodle money to make the appearance of about P24,000.00, the police asset who posed as a buyer transacted with the alias Gerry upon his arrival at the gas station.\u00a0 After the exchange of the marked money and the three (3) plastic sachets of shabu placed in a black plastic box, alias Gerry was placed under arrest.\u00a0 He was later identified as Gerardo Enumerable y de Villa.\u00a0 The marked money was recovered from his possession by PO3 Villas who also took custody of the specimen shabu which he marked EMV 1 to EMV 3.\u00a0 The three (3) sachets of shabu were turned over to the Batangas Provincial Crime Laboratory, pursuant to the request for laboratory examination of P/Supt. Fausto Manzanilla, Jr., Chief of Police, Batangas City PNP on May 27, 2004 at 5:25 p.m.\u00a0 However, that Crime laboratory indorsed the request with the specimens on June 4, 2004 at 2:30 p.m. to the Regional Crime Laboratory in Calamba City.\n\nPolice Inspector and Forensic Chemist Donna Villa P. Huelgas found the specimens positive for the presence of methamphetamine hydrochloride, a dangerous drug, as shown by Chemistry Report No. D-566-04, the authenticity and genuineness of which were admitted by accused during the pre-trial. [5]\nAppellant filed a Comment with Motion for Leave to File Demurrer, [6] which motion was denied by the trial court for appellant\u2019s failure to adduce any reason therefor. [7]\n\nThe trial court found appellant guilty of the offense charged.\u00a0 The dispositive portion of the trial court\u2019s decision reads:\n\nWHEREFORE, the Court finds accused GERARDO ENUMERABLE y DE VILLA guilty beyond reasonable doubt as principal by direct participation of the crime of drug pushing as defined and penalized under Section 5, Article II of Republic Act [No.] 9165 otherwise known as the Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002 and hereby impose on him the penalty of life imprisonment and to pay a fine of P500,000.00.\u00a0 The 9.88 grams of shabu are hereby ordered destroyed pursuant to the provisions of Section 21(4) and (7) of RA 9165.\n\nThe period of detention of the accused shall be deducted in his service of sentence.\n\nLet a commitment order be issued for the transfer of custody of the accused from the BJMP Lipa City to the National Penitentiary, Muntinlupa City.\n\nSO ORDERED. [8]\n\nAppellant filed a Notice of Appeal. [9] The Court of Appeals affirmed the conviction of appellant for the offense charged.\n\nHence, this appeal.\n\nThe Ruling of the Court of Appeals\nIn sustaining appellant\u2019s conviction for the offense charged, the Court of Appeals held that the testimony of PO3 Villas identifying the three plastic sachets of shabu as the same ones seized from appellant rendered insignificant appellant\u2019s allegation that PO3 Villas did not immediately put markings on the three sachets of shabu at the place of arrest.\u00a0 The Court of Appeals further ruled that the failure of the arresting officers to conduct a physical inventory and to take photographs of the seized items is not fatal as long as the integrity and evidentiary value of the seized items are properly preserved, as in this case.\n\nAccording to the Court of Appeals, the prosecution was able to prove the unbroken chain of custody of the prohibited drug from the time PO3 Villas confiscated the plastic sachets from appellant and marked them at the place of arrest, to the time PO3 Villas brought the plastic sachets to the police station and turned them over to the investigator on-duty until the time SPO1 de Castro submitted the marked plastic sachets to the Regional Crime Laboratory Office Calabarzon for laboratory examination.\n\nThe Issue\n\nThe issue boils down to whether the prosecution established the identity and integrity of the confiscated illegal drug, which is the corpus delicti of the offense charged against appellant.\n\nThe Ruling of the Court\n\nWe grant the appeal.\n\nWhile appellant waived the presentation of evidence for his defense, he disputes the identity and integrity of the illegal drug which is the corpus delicti of the offense charged against him.\u00a0 Appellant maintains that the prosecution failed to prove the unbroken chain of custody of the illegal drug which gravely impairs its identity. Without the identity of the corpus delicti being sufficiently established,\u00a0 appellant claims that he should be acquitted.\n\nIt is settled that in prosecutions for illegal sale of dangerous drug, not only must the essential elements of the offense be proved beyond reasonable doubt, but likewise the identity of the prohibited drug. The dangerous drug itself constitutes the corpus delicti of the offense and the fact of its existence is vital to a judgment of conviction. [10]\n\nNecessarily, the prosecution must establish that the substance seized from the accused is the same substance offered in court as exhibit.\u00a0 In this regard, the prosecution must sufficiently prove the unbroken chain of custody of the confiscated illegal drug.\u00a0 In People v. Watamama , [11] the Court held:\n\nIn all prosecutions for the violation of the Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002, the existence of the prohibited drug has to be proved. The chain of custody rule requires that testimony be presented about every link in the chain, from the moment the item was seized up to the time it is offered in evidence. To this end, the prosecution must ensure that the substance presented in court is the same substance seized from the accused.\n\nWhile this Court recognizes substantial adherence to the requirements of R.A. No. 9165 and its implementing rules and regulations, not perfect adherence, is what is demanded of police officers attending to drugs cases, still, such officers must present justifiable reason for their imperfect conduct and show that the integrity and evidentiary value of the seized items had been preserved. x x x. (Emphasis supplied)\nIn People v. Climaco , [12] citing Malillin v. People , [13] the Court held:\n\nx x x [T]o establish guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt in cases involving dangerous drugs, it is important that the substance illegally possessed in the first place be the same substance offered in court as exhibit.\u00a0 This chain of custody requirement ensures that unnecessary doubts are removed concerning the identity of the evidence.\u00a0 When the identity of the dangerous drug recovered from the accused is not the same dangerous drug presented to the forensic chemist for review and examination, nor the same dangerous drug presented to the court, the identity of the dangerous drug is not preserved due to the broken chain of custody.\u00a0 With this, an element in the criminal cases for illegal sale and illegal possession of dangerous drugs, the corpus delicti , is not proven, and the accused must then be acquitted based on reasonable doubt.\u00a0 For this reason, [the accused] must be acquitted on the ground of reasonable doubt due to the broken chain of custody over the dangerous drug allegedly recovered from him.\nIn this case, there was a glaring gap in the custody of the illegal drug since the prosecution failed to sufficiently establish who had custody of the illegal drug from the moment it was allegedly transmitted to the Batangas Provincial Crime Laboratory on 27 May 2004 until it was allegedly delivered to the Regional Crime Laboratory on 4 June 2004.\u00a0 There was no evidence presented how the confiscated sachets of shabu were stored, preserved or labeled nor who had custody prior to their delivery to the Regional Crime Laboratory and their subsequent presentation before the trial court.\u00a0 This is evident from the testimony of PO3 Villas, who stated he had no knowledge on who had custody of the sachets of shabu from 27 May 2004 until 4 June 2004.\u00a0 PO3 Villas testified thus:\n\n[TABLE_CONTENT]\nQ | But when the accused was arrested on May 27, 2004, records will show that the specimen was submitted to the crime laboratory on June 4, 2004 which is practically several days after.\u00a0 Am I right?\nA | It was turned over to the duty investigator.\nQ | Who brought the specimen to the crime laboratory?\nA | I don\u2019t know from the duty investigator, sir.\nQ | So you are not aware who brought the specimen to the crime laboratory?\nA | Yes, sir.\nQ | But between May 27 and June 4, 2004, who was in custody of the specimen?\nA | I turned it over to the duty investigator, sir.\nQ | On what date?\nA | On May 27 after we turned over the suspect to the investigator, sir.\nQ | So your statement which says that the accused was released simply because the specimen or the result of the examination \u2026 would not catch up with the investigation is not correct because you have not submitted immediately the specimen to the crime laboratory?\nCOURT | \nQ | Because it was submitted seven (7) days after the apprehension?\nA | I was not the one who is concerned with the submission of the specimen to the crime laboratory.\u00a0 We turned it over to the duty investigator and the duty investigator marked the specimen, Your Honor.\nATTY.

      "title": "NEIL B. AGUILAR AND RUBEN CALIMBAS, PETITIONERS, VS. LIGHTBRINGERS CREDIT COOPERATIVE, RESPONDENT.D E C I S I O N MENDOZA, J.: This is a petition for review on certiorari filed by petitioners Neil B. Aguilar (Aguilar) and Ruben Calimbas (Calimbas), seeking to reverse and set aside the April 5, 2013[1] and October 9, 2013[2] Resolutions of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. SP No. 128914, which denied the petition for review outright, assailing the January 2, 2013 Decision[3] of the Regional Trial Court, Branch 5, Dinalupihan, Bataan (RTC) and the May 9, 2012 Decision[4] of the First Municipal Circuit Trial Court, Dinalupihan, Bataan (MCTC).In the lower courts, one of the issues involved was the proper application of the rules when a party does not appear in the scheduled pre-trial conference despite due notice. In this petition, the dismissal by the CA of the petition filed under Rule 42 for failure to attach the entire records has also been put to question, aside from the veracity of indebtedness issue.The FactsThis case stemmed from the three (3) complaints for sum of money separately filed by respondent Lightbringers Credit Cooperative (respondent) on July 14, 2008 against petitioners Aguilar and Calimbas, and one Perlita Tantiangco (Tantiangco) which were consolidated before the First Municipal Circuit Trial Court, Dinalupihan, Bataan (MCTC). The complaints alleged that Tantiangco, Aguilar and Calimbas were members of the cooperative who borrowed the following funds:In Civil Case No. 1428, Tantiangco allegedly borrowed P206,315.71 as evidenced by Cash Disbursement Voucher No. 4010 but the net loan was only P45,862.00 as supported by PNB Check No. 0000005133.[5]In Civil Case No. 1429, petitioner Calimbas allegedly borrowed P202,800.18 as evidenced by Cash Disbursement Voucher No. 3962 but the net loan was only P60,024.00 as supported by PNB Check No. 0000005088;[6]In Civil Case No. 1430, petitioner Aguilar allegedly borrowed P126,849.00 as evidenced by Cash Disbursement Voucher No. 3902 but the net loan was only P76,152.00 as supported by PNB Check No. 0000005026;[7]Tantiangco, Aguilar and Calimbas filed their respective answers. They uniformly claimed that the discrepancy between the principal amount of the loan evidenced by the cash disbursement voucher and the net amount of loan reflected in the PNB checks showed that they never borrowed the amounts being collected. They also asserted that no interest could be claimed because there was no written agreement as to its imposition.On the scheduled pre-trial conference, only respondent and its counsel appeared. The MCTC then issued the Order,[8] dated August 25, 2009, allowing respondent to present evidence ex parte. Respondent later presented Fernando Manalili (Manalili), its incumbent General Manager, as its sole witness. In his testimony, Manalili explained that the discrepancy between the amounts of the loan reflected in the checks and those in the cash disbursement vouchers were due to the accumulated interests from previous outstanding obligations, withheld share capital, as well as the service and miscellaneous fees. He stated, however, that it was their bookkeeper who could best explain the details.Aguilar and Calimbas insisted that they should have the right to cross-examine the witness of respondent, notwithstanding the fact that these cases were being heard ex parte. In the interest of justice, the MCTC directed the counsels of the parties to submit their respective position papers on the issue of whether or not a party who had been declared \u201cas in default\u201d might still participate in the trial of the case. Only respondent, however, complied with the directive. In its Order,[9] dated April 27, 2011, the MCTC held that since the proceedings were being heard ex parte, the petitioners who had been declared \u201cas in default\u201d had no right to participate therein and to cross-examine the witnesses. Thereafter, respondent filed its formal offer of evidence.[10]MCTC RulingOn May 9, 2012, the MCTC resolved the consolidated cases in three separate decisions. In Civil Case No. 1428,[11] the MCTC dismissed the complaint against Tantiangco because there was no showing that she received the amount being claimed. Moreover, the PNB check was made payable to \u201ccash\u201d and was encashed by a certain Violeta Aguilar. There was, however, no evidence that she gave the proceeds to Tantiangco. Further, the dates indicated in the cash disbursement voucher and the PNB check varied from each other and suggested that the voucher could refer to a different loan.The decisions in Civil Case No. 1429[12] and 1430,[13] however, found both Calimbas and Aguilar liable to respondent for their respective debts. The PNB checks issued to the petitioners proved the existence of the loan transactions. Their receipts of the loan were proven by their signatures appearing on the dorsal portions of the checks as well as on the cash disbursement vouchers. As a matter of practice, banks would allow the encashment of checks only by the named payee and subject to the presentation of proper identification. Nonetheless, the MCTC ruled that only the amount shown in the PNB check must be awarded because respondent failed to present its bookkeeper to justify the higher amounts being claimed. The court also awarded attorney\u2019s fees in favor of respondent. The dispositive portion of the decision in Civil Case No. 1429 reads:WHEREFORE, premises considered, judgment is hereby rendered in plaintiff\u2019s favor and against the defendant, ordering the latter to pay plaintiff the amount of P60,024.00 with interest at the rate of 12% per annum from April 4, 2007 until fully paid, plus P15,000.00 as attorney\u2019s fees.Costs against the defendant.SO ORDERED.[14]And in Civil Case No. 1430, the dispositive portion states:WHEREFORE, premises considered, judgment is hereby rendered in plaintiff\u2019s favor and against the defendant, ordering the latter to pay the plaintiff the amount of ?76,152.00 with interest at the rate of 12% per annum from February 28, 2007 until fully paid.Defendant is further directed to pay attorney\u2019s fees equivalent to 25% of the adjudged amount.Costs against the defendant.SO ORDERED.[15]On July 12, 2012, a notice of appeal[16] was filed by the petitioners, and on August 15, 2012, they filed their joint memorandum for appeal[17] before the Regional Trial Court, Branch 5, Bataan (RTC). Aguilar and Calimbas argued out that had they been allowed to present evidence, they would have established that the loan documents were bogus. Respondent produced documents to appear that it had new borrowers but did not lend any amount to them. Attached to the joint memorandum were photocopies of the dorsal portions of the PNB checks which showed that these checks were to be deposited back to respondent\u2019s bank account.RTC RulingOn January 2, 2013, the RTC rendered separate decisions in Civil Case No. DH-1300-12[18] and Civil Case No. DH-1299-12[19] which affirmed the MCTC decisions. It held that the PNB checks were concrete evidence of the indebtedness of the petitioners to respondent. The RTC relied on the findings of the MCTC that the checks bore no endorsement to another person or entity. The checks were issued in the name of the petitioners and, thus, they had the right to encash the same and appropriate the proceeds. The decretal portions of the RTC decision in both cases similarly read:WHEREFORE, premises considered, the appeal is hereby DENIED. The Decision dated May 9, 2012 of the First Municipal Circuit Trial Court (1st MCTC), Dinalupihan-Hermosa, Bataan is hereby affirmed in toto.SO ORDERED.On January 18, 2013, the petitioners filed their joint motion for reconsideration/new trial[20] before the RTC. Aguilar and Calimbas reiterated their position that they did not receive the proceeds of the checks. As an alternative prayer, petitioners moved that the RTC remand the case to the MCTC for a new trial on account of the Sinumpaang Salaysay of Arcenit Dela Torre, the bookkeeper of respondent.On February 11, 2013, the RTC issued separate orders[21] denying the motion of the petitioners. It explained that all the issues were already passed upon and the supposed newly discovered evidence was already available during appeal, but the petitioners failed to present the same in time.CA RulingAggrieved, Aguilar and Calimbas filed a petition for review[22] before the CA on March 11, 2013. It was dismissed, however, in the questioned resolution,[23] dated April 5, 2013, stating that the petition was formally defective because the \u201cverification and disclaimer of forum shopping\u201d and the \u201caffidavit of service\u201d had a defective jurat for failure of the notary public to indicate his notarial commission number and office address. Moreover, the entire records of the case, inclusive of the oral and documents evidence, were not attached to the petition in contravention of Section 2, Rule 42 of the Rules of Court.A motion for reconsideration[24] was filed by the petitioners which sought the leniency of the CA. They attached a corrected verification and disclaimer of forum shopping and affidavit of service. They asked the CA to simply order the RTC to elevate the records of the case pursuant to Section 7, Rule 42 of the Rules of Court. Moreover, the petitioners could not attach the records of the case because the flooding caused by \u201cHabagat\u201d in August 2012 soaked the said records in water.In the other questioned resolution, dated October 9, 2013, the CA denied the motion because the petitioners still failed to attach the entire records of the case which was a mandatory requirement under Section 2, Rule 42.Hence, this petition.SOLE ASSIGNMENT OF ERRORTHE COURT OF APPEALS COMMITTED GRAVE ABUSE OF DISCRETION AMOUNTING TO LACK OR IN EXCESS OF JURISDICTION WHEN IT DISMISSED THE PETITION FOR REVIEW FILED BEFORE IT BY THE PETITIONERS UNDER RULE 42 OF THE RULES OF COURT CITING THAT THE SAID PETITION IS FORMALLY DEFECTIVE FOR FAILURE OF THE PETITIONERS TO SUBMIT WITH THE SAID PETITION THE ENTIRE RECORDS OF THE APPEALED CIVIL CASE NOS. DH-1300-12 AND DH-1299-12.[25]The petitioners argue that contrary to the findings of the CA, they substantially complied with the required form and contents of a petition for review under Section 2, Rule 42 of the Rules of Court. There is nothing in the provision which requires that the entire records of the appealed case should be endorsed to the CA. Such requirement would definitely be cumbersome to poor litigants like them.They assert that they submitted the following pleadings and material portions of the court records in their petition for review: (1) certified copies of the decisions, orders or resolutions of the RTC and the MCTC; (2) complaints against the petitioners attached with documents used by respondent in its formal offer of evidence; (3) answer of the petitioners; (4) order of the MCTC declaring the petitioners in default; (5) respondent\u2019s formal offer of evidence; (6) notice of appeal; (7) joint memorandum of appeal; and (8) joint motion for reconsideration/new trial. According to the petitioners, these pleadings and records were sufficient to support their petition for review.Assuming that there was a reason to dismiss the petition on account of technicalities, the petitioners argue that the CA should not have strictly applied the rules of procedure and provided leniency to the petitioners. They also ask the Court to give a glance on the merits of their case brought before the CA.On February 7, 2014, respondent filed its comment[26] contending that the petitioners had no excuse in their non-compliance with Section 2, Rule 42. They claim that the court records were not attached because these were soaked in flood water in August 2012, but the RTC rendered its decision in January 2013. The petitioners failed to secure a certification from the RTC that these records were indeed unavailable.On May 21, 2014, the petitioners filed their reply before this Court,[27] adding that the elevation of the entire records of the case was not a mandatory requirement, and the CA could exercise its discretion that it furnished with the entire records of the case by invoking Section 7, Rule 42 of the Rules of Court.The Court\u2019s RulingFirst Procedural IssueOn the sole assignment of error, the Court agrees with the petitioners that Section 2, Rule 42 does not require that the entire records of the case be attached to the petition for review. The provision states:Sec. 2. Form and contents. - The petition shall be filed in seven (7) legible copies, with the original copy intended for the court being indicated as such by the petitioner, and shall (a) state the full names of the parties to the case, without impleading the lower courts or judges thereof either as petitioners or respondents; (b) indicate the specific material dates showing that it was filed on time; (c) set forth concisely a statement of the matters involved, the issues raised, the specification of errors of fact or law, or both, allegedly committed by the Regional Trial Court, and the reasons or arguments relied upon for the allowance of the appeal; (d) be accompanied by clearly legible duplicate originals or true copies of the judgments or final orders of both lower courts, certified correct by the clerk of court of the Regional Trial Court, the requisite number of plain copies thereof and of the pleadings and other material portions of the record as would support the allegations of the petition. [Emphasis and underscoring supplied]The abovequoted provision enumerates the required documents that must be attached to a petition for review, to wit: (1) clearly legible duplicate originals or true copies of the judgments or final orders of both lower courts, certified correct by the clerk of court of the Regional Trial Court; (2) the requisite number of plain copies thereof; and (3) of the pleadings and other material portions of the record as would support the allegations of the petition. Clearly, the Rules do not require that the entire records of the case be attached to the petition for review. Only when these specified documents are not attached in the petition will it suffer infirmities under Section 3, Rule 42, which states:Sec. 3. Effect of failure to comply with requirements. - The failure of the petitioner to comply with any of the foregoing requirements regarding the payment of the docket and other lawful fees, the deposit for costs, proof of service of the petition, and the contents of and the documents which should accompany the petition shall be sufficient ground for the dismissal thereof.In Canton v. City of Cebu,[28] the Court discussed the importance of attaching the pleadings or material portions of the records to the petition for review. \u201c[P]etitioner\u2019s discretion in choosing the documents to be attached to the petition is however not unbridled. The CA has the duty to check the exercise of this discretion, to see to it that the submission of supporting documents is not merely perfunctory. The practical aspect of this duty is to enable the CA to determine at the earliest possible time the existence of prima facie merit in the petition.\u201d[29] In that case, the petition was denied because the petitioner failed to attach the complaint, answer and appeal memorandum to support their allegation.In Cusi-Hernandez v. Diaz,[30] a case where the petitioner did not attach to her petition for review a copy of the contract to sell that was at the center of controversy, the Court nonetheless found that there was a substantial compliance with the rule, considering that the petitioner had appended to the petition for review a certified copy of the decision of the MTC that contained a verbatim reproduction of the omitted contract.Recently, in Galvez, v. CA,[31] it was held that attaching the other records of the MTC and the RTC were not necessary based on the circumstances of the case. The petitioner therein was not assailing the propriety of the findings of fact by the MTC and the RTC, but only the conclusions reached by the said lower courts after their appreciation of the facts. In dealing with the questions of law, the CA could simply refer to the attached decisions of the MTC and the RTC.Thus, the question in the case at bench is whether or not the petitioners attached the sufficient pleadings and material portions of the records in their petition for review. The Court rules that the petition was in substantial compliance with the requirements.The assignment of error[32] in the petition for review clearly raises questions of fact as the petitioners assail the appreciation of evidence by the MCTC and the RTC. Thus, aside from the decisions and orders of the MCTC and the RTC, the petitioners should attach pertinent portions of the records such as the testimony of the sole witness of respondent, the copies of the cash disbursement vouchers and the PNB checks presented by respondent in the MCTC. In the petition for review, the petitioners attached respondent\u2019s complaints before the MCTC which contained the photocopies of the cash disbursement vouchers and PNB checks. These should be considered as ample compliance with Section 2, Rule 42 of the Rules of Court.Second Procedural IssueNevertheless, instead of remanding the case to the CA, this Court deems it fit to rule on the merits of the case to once and for all settle the dispute of the parties.The rule is that a court can only consider the evidence presented by respondent in the MCTC because the petitioners failed to attend the pre-trial conference on August 25, 2009 pursuant to Section 5, Rule 18 of the Rules of Court.[33] The Court, however, clarifies that failure to attend the pre-trial does not result in the \u201cdefault\u201d of the defendant. Instead, the failure of the defendant to attend shall be cause to allow the plaintiff to present his evidence ex parte and the court to render judgment on the basis thereof.The case of Philippine American Life & General Insurance Company v. Joseph Enario[34] discussed the difference between non-appearance of a defendant in a pre-trial conference and the declaration of a defendant in default in the present Rules of Civil Procedure. The decision states:Prior to the 1997 Revised Rules of Civil Procedure, the phrase \"as in default\" was initially included in Rule 20 of the old rules, and which read as follows:Sec. 2. A party who fails to appear at a pre-trial conference may be non-suited or considered as in default.It was however amended in the 1997 Revised Rules of Civil Procedure. Justice Regalado, in his book REMEDIAL LAW COMPENDIUM, explained the rationale for the deletion of the phrase \"as in default\" in the amended provision, to wit:1. This is a substantial reproduction of Section 2 of the former Rule 20 with the change that, instead of defendant being declared \"as in default\" by reason of his non-appearance, this section now spells out that the procedure will be to allow the ex parte presentation of plaintiff\u2019s evidence and the rendition of judgment on the basis thereof. While actually the procedure remains the same, the purpose is one of semantical propriety or terminological accuracy as there were criticisms on the use of the word \"default\" in the former provision since that term is identified with the failure to file a required answer, not appearance in court.If the absent party is the plaintiff, then his case shall be dismissed. If it is the defendant who fails to appear, then the plaintiff is allowed to present his evidence ex parte and the court shall render judgment on the basis thereof. Thus, the plaintiff is given the privilege to present his evidence without objection from the defendant, the likelihood being that the court will decide in favor of the plaintiff, the defendant having forfeited the opportunity to rebut or present his own evidence.[35]The pre-trial cannot be taken for granted. It is not a mere technicality in court proceedings for it serves a vital objective: the simplification, abbreviation and expedition of the trial, if not indeed its dispensation.[36] More significantly, the pre-trial has been institutionalized as the answer to the clarion call for the speedy disposition of cases. Hailed as the most important procedural innovation in Anglo-Saxon justice in the nineteenth century, it paved the way for a less cluttered trial and resolution of the case. It is, thus, mandatory for the trial court to conduct pre-trial in civil cases in order to realize the paramount objective of simplifying, abbreviating and expediting trial.[37]In the case at bench, the petitioners failed to attend the pre-trial conference set on August 25, 2009. They did not even give any excuse for their non-appearance, manifestly ignoring the importance of the pre-trial stage. Thus, the MCTC properly issued the August 25, 2009 Order,[38] allowing respondent to present evidence ex parte.The MCTC even showed leniency when it directed the counsels of the parties to submit their respective position papers on whether or not Aguilar and Calimbas could still participate in the trial of the case despite their absence in the pre-trial conference. This gave Aguilar and Calimbas a second chance to explain their non-attendance and, yet, only respondent complied with the directive to file a position paper. The MCTC, in its Order,[39] dated April 27, 2011, properly held that since the proceedings were being heard ex parte, Aguilar and Calimbas had no right to participate therein and to cross-examine the witness.Thus, as it stands, the Court can only consider the evidence on record offered by respondent. The petitioners lost their right to present their evidence during the trial and, a fortiori, on appeal due to their disregard of the mandatory attendance in the pre-trial conference.Substantive IssueAnd on the merits of the case, the Court holds that there was indeed a contract of loan between the petitioners and respondent. The Court agrees with the findings of fact of the MCTC and the RTC that a check was a sufficient evidence of a loan transaction. The findings of fact of the trial court, its calibration of the testimonies of the witnesses and its assessment of the probative weight thereof, as well as its conclusions anchored on the findings are accorded high respect, if not conclusive effect.[40]The case of Pua v. Spouses Lo Bun Tiong[41] discussed the weight of a check as an evidence of a loan:In Pacheco v. Court of Appeals, this Court has expressly recognized that a check constitutes an evidence of indebtedness and is a veritable proof of an obligation. Hence, it can be used in lieu of and for the same purpose as a promissory note. In fact, in the seminal case of Lozano v. Martinez, We pointed out that a check functions more than a promissory note since it not only contains an undertaking to pay an amount of money but is an \"order addressed to a bank and partakes of a representation that the drawer has funds on deposit against which the check is drawn, sufficient to ensure payment upon its presentation to the bank.\" This Court reiterated this rule in the relatively recent Lim v. Mindanao Wines and Liquour Galleria stating that a check, the entries of which are in writing, could prove a loan transaction.[42]There is no dispute that the signatures of the petitioners were present on both the PNB checks and the cash disbursement vouchers. The checks were also made payable to the order of the petitioners. Hence, respondent can properly demand that they pay the amounts borrowed. If the petitioners believe that there is some other bogus scheme afoot, then they must institute a separate action against the responsible personalities. Otherwise, the Court can only rule on the evidence on record in the case at bench, applying the appropriate laws and jurisprudence.As to the award of attorney\u2019s fees, the Court is of the view that the same must be removed. Attorney's fees are in the concept of actual or compensatory damages allowed under the circumstances provided for in Article 2208 of the Civil Code, and absent any evidence supporting its grant, the same must be deleted for lack of factual basis.[43] In this case, the MCTC merely stated that respondent was constrained to file the present suit on account of the petitioners\u2019 obstinate failure to settle their obligation. Without any other basis on record to support the award, such cannot be upheld in favor of respondent. The settled rule is that no premium should be placed on the right to litigate and that not every winning party is entitled to an automatic grant of attorney\u2019s fees.[44]WHEREFORE, the petition is PARTIALLY GRANTED.In accord with the discourse on the substantive issue, the January 2, 2013 decision of the Regional Trial Court, Branch 5, Dinalupihan, Bataan, is AFFIRMED. The award of attorney's fees is, however, DELETED.SO ORDERED.Carpio, (Chairperson), Velasco, Jr.,* Del Castillo, and Leonen, JJ., concur.* Designated Acting member in lieu of Associate Justice Arturo D.

AGUILAR AND RUBEN CALIMBAS, PETITIONERS, VS. LIGHTBRINGERS CREDIT COOPERATIVE, RESPONDENT.\n\nD E C I S I O N\n\nMENDOZA, J.:\n\nThis is a petition for review on certiorari filed by petitioners Neil B. Aguilar ( Aguilar ) and Ruben Calimbas ( Calimbas ), seeking to reverse and set aside the April 5, 2013 [1] and October 9, 2013 [2] Resolutions of the Court of Appeals ( CA ) in CA-G.R. SP No. 128914, which denied the petition for review outright, assailing the January 2, 2013 Decision [3] of the Regional Trial Court, Branch 5, Dinalupihan, Bataan ( RTC ) and the May 9, 2012 Decision [4] of the First Municipal Circuit Trial Court, Dinalupihan, Bataan (MCTC) .\n\nIn the lower courts, one of the issues involved was the proper application of the rules when a party does not appear in the scheduled pre-trial conference despite due notice. In this petition, the dismissal by the CA of the petition filed under Rule 42 for failure to attach the entire records has also been put to question, aside from the veracity of indebtedness issue.\n\nThe Facts\n\nThis case stemmed from the three (3) complaints for sum of money separately filed by respondent Lightbringers Credit Cooperative (respondent) on July 14, 2008 against petitioners Aguilar and Calimbas, and one Perlita Tantiangco (Tantiangco) which were consolidated before the First Municipal Circuit Trial Court, Dinalupihan, Bataan (MCTC) . The complaints alleged that Tantiangco, Aguilar and Calimbas\u00a0 were members of the cooperative who borrowed the following funds:\n\nIn Civil Case No. 1428, Tantiangco allegedly borrowed P206,315.71 as evidenced by Cash Disbursement Voucher No. 4010 but the net loan was only P45,862.00 as supported by PNB Check No. 0000005133. [5]\n\nIn Civil Case No. 1429, petitioner Calimbas allegedly borrowed P202,800.18 as evidenced by Cash Disbursement Voucher No. 3962 but the net loan was only P60,024.00 as supported by PNB Check No. 0000005088; [6]\n\nIn Civil Case No. 1430, petitioner Aguilar allegedly borrowed P126,849.00 as evidenced by Cash Disbursement Voucher No. 3902 but the net loan was only P76,152.00 as supported by PNB Check No. 0000005026; [7]\nTantiangco, Aguilar and Calimbas filed their respective answers. They uniformly claimed that the discrepancy between the principal amount of the loan evidenced by the cash disbursement voucher and the net amount of loan reflected in the PNB checks showed that they never borrowed the amounts being collected. They also asserted that no interest could be claimed because there was no written agreement as to its imposition.\n\nOn the scheduled pre-trial conference, only respondent and its counsel appeared. The MCTC then issued the Order, [8] dated August 25, 2009, allowing respondent to present evidence ex parte. Respondent later presented Fernando Manalili (Manalili) , its incumbent General Manager, as its sole witness. In his testimony, Manalili explained that the discrepancy between the amounts of the loan reflected in the checks and those in the cash disbursement vouchers were due to the accumulated interests from previous outstanding obligations, withheld share capital, as well as the service and miscellaneous fees. He stated, however, that it was their bookkeeper who could best explain the details.\n\nAguilar and Calimbas insisted that they should have the right to cross-examine the witness of respondent, notwithstanding the fact that these cases were being heard ex parte . In the interest of justice, the MCTC directed the counsels of the parties to submit their respective position papers on the issue of whether or not a party who had been declared \u201cas in default\u201d might still participate in the trial of the case. Only respondent, however, complied with the directive. In its Order, [9] dated April 27, 2011, the MCTC held that since the proceedings were being heard ex parte , the petitioners who had been declared \u201cas in default\u201d had no right to participate therein and to cross-examine the witnesses. Thereafter, respondent filed its formal offer of evidence. [10]\n\nMCTC Ruling\n\nOn May 9, 2012, the MCTC resolved the consolidated cases in three separate decisions. In Civil Case No. 1428, [11] the MCTC dismissed the complaint against Tantiangco because there was no showing that she received the amount being claimed. Moreover, the PNB check was made payable to \u201ccash\u201d and was encashed by a certain Violeta Aguilar. There was, however, no evidence that she gave the proceeds to Tantiangco. Further, the dates indicated in the cash disbursement voucher and the PNB check varied from each other and suggested that the voucher could refer to a different loan.\n\nThe decisions in Civil Case No. 1429 [12] and 1430, [13] however, found both Calimbas and Aguilar liable to respondent for their respective debts. The PNB checks issued to the petitioners proved the existence of the loan transactions. Their receipts of the loan were proven by their signatures appearing on the dorsal portions of the checks as well as on the cash disbursement vouchers. As a matter of practice, banks would allow the encashment of checks only by the named payee and subject to the presentation of proper identification. Nonetheless, the MCTC ruled that only the amount shown in the PNB check must be awarded because respondent failed to present its bookkeeper to justify the higher amounts being claimed. The court also awarded attorney\u2019s fees in favor of respondent. The dispositive portion of the decision in Civil Case No. 1429 reads:\n\nWHEREFORE, premises considered, judgment is hereby rendered in plaintiff\u2019s favor and against the defendant, ordering the latter to pay plaintiff the amount of P60,024.00 with interest at the rate of 12% per annum from April 4, 2007 until fully paid, plus P15,000.00 as attorney\u2019s fees.\n\nCosts against the defendant.\n\nSO ORDERED. [14]\n\nAnd in Civil Case No. 1430, the dispositive portion states:\n\nWHEREFORE, premises considered, judgment is hereby rendered in plaintiff\u2019s favor and against the defendant, ordering the latter to pay the plaintiff the amount of ?76,152.00 with interest at the rate of 12% per annum from February 28, 2007 until fully paid.\n\nDefendant is further directed to pay attorney\u2019s fees equivalent to 25% of the adjudged amount.\n\nCosts against the defendant.\n\nSO ORDERED. [15]\nOn July 12, 2012, a notice of appeal [16] was filed by the petitioners, and on August 15, 2012, they filed their joint memorandum for appeal [17] before the Regional Trial Court, Branch 5, Bataan (RTC) . Aguilar and Calimbas argued out that had they been allowed to present evidence, they would have established that the loan documents were bogus. Respondent produced documents to appear that it had new borrowers but did not lend any amount to them. Attached to the joint memorandum were photocopies of the dorsal portions of the PNB checks which showed that these checks were to be deposited back to respondent\u2019s bank account.\n\nRTC Ruling\n\nOn January 2, 2013, the RTC rendered separate decisions in Civil Case No. DH-1300-12 [18] and Civil Case No. DH-1299-12 [19] which affirmed the MCTC decisions. It held that the PNB checks were concrete evidence of the indebtedness of the petitioners to respondent. The RTC relied on the findings of the MCTC that the checks bore no endorsement to another person or entity. The checks were issued in the name of the petitioners and, thus, they had the right to encash the same and appropriate the proceeds. The decretal portions of the RTC decision in both cases similarly read:\n\nWHEREFORE, premises considered, the appeal is hereby DENIED. The Decision dated May 9, 2012 of the First Municipal Circuit Trial Court (1 st MCTC), Dinalupihan-Hermosa, Bataan is hereby affirmed in toto.\n\nSO ORDERED.\nOn January 18, 2013, the petitioners filed their joint motion for reconsideration/new trial [20] before the RTC. Aguilar and Calimbas reiterated their position that they did not receive the proceeds of the checks. As an alternative prayer, petitioners moved that the RTC remand the case to the MCTC for a new trial on account of the Sinumpaang Salaysay of Arcenit Dela Torre, the bookkeeper of respondent.\n\nOn February 11, 2013, the RTC issued separate orders [21] denying the motion of the petitioners. It explained that all the issues were already passed upon and the supposed newly discovered evidence was already available during appeal, but the petitioners failed to present the same in time.\n\nCA Ruling\n\nAggrieved, Aguilar and Calimbas filed a petition for review [22] before the CA on March 11, 2013. It was dismissed, however, in the questioned resolution, [23] dated April 5, 2013, stating that the petition was formally defective because the \u201cverification and disclaimer of forum shopping\u201d and the \u201caffidavit of service\u201d had a defective jurat for failure of the notary public to indicate his notarial commission number and office address. Moreover, the entire records of the case, inclusive of the oral and documents evidence, were not attached to the petition in contravention of Section 2, Rule 42 of the Rules of Court.\n\nA motion for reconsideration [24] was filed by the petitioners which sought the leniency of the CA. They attached a corrected verification and disclaimer of forum shopping and affidavit of service. They asked the CA to simply order the RTC to elevate the records of the case pursuant to Section 7, Rule 42 of the Rules of Court. Moreover, the petitioners could not attach the records of the case because the flooding caused by \u201cHabagat\u201d in August 2012 soaked the said records in water.\n\nIn the other questioned resolution, dated October 9, 2013, the CA denied the motion because the petitioners still failed to attach the entire records of the case which was a mandatory requirement under Section 2, Rule 42.\n\nHence, this petition.\n\nSOLE ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR\nTHE COURT OF APPEALS COMMITTED GRAVE ABUSE OF DISCRETION AMOUNTING TO LACK OR IN EXCESS OF JURISDICTION WHEN IT DISMISSED THE PETITION FOR REVIEW FILED BEFORE IT BY THE PETITIONERS UNDER RULE 42 OF THE RULES OF COURT CITING THAT THE SAID PETITION IS FORMALLY DEFECTIVE FOR FAILURE OF THE PETITIONERS TO SUBMIT WITH THE SAID PETITION THE ENTIRE RECORDS OF THE APPEALED CIVIL CASE NOS. DH-1300-12 AND DH-1299-12. [25]\nThe petitioners argue that contrary to the findings of the CA, they substantially complied with the required form and contents of a petition for review under Section 2, Rule 42 of the Rules of Court. There is nothing in the provision which requires that the entire records of the appealed case should be endorsed to the CA. Such requirement would definitely be cumbersome to poor litigants like them.\n\nThey assert that they submitted the following pleadings and material portions of the court records in their petition for review: (1) certified copies of the decisions, orders or resolutions of the RTC and the MCTC; (2) complaints against the petitioners attached with documents used by respondent in its formal offer of evidence; (3) answer of the petitioners;\u00a0 (4) order of the MCTC declaring the petitioners in default; (5) respondent\u2019s formal offer of evidence; (6) notice of appeal; (7) joint memorandum of appeal; and (8) joint motion for reconsideration/new trial. According to the petitioners, these pleadings and records were sufficient to support their petition for review.\n\nAssuming that there was a reason to dismiss the petition on account of technicalities, the petitioners argue that the CA should not have strictly applied the rules of procedure and provided leniency to the petitioners. They also ask the Court to give a glance on the merits of their case brought before the CA.\n\nOn February 7, 2014, respondent filed its comment [26] contending that the petitioners had no excuse in their non-compliance with Section 2, Rule 42. They claim that the court records were not attached because these were soaked in flood water in August 2012, but the RTC rendered its decision in January 2013. The petitioners failed to secure a certification from the RTC that these records were indeed unavailable.\n\nOn May 21, 2014, the petitioners filed their reply before this Court, [27] adding that the elevation of the entire records of the case was not a mandatory requirement, and the CA could exercise its discretion that it furnished with the entire records of the case by invoking Section 7, Rule 42 of the Rules of Court.\n\nThe Court\u2019s Ruling\n\nFirst Procedural Issue\n\nOn the sole assignment of error, the Court agrees with the petitioners that Section 2, Rule 42 does not require that the entire records of the case be attached to the petition for review. The provision states:\n\nSec. 2. Form and contents. - The petition shall be filed in seven (7) legible copies, with the original copy intended for the court being indicated as such by the petitioner, and shall (a) state the full names of the parties to the case, without impleading the lower courts or judges thereof either as petitioners or respondents; (b) indicate the specific material dates showing that it was filed on time; (c) set forth concisely a statement of the matters involved, the issues raised, the specification of errors of fact or law, or both, allegedly committed by the Regional Trial Court, and the reasons or arguments relied upon for the allowance of the appeal; (d) be accompanied by clearly legible duplicate originals or true copies of the judgments or final orders of both lower courts, certified correct by the clerk of court of the Regional Trial Court, the requisite number of plain copies thereof and of the pleadings and other material portions of the record as would support the allegations of the petition . [Emphasis and underscoring supplied]\nThe abovequoted provision enumerates the required documents that must be attached to a petition for review, to wit: (1) clearly legible duplicate originals or true copies of the judgments or final orders of both lower courts, certified correct by the clerk of court of the Regional Trial Court; (2) the requisite number of plain copies thereof; and (3) of the pleadings and other material portions of the record as would support the allegations of the petition. Clearly, the Rules do not require that the entire records of the case be attached to the petition for review. Only when these specified documents are not attached in the petition will it suffer infirmities under Section 3, Rule 42, which states:\n\nSec. 3. Effect of failure to comply with requirements. - The failure of the petitioner to comply with any of the foregoing requirements regarding the payment of the docket and other lawful fees, the deposit for costs, proof of service of the petition, and the contents of and the documents which should accompany the petition shall be sufficient ground for the dismissal thereof.\nIn Canton v. City of Cebu , [28] the Court discussed the importance of attaching the pleadings or material portions of the records to the petition for review. \u201c[P]etitioner\u2019s discretion in choosing the documents to be attached to the petition is however not unbridled. The CA has the duty to check the exercise of this discretion, to see to it that the submission of supporting documents is not merely perfunctory. The practical aspect of this duty is to enable the CA to determine at the earliest possible time the existence of prima facie merit in the petition.\u201d [29] In that case, the petition was denied because the petitioner failed to attach the complaint, answer and appeal memorandum to support their allegation.\n\nIn Cusi-Hernandez v. Diaz , [30] a case where the petitioner did not attach to her petition for review a copy of the contract to sell that was at the center of controversy, the Court nonetheless found that there was a substantial compliance with the rule, considering that the petitioner had appended to the petition for review a certified copy of the decision of the MTC that contained a verbatim reproduction of the omitted contract.\n\nRecently, in Galvez, v. CA , [31] it was held that attaching the other records of the MTC and the RTC were not necessary based on the circumstances of the case. The petitioner therein was not assailing the propriety of the findings of fact by the MTC and the RTC, but only the conclusions reached by the said lower courts after their appreciation of the facts. In dealing with the questions of law, the CA could simply refer to the attached decisions of the MTC and the RTC.\n\nThus, the question in the case at bench is whether or not the petitioners attached the sufficient pleadings and material portions of the records in their petition for review. The Court rules that the petition was in substantial compliance with the requirements.\n\nThe assignment of error [32] in the petition for review clearly raises questions of fact as the petitioners assail the appreciation of evidence by the MCTC and the RTC. Thus, aside from the decisions and orders of the MCTC and the RTC, the petitioners should attach pertinent portions of the records such as the testimony of the sole witness of respondent, the copies of the cash disbursement vouchers and the PNB checks presented by respondent in the MCTC. In the petition for review, the petitioners attached respondent\u2019s complaints before the MCTC which contained the photocopies of the cash disbursement vouchers and PNB checks. These should be considered as ample compliance with Section 2, Rule 42 of the Rules of Court.\n\nSecond Procedural Issue\n\nNevertheless, instead of remanding the case to the CA, this Court deems it fit to rule on the merits of the case to once and for all settle the dispute of the parties.\n\nThe rule is that a court can only consider the evidence presented by respondent in the MCTC because the petitioners failed to attend the pre-trial conference on August 25, 2009 pursuant to Section 5, Rule 18 of the Rules of Court. [33] The Court, however, clarifies that failure to attend the pre-trial does not result in the \u201cdefault\u201d of the defendant. Instead, the failure of the defendant to attend shall be cause to allow the plaintiff to present his evidence ex parte and the court to render judgment on the basis thereof.\n\nThe case of Philippine American Life & General Insurance Company v. Joseph Enario [34] discussed the difference between non-appearance of a defendant in a pre-trial conference and the declaration of a defendant in default in the present Rules of Civil Procedure. The decision states:\n\nPrior to the 1997 Revised Rules of Civil Procedure, the phrase \"as in default\" was initially included in Rule 20 of the old rules, and which read as follows:\nSec. 2. A party who fails to appear at a pre-trial conference may be non-suited or considered as in default.\nIt was however amended in the 1997 Revised Rules of Civil Procedure. Justice Regalado, in his book REMEDIAL LAW COMPENDIUM, explained the rationale for the deletion of the phrase \"as in default\" in the amended provision, to wit:\n1. This is a substantial reproduction of Section 2 of the former Rule 20 with the change that, instead of defendant being declared \"as in default\" by reason of his non-appearance, this section now spells out that the procedure will be to allow the ex parte presentation of plaintiff\u2019s evidence and the rendition of judgment on the basis thereof. While actually the procedure remains the same, the purpose is one of semantical propriety or terminological accuracy as there were criticisms on the use of the word \"default\" in the former provision since that term is identified with the failure to file a required answer, not appearance in court.\nIf the absent party is the plaintiff, then his case shall be dismissed. If it is the defendant who fails to appear, then the plaintiff is allowed to present his evidence ex parte and the court shall render judgment on the basis thereof. Thus, the plaintiff is given the privilege to present his evidence without objection from the defendant, the likelihood being that the court will decide in favor of the plaintiff, the defendant having forfeited the opportunity to rebut or present his own evidence. [35]\n\nThe pre-trial cannot be taken for granted. It is not a mere technicality in court proceedings for it serves a vital objective: the simplification, abbreviation and expedition of the trial, if not indeed its dispensation. [36] More significantly, the pre-trial has been institutionalized as the answer to the clarion call for the speedy disposition of cases. Hailed as the most important procedural innovation in Anglo-Saxon justice in the nineteenth century, it paved the way for a less cluttered trial and resolution of the case. It is, thus, mandatory for the trial court to conduct pre-trial in civil cases in order to realize the paramount objective of simplifying, abbreviating and expediting trial. [37]\n\nIn the case at bench, the petitioners failed to attend the pre-trial conference set on August 25, 2009. They did not even give any excuse for their non-appearance, manifestly ignoring the importance of the pre-trial stage. Thus, the MCTC properly issued the August 25, 2009 Order, [38] allowing respondent to present evidence ex parte .\n\nThe MCTC even showed leniency when it directed the counsels of the parties to submit their respective position papers on whether or not Aguilar and Calimbas could still participate in the trial of the case despite their absence in the pre-trial conference. This gave Aguilar and Calimbas a second chance to explain their non-attendance and, yet, only respondent complied with the directive to file a position paper. The MCTC, in its Order, [39] dated April 27, 2011, properly held that since the proceedings were being heard ex parte , Aguilar and Calimbas had no right to participate therein and to cross-examine the witness.\n\nThus, as it stands, the Court can only consider the evidence on record offered by respondent. The petitioners lost their right to present their evidence during the trial and, a fortiori , on appeal due to their disregard of the mandatory attendance in the pre-trial conference.\n\nSubstantive Issue\n\nAnd on the merits of the case, the Court holds that there was indeed a contract of loan between the petitioners and respondent. The Court agrees with the findings of fact of the MCTC and the RTC that a check was a sufficient evidence of a loan transaction. The findings of fact of the trial court, its calibration of the testimonies of the witnesses and its assessment of the probative weight thereof, as well as its conclusions anchored on the findings are accorded high respect, if not conclusive effect. [40]\n\nThe case of Pua v. Spouses Lo Bun Tiong [41] discussed the weight of a check as an evidence of a loan:\n\nIn Pacheco v. Court of Appeals , this Court has expressly recognized that a check constitutes an evidence of indebtedness and is a veritable proof of an obligation. Hence, it can be used in lieu of and for the same purpose as a promissory note. In fact, in the seminal case of Lozano v. Martinez , We pointed out that a check functions more than a promissory note since it not only contains an undertaking to pay an amount of money but is an \"order addressed to a bank and partakes of a representation that the drawer has funds on deposit against which the check is drawn, sufficient to ensure payment upon its presentation to the bank.\" This Court reiterated this rule in the relatively recent Lim v. Mindanao Wines and Liquour Galleria stating that a check, the entries of which are in writing, could prove a loan transaction. [42]\n\nThere is no dispute that the signatures of the petitioners were present on both the PNB checks and the cash disbursement vouchers. The checks were also made payable to the order of the petitioners. Hence, respondent can properly demand that they pay the amounts borrowed. If the petitioners believe that there is some other bogus scheme afoot, then they must institute a separate action against the responsible personalities.\u00a0 Otherwise, the Court can only rule on the evidence on record in the case at bench, applying the appropriate laws and jurisprudence.\n\nAs to the award of attorney\u2019s fees, the Court is of the view that the same must be removed. Attorney's fees are in the concept of actual or compensatory damages allowed under the circumstances provided for in Article 2208 of the Civil Code, and absent any evidence supporting its grant, the same must be deleted for lack of factual basis. [43] In this case, the MCTC merely stated that respondent was constrained to file the present suit on account of the petitioners\u2019 obstinate failure to settle their obligation. Without any other basis on record to support the award, such cannot be upheld in favor of respondent. The settled rule is that no premium should be placed on the right to litigate and that not every winning party is entitled to an automatic grant of attorney\u2019s fees. [44]\n\nWHEREFORE , the petition is PARTIALLY GRANTED.\n\nIn accord with the discourse on the substantive issue, the January 2, 2013 decision of the Regional Trial Court, Branch 5, Dinalupihan, Bataan, is AFFIRMED . The award of attorney's fees is, however, DELETED.\n\nSO ORDERED.\n\nCarpio, (Chairperson), Velasco, Jr., * Del Castillo , and Leonen, JJ., concur.\n\n* Designated Acting member in lieu of Associate Justice Arturo D.

DOMICIANO F. VILLAHERMOSA, SR., COMPLAINANT, VS. ATTY. ISIDRO L. CARACOL, RESPONDENT.R E S O L U T I O N\nDR. DOMICIANO F. VILLAHERMOSA, SR., COMPLAINANT, VS. ATTY. ISIDRO L. CARACOL, RESPONDENT.\n\nR E S O L U T I O N\n\nVILLARAMA, JR., J.:\n\nBefore us is a complaint [1] for disbarment filed by Dr. Domiciano F. Villahermosa, Sr., against Atty. Isidro L. Caracol for deceit, gross misconduct and violation of oath under Section 27, [2] Rule 138 of the Rules of Court.\n\nVillahermosa is respondent in two land cases [3] involving cancellation of emancipation patents and transfer certificates of title, cancellation of special power of attorney and deeds of absolute sale and recovery of ownership and possession of parcels of land derived from Original Certificate of Title (OCT) No. 433 which covered 23.3018 hectares of land in Valencia, Bukidnon. Counsel on record for plaintiff was Atty. Fidel Aquino.\n\nOCT No. 433 was a homestead patent granted to Micael Babela who had two sons, Fernando and Efren.\u00a0 As legal heirs of Micael, Fernando received 53,298 square meters while Efren received 33,296 square meters. Subsequently, Transfer Certificates of Title (TCTs) were issued in their respective names.\n\nWhen the agrarian reform law [4] was enacted on October 21, 1972, emancipation patents and titles were issued to Hermogena and Danilo Nipotnipot, beneficiaries of the program, who in turn sold the parcels of land to complainant\u2019s spouse, Raymunda Villahermosa.\u00a0 A deed of absolute sale was executed in favor of Raymunda.\n\nOn March 2, 1994, the Department of Agrarian Reform Adjudication Board (DARAB) issued a decision ordering the cancellation of the emancipation patents and TCTs derived from OCT No. 433 stating that it was not covered by the agrarian reform law.\u00a0 This decision was appealed to and affirmed by the DARAB Central Board and the Court of Appeals.\n\nOn September 25, 2002, Atty. Caracol, as \u201cAdd\u2019l Counsel for the Plaintiffs-Movant,\u201d filed a motion for execution with the DARAB, Malaybalay, Bukidnon praying for the full implementation of the March 2, 1994 decision. [5]\n\nOn December 20, 2005, Atty. Caracol filed a Motion for Issuance of Second Alias Writ of Execution and Demolition [6] which he signed as \u201cCounsel for the Plaintiff Efren Babela\u201d [7] .\n\nVillahermosa filed this complaint [8] alleging that Atty. Caracol had no authority to file the motions since he obtained no authority from the plaintiffs and the counsel of record. Villahermosa posited that Efren could not have authorized Atty. Caracol to file the second motion because Efren had already been dead [9] for more than a year.\u00a0 He claimed that Atty. Caracol\u2019s real client was a certain Ernesto I. Aguirre, who had allegedly bought the same parcel of land. Villahermosa presented affidavits of Efren\u2019s widow [10] and daughter [11] both stating that Efren never executed a waiver of rights and that the parcel of land was sold to Villahermosa through a deed of sale.\u00a0 Both also stated that they were familiar with Efren\u2019s signature.\u00a0 They state that the signature in the waiver was different from his usual signature. Villahermosa averred that Atty. Caracol committed deceit and gross misconduct.\n\nIn addition, Villahermosa claimed that Atty. Caracol introduced falsified and manufactured evidence into the proceedings.\u00a0 Atty. Caracol, in introducing a document denominated as Waiver of Rights where Efren waived all his rights in favor of Ernesto Aguirre, was able to secure the execution of the judgment in one of the cases [12] in favor of Ernesto Aguirre. Villahermosa also filed a case [13] for falsification of public document and use of falsified document against Ernesto Aguirre and Atty. Caracol. [14]\n\nAtty. Caracol insists that Efren and Ernesto authorized him to appear as \u201cadditional counsel\u201d.\u00a0 He said that he had consulted Atty. Aquino who advised him to go ahead with the filing.\u00a0 Moreover, he stated that he was not aware that there was a waiver of rights executed in Ernesto Aguirre\u2019s favor.\n\nIn its Report and Recommendation, [15] the Integrated Bar of the Philippines Commission on Bar Discipline (IBP CBD) found that Atty. Caracol committed deceitful acts and misconduct.\u00a0 It found that respondent did not present credible evidence to controvert the allegation that he was not authorized by plaintiff or counsel of record.\u00a0 Respondent admitted that at the time of the filing of the second motion, Efren was dead.\u00a0 It noted that Atty. Caracol did not explain how he obtained the authority nor did he present any proof of the authority.\u00a0 However, there was insufficient evidence to hold him liable for falsification.\n\nThe IBP CBD stated that Atty. Caracol clearly misled and misrepresented to the DARAB, Region X that he was counsel of Efren to protect the interest of Ernesto Aguirre, his real client, violating his oath as a lawyer.\u00a0 It thus recommended that Atty. Caracol be suspended from the practice of law for a period of five years.\n\nThe IBP Board of Governors adopted the report and recommendation but modified the penalty to one year suspension from the practice of law. [16] Atty. Caracol moved for reconsideration [17] but was denied. [18]\n\nAtty. Caracol filed a notice of appeal [19] which this Court returned to him since no legal fees are required in administrative cases. [20]\n\nWe adopt the findings of the IBP.\n\nThe Rules of Court under Rule 138, Section 21 provides for a presumption of a lawyer\u2019s appearance on behalf of his client, hence:\n\nSEC. 21. Authority of attorney to appear. \u2013 An attorney is presumed to be properly authorized to represent any cause in which he appears , and no written power of attorney is required to authorize him to appear in court for his client, but the presiding judge may, on motion of either party and on reasonable grounds therefor being shown, require any attorney who assumes the right to appear in a case to produce or prove the authority under which he appears, and to disclose, whenever pertinent to any issue, the name of the person who employed him, and may thereupon make such order as justice requires.\u00a0 An attorney willfully appearing in court for a person without being employed, unless by leave of the court, may be punished for contempt as an officer of the court who has misbehaved in his official transactions. (Emphases supplied)\nIn Land Bank of the Philippines v. Pamintuan Dev\u2019t. Co., [21] this Court said that while a lawyer is not required to present proof of his representation, when a court requires that he show such authorization, it is imperative that he show his authority to act.\u00a0 Thus:\n\nA lawyer is not even required to present a written authorization from the client. In fact, the absence of a formal notice of entry of appearance will not invalidate the acts performed by the counsel in his client\u2019s name. However, [a] court, on its own initiative or on motion of the other party may require a lawyer to adduce authorization from the client. [22]\n\nLawyers must be mindful that an attorney has no power to act as counsel for a person without being retained nor may he appear in court without being employed unless by leave of court. [23] If an attorney appears on a client\u2019s behalf without a retainer or the requisite authority neither the litigant whom he purports to represent nor the adverse party may be bound or affected by his appearance unless the purported client ratifies or is estopped to deny his assumed authority. [24] If a lawyer corruptly or willfully appears as an attorney for a party to a case without authority, he may be disciplined or punished for contempt as an officer of the court who has misbehaved in his official transaction. [25]\n\nWe must also take into consideration that even if a lawyer is retained by a client, an attorney-client relationship terminates upon death of either client or the lawyer. [26]\n\nHere, Atty. Caracol was presumed to have authority when he appeared in the proceedings before the DARAB.\u00a0 The records are unclear at what point his authority to appear for Efren was questioned.\u00a0 Neither is there any indication that Villahermosa in fact questioned his authority during the course of the proceedings.\n\nHowever, Atty. Caracol knew that Efren had already passed away at the time he filed the Motion for Issuance of Second Alias Writ of Execution and Demolition.\u00a0 As an honest, prudent and conscientious lawyer, he should have informed the Court of his client\u2019s passing and presented authority that he was retained by the client\u2019s successors-in-interest and thus the parties may have been substituted. [27]\n\nWe also note the separate opinion of Justice Isagani Cruz in People v. Mendoza [28] where he stated:\n\nI am bothered by the improvident plea of guilty made by accused Juan Magalop, presumably upon the advice of his counsel, Atty. Isidro L. Caracol of the CLAO (now the PAO).\u00a0 It would seem that this lawyer was less than conscientious when he advised his indigent client to admit a crime the man did no[t] commit.\u00a0 As the ponencia observes, \u201coutside of his improvident plea of guilt, there is absolutely no evidence against him \u2013 presented or forthcoming.\u00a0 From the evidence of the prosecution, there is no way by which Magalop could have been implicated.\u201d\n\nIt seems to me that if any one is guilty in this case, it is the PAO lawyer who, through an incredible lack of zeal in the discharge of his duties, was apparently willing, without any moral compunctions at all, and without proof, to consign an innocent man to prison.\n\nThe PAO is supposed to defend the accused, not to condemn them without cause. The defense counsel in this case did not seem to appreciate this responsibility when he prodded Magalop to plead guilty and waived the right to submit evidence in his behalf. [29]\nWhile this observation does not serve to exacerbate Atty. Caracol\u2019s liability under the present circumstances, we would like to highlight the important role of an attorney in our judicial system.\u00a0 Because of the particular nature of an attorney\u2019s function it is essential that they should act with fairness, honesty and candor towards the courts and his clients. [30] Under Rule 10.01 of the Code of Professional Responsibility:\n\nA lawyer shall not do any falsehood, nor consent to the doing of any in Court; nor shall he mislead, or allow the Court to be misled by any artifice.\n\nThis flows out from the lawyer\u2019s oath which each lawyer solemnly swears to uphold the law and court processes in the pursuit of justice.\u00a0 Thus, a lawyer must be more circumspect in his demeanor and attitude towards the public in general as agents of the judicial system.\n\nHere, Atty. Caracol, as observed by the IBP CBD, has been less than candid about his representation. We also observe that he has used underhanded means to attain his purpose.\u00a0 Atty. Caracol\u2019s blatant disregard of his duties as a lawyer cannot be countenanced.\u00a0 In view of his actions of contravening his lawyer\u2019s oath and in violation of Canons 8 and 10 and Rule 10.01 of the Code of Professional Responsibility we deem it proper to suspend him from the practice of law for a period of one year.\n\nWHEREFORE , we find respondent Atty. Isidro L. Caracol GUILTY .\u00a0 Accordingly, we SUSPEND respondent Atty. Isidro L. Caracol from the practice of law for ONE YEAR effective upon finality of this Resolution, with a warning that a repetition of the same or similar act in the future will be dealt with more severely.\n\nLet copies of this Resolution be furnished the Office of the Bar Confidant to be appended to respondent\u2019s personal record as an attorney, the Integrated Bar of the Philippines, the Department of Justice, and all courts in the country for their information and guidance.\n\nSO ORDERED.\n\nVelasco, Jr., (Chairperson), Peralta, Reyes, and Jardeleza, JJ., concur.\n\nFebruary 4, 2015\n\nN O T I C E OF J U D G M E N T\n\nSirs/Mesdames:\n\nPlease take notice that on ___ January 21, 2015 ___ a Decision, copy attached herewith, was rendered by the Supreme Court in the above-entitled case, the original of which was received by this Office on February 4, 2015 at 10:35 a.m.\n\nVery truly yours,\n(SGD)\nWILFREDO V.

DALIOAN, RESPONDENTS.DECISION VILLARAMA, JR., J.: At bar is a petition[1] for review on certiorari of the Decision[2] dated June 22, 2010 and the Resolution[3] dated August 11, 2010 of the Court of Appeals (CA) in the consolidated petitions docketed as CA-G.R. SP No. 107029 and CA-G.R. SP No. 107316, which affirmed the assailed Resolutions[4] of the National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC). The NLRC Resolutions dismissed the appeal filed by petitioner Antonio M. Magtalas (Magtalas) and Philippine School of Business Administration (PSBA), et al. in NLRC NCR Case No. 00-04-03133-06 for failure to perfect such appeal under Sections 4 and 6 of the NLRC Rules of Procedure.Petitioner Magtalas is the Certified Public Accountant (CPA) Review Director of the CPA Review Center of the Philippine School of Business Administration-Manila (PSBA-Manila). He was impleaded in this case in his official capacity.[5]PSBA is a corporation duly organized and existing under Philippine laws. It is engaged in business as an educational institution and offers review classes to candidates for the CPA Licensure Examinations.[6]Respondents Isidoro A. Ante, Raul C. Addatu, Nicanor B. Padilla, Jr., Dante Y. Ce\u00f1ido and Rhamir C. Dalioan were engaged by PSBA-Manila as professional reviewers at its CPA Review Center and were paid on an hourly basis. However, for the school year 2005-2006, they were not given any review load.[7] Respondents then sent a letter to the President of PSBA-Manila, Jose F. Peralta (Peralta), requesting for the payment of termination or retirement benefits for failure of PSBA-Manila to give them review load for the said school year. Petitioner and Peralta sent respondents individual replies stating that they were not entitled to retirement or termination benefits because they do not have an employer-employee relationship, but a professional-client relationship.[8]Consequently, respondents filed a complaint for constructive illegal dismissal, non-payment of overtime pay, holiday pay, premium for holiday pay, vacation and sick leave pay, 13th month pay, separation pay and retirement benefits, as well as for moral, exemplary, actual, nominal and temperate damages and attorney\u2019s fees[9] against PSBA-Manila, Peralta and herein petitioner with the Labor Arbitration Branch of the NLRC.In a Decision[10] dated October 9, 2007, Labor Arbiter Fe Superiaso-Cellan found petitioner, PSBA-Manila and the other persons named in the complaint liable for illegal dismissal. Finding that respondents are regular employees of PSBA-Manila, the Labor Arbiter ordered PSBA-Manila, Peralta and petitioner to pay respondents back wages, separation pay and other benefits and damages.In a Memorandum on Appeal[11] dated November 9, 2007, petitioner Magtalas alone filed with the NLRC a separate appeal with a simultaneous Motion to Reduce Bond.[12] Petitioner deposited only P100,000.00 as cash bond, with motion to reduce bond due to his incapacity of posting either a cash bond equivalent to the monetary award to respondents amounting to around P10,250,000.00 or the P600,000.00 premium of a surety bond for such amount.PSBA-Manila and Peralta, on the other hand, separately posted a cash bond of P50,000.00 with Motion to Reduce Bond.In the assailed Resolution dated June 25, 2008, the NLRC jointly resolved and dismissed the separate appeals of petitioner Magtalas on one hand, and PSBA-Manila and Peralta on the other, on the ground of non-perfection. It held that the cash bonds posted by the separate appeals of petitioner, as well as PSBA-Manila and Peralta, were not reasonable amounts, and did not interrupt the running of the period to perfect an appeal. The NLRC ruled, viz.:WHEREFORE, premises considered, the appeals are DISMISSED for non-perfection. The assailed decision dated October 09, 2007 is hereby AFFIRMED and rendered FINAL and EXECUTORY. The motions to reduce bond are DENIED for lack of merit.SO ORDERED.[13]Petitioner moved for reconsideration,[14] but the motion was denied in a Resolution dated November 25, 2008 for lack of merit, viz.:WHEREFORE, in light of the foregoing, the Motion for Reconsideration is hereby DENIED for lack of merit. No further Motions shall be entertained.SO ORDERED.[15]Petitioner then filed a Petition for Certiorari[16] \u2013 separately from PSBA-Manila and Peralta \u2013 with the CA. The petition filed by Magtalas was docketed as CA-G.R. SP No. 107316, while PSBA-Manila and Peralta\u2019s petition was docketed as CA-G.R. SP No. 107029. Herein respondents subsequently moved to consolidate the petitions. The appellate court granted the motion.In the assailed Decision promulgated on June 22, 2010, the CA affirmed the ruling of the NLRC and dismissed the consolidated petitions, viz.:WHEREFORE, finding no grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction on the part of public respondent National Labor Relations Commission, Sixth Division, the assailed Resolutions dated June 25, 2008 and November 25, 2008 issued in NLRC LAC No. 12-003259-07, which dismissed the appeal filed by petitioners in NLRC NCR Case No. 00-04-03133-06 for failure to perfect the same pursuant to Sections 4 and 6 of the NLRC Rules of Procedure, are hereby AFFIRMED. The consolidated petitions for certiorari docketed as CA-G.R. SP No. 107029 and CA-G.R. SP No. 107316 are hereby DISMISSED.SO ORDERED.[17]Petitioner Magtalas sought reconsideration in a motion[18] dated July 15, 2010, but the motion was denied by the appellate court in its Resolution dated August 11, 2010, viz.:WHEREFORE, the instant Motions for Reconsideration are DENIED for lack of merit.SO ORDERED.[19]Petitioner Magtalas seeks recourse to this Court via the instant petition for review filed on October 8, 2010 and assigned this docket number. The instant petition assails the dismissal of his appeal by the NLRC due to his failure to post a sufficient bond. Petitioner also reiterates his argument that he is not covered by the rule of the NLRC on appeal bonds because he was not the employer of respondents. He also questions the findings of the NLRC that respondents were regular employees of PSBA-Manila and that they were illegally dismissed.PSBA-Manila and Peralta, for their part, separately filed an appeal from the same CA decision with this Court. The petitions were docketed as G.R. Nos. 193438 and 194184 which were raffled off to the Second Division. The instant petition, however, was not consolidated with these two cases under the Second Division.During the pendency of the three petitions, a Release, Waiver, and Quitclaim[20] was executed before Labor Arbiter Cellan under docket numbers NLRC LAC No. 12-003259-07 and RAB CASE No. 00-04-03133-06. It was dated and stamp received by the Office of the Labor Arbiter, NLRC-NCR on March 23, 2011. The Release, Waiver, and Quitclaim states, viz.:We, complainants Isidoro A. Ante, Raul C.

FE S. CELLANNOTARY PUBLICLABOR ARBITERIn view of the execution of the above Release, Waiver, and Quitclaim and the Addendum (to Release, Waiver and Quitclaim) on March 23, 2011, PSBA-Manila and Peralta filed a Manifestation with Motion to Dismiss[22] on April 14, 2011. They moved for the dismissal of the petitions docketed under G.R. Nos. 193438 and 194184 due to the execution of these documents.On June 8, 2011, the Court, acting through the Third Division, issued a Resolution granting the Manifestation with Motion to Dismiss, viz.:Let this case be considered CLOSED and TERMINATED and the parties be INFORMED accordingly.[23]Despite the issuance by the Third Division of the June 8, 2011 Resolution which declared G.R. Nos. 193438 and 194184 closed and terminated, the Court\u2019s First Division issued a Resolution dated August 15, 2011 directing the First Division Clerk of Court to study whether the case at bar \u2013 docketed as G.R. No. 193451 \u2013 should be consolidated with G.R. Nos. 193438 and 194184, and to make a Report thereon within ten days from receipt of notice.[24] It was the First Division that issued the August 15, 2011 Resolution as this case was transferred from the Third to the First Division in a June 29, 2011 Resolution of this Court.[25]In a Memorandum Report[26] dated August 24, 2011, the Acting Assistant Division Clerk of Court of the First Division made the following recommendation:Both G.R. Nos. 193451 and 193438/194184 arose from the same antecedent facts. They also involve essentially the same parties, interrelated issues and similar subject matter.However, x x x G.R. Nos. 193438/194184 were already closed and terminated. Hence, the consolidation of G.R. No. 193451 with G.R. Nos. 193438/194184 is no longer proper or necessary and will serve no useful purpose.Accordingly, it is respectfully recommended that G.R. No. 193451 be not consolidated with G.R. Nos. 193438/194184.[27]The instant case is a separate appeal filed by petitioner Magtalas seeking recourse from the appellate court\u2019s Decision over an appeal originating from the same complaint[28] filed by herein respondents against PSBA-Manila, Peralta and petitioner himself with the Labor Arbitration Branch of the NLRC under the consolidated cases of G.R. Nos. 193438 and 194184. While the instant petition was not consolidated with G.R. Nos. 193438 and 194184 \u2013 either on motion of both parties or by this Court motu proprio \u2013 a perusal of the Release, Waiver, and Quitclaim and the Addendum (to Release, Waiver and Quitclaim) executed on March 23, 2011 between the same parties has clearly operated to fully and finally settle all of herein respondents\u2019 claims for remuneration, wages and/or benefits of whatever nature from the PSBA, its directors, officers, agents and/or employees from any and all claims, demands, causes of action and/or liability of whatever nature arising out of respondents\u2019 employment with them. The Addendum further stated that \u201cx x x no further claim, suit or proceeding of whatever nature may be filed in court or agency of the government against said Philippine School of Business Administration, Inc. \u2013 Quezon City or any person acting in their interest.\u201d[29]In the case at bar, petitioner Magtalas was impleaded in the original complaint in his official capacity as then Review Director of the CPA Review Center of PSBA-Manila. The Release, Waiver, and Quitclaim and the Addendum (to Release, Waiver and Quitclaim) with the negotiated amount of Nine Million Philippine Pesos (PHP 9,000,000.00) was signed by all five of the respondents in this case as full and final settlement of all of their claims for remuneration, wages and/or benefits of whatever nature from PSBA and its directors, officers, agents and/or employees \u2013 clearly including herein petitioner. The Release, Waiver, and Quitclaim and the Addendum (to Release, Waiver and Quitclaim) executed on March 23, 2011 has now therefore rendered this case moot and academic. To be sure, not one of the respondents herein has assailed the validity and enforceability of the two documents executed on March 23, 2011 \u2013 either in this petition or in the consolidated cases of G.R. Nos. 193438 and 194184. None of the respondents also filed any opposition when PSBA-Manila and Peralta filed a Manifestation with Motion to Dismiss on April 14, 2011 for the dismissal of the consolidated petitions docketed under G.R. Nos. 193438 and 194184 in view of the execution of both documents pertaining to the release, waiver and quitclaim. Further, there was no opposition from respondents when the Third Division of the Court issued a Resolution on June 8, 2011 granting such motion to dismiss.WHEREFORE, in view of the foregoing considerations and the Resolution issued by the Court on June 8, 2011 which considered the consolidated cases under G.R. Nos. 193438 and 194184 closed and terminated, the present petition is DENIED on the ground of mootness.No pronouncement as to costs.SO ORDERED.Velasco, Jr., (Chairperson), Peralta, Reyes, and Jardeleza, JJ., concur.[1] Rollo, pp. 9-40.[2] Id. at 42-55.

DALIOAN, RESPONDENTS.DECISION\nANTONIO M. MAGTALAS, PETITIONER, VS. ISIDORO A. ANTE, RAUL C. ADDATU, NICANOR B. PADILLA, JR., DANTE Y. CE\u00d1IDO, AND RHAMIR C. DALIOAN, RESPONDENTS.\n\nDECISION\n\nVILLARAMA, JR., J.:\n\nAt bar is a petition [1] for review on certiorari of the Decision [2] dated June 22, 2010 and the Resolution [3] dated August 11, 2010 of the Court of Appeals (CA) in the consolidated petitions docketed as CA-G.R. SP No. 107029 and CA-G.R. SP No. 107316, which affirmed the assailed Resolutions [4] of the National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC). The NLRC Resolutions dismissed the appeal filed by petitioner Antonio M. Magtalas (Magtalas) and Philippine School of Business Administration (PSBA), et al. in NLRC NCR Case No. 00-04-03133-06 for failure to perfect such appeal under Sections 4 and 6 of the NLRC Rules of Procedure.\n\nPetitioner Magtalas is the Certified Public Accountant (CPA) Review Director of the CPA Review Center of the Philippine School of Business Administration-Manila (PSBA-Manila). He was impleaded in this case in his official capacity. [5]\n\nPSBA is a corporation duly organized and existing under Philippine laws. It is engaged in business as an educational institution and offers review classes to candidates for the CPA Licensure Examinations. [6]\n\nRespondents Isidoro A. Ante, Raul C. Addatu, Nicanor B. Padilla, Jr., Dante Y. Ce\u00f1ido and Rhamir C. Dalioan were engaged by PSBA-Manila as professional reviewers at its CPA Review Center and were paid on an hourly basis. However, for the school year 2005-2006, they were not given any review load. [7] Respondents then sent a letter to the President of PSBA-Manila, Jose F. Peralta (Peralta), requesting for the payment of termination or retirement benefits for failure of PSBA-Manila to give them review load for the said school year. Petitioner and Peralta sent respondents individual replies stating that they were not entitled to retirement or termination benefits because they do not have an employer-employee relationship, but a professional-client relationship. [8]\n\nConsequently, respondents filed a complaint for constructive illegal dismissal, non-payment of overtime pay, holiday pay, premium for holiday pay, vacation and sick leave pay, 13 th month pay, separation pay and retirement benefits, as well as for moral, exemplary, actual, nominal and temperate damages and attorney\u2019s fees [9] against PSBA-Manila, Peralta and herein petitioner with the Labor Arbitration Branch of the NLRC.\n\nIn a Decision [10] dated October 9, 2007, Labor Arbiter Fe Superiaso-Cellan found petitioner, PSBA-Manila and the other persons named in the complaint liable for illegal dismissal. Finding that respondents are regular employees of PSBA-Manila, the Labor Arbiter ordered PSBA-Manila, Peralta and petitioner to pay respondents back wages, separation pay and other benefits and damages.\n\nIn a Memorandum on Appeal [11] dated November 9, 2007, petitioner Magtalas alone filed with the NLRC a separate appeal with a simultaneous Motion to Reduce Bond. [12] Petitioner deposited only P100,000.00 as cash bond, with motion to reduce bond due to his incapacity of posting either a cash bond equivalent to the monetary award to respondents amounting to around P10,250,000.00 or the P600,000.00 premium of a surety bond for such amount.\n\nPSBA-Manila and Peralta, on the other hand, separately posted a cash bond of P50,000.00 with Motion to Reduce Bond.\n\nIn the assailed Resolution dated June 25, 2008, the NLRC jointly resolved and dismissed the separate appeals of petitioner Magtalas on one hand, and PSBA-Manila and Peralta on the other, on the ground of non-perfection. It held that the cash bonds posted by the separate appeals of petitioner, as well as PSBA-Manila and Peralta, were not reasonable amounts, and did not interrupt the running of the period to perfect an appeal. The NLRC ruled, viz .:\nWHEREFORE, premises considered, the appeals are DISMISSED for non-perfection. The assailed decision dated October 09, 2007 is hereby AFFIRMED and rendered FINAL and EXECUTORY. The motions to reduce bond are DENIED for lack of merit.\n\nSO ORDERED. [13]\nPetitioner moved for reconsideration, [14] but the motion was denied in a Resolution dated November 25, 2008 for lack of merit, viz .:\nWHEREFORE, in light of the foregoing, the Motion for Reconsideration is hereby DENIED for lack of merit. No further Motions shall be entertained.\n\nSO ORDERED. [15]\nPetitioner then filed a Petition for Certiorari [16] \u2013 separately from PSBA-Manila and Peralta \u2013 with the CA. The petition filed by Magtalas was docketed as CA-G.R. SP No. 107316, while PSBA-Manila and Peralta\u2019s petition was docketed as CA-G.R. SP No. 107029. Herein respondents subsequently moved to consolidate the petitions. The appellate court granted the motion.\n\nIn the assailed Decision promulgated on June 22, 2010, the CA affirmed the ruling of the NLRC and dismissed the consolidated petitions, viz .:\nWHEREFORE, finding no grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction on the part of public respondent National Labor Relations Commission, Sixth Division, the assailed Resolutions dated June 25, 2008 and November 25, 2008 issued in NLRC LAC No. 12-003259-07, which dismissed the appeal filed by petitioners in NLRC NCR Case No. 00-04-03133-06 for failure to perfect the same pursuant to Sections 4 and 6 of the NLRC Rules of Procedure, are hereby AFFIRMED . The consolidated petitions for certiorari docketed as CA-G.R. SP No. 107029 and CA-G.R. SP No. 107316 are hereby DISMISSED .\n\nSO ORDERED. [17]\nPetitioner Magtalas sought reconsideration in a motion [18] dated July 15, 2010, but the motion was denied by the appellate court in its Resolution dated August 11, 2010, viz .:\nWHEREFORE, the instant Motions for Reconsideration are DENIED for lack of merit.\n\nSO ORDERED. [19]\nPetitioner Magtalas seeks recourse to this Court via the instant petition for review filed on October 8, 2010 and assigned this docket number. The instant petition assails the dismissal of his appeal by the NLRC due to his failure to post a sufficient bond. Petitioner also reiterates his argument that he is not covered by the rule of the NLRC on appeal bonds because he was not the employer of respondents. He also questions the findings of the NLRC that respondents were regular employees of PSBA-Manila and that they were illegally dismissed.\n\nPSBA-Manila and Peralta, for their part, separately filed an appeal from the same CA decision with this Court. The petitions were docketed as G.R. Nos. 193438 and 194184 which were raffled off to the Second Division. The instant petition, however, was not consolidated with these two cases under the Second Division.\n\nDuring the pendency of the three petitions, a Release, Waiver, and Quitclaim [20] was executed before Labor Arbiter Cellan under docket numbers NLRC LAC No. 12-003259-07 and RAB CASE No. 00-04-03133-06. It was dated and stamp received by the Office of the Labor Arbiter, NLRC-NCR on March 23, 2011. The Release, Waiver, and Quitclaim states, viz .:\nWe, complainants Isidoro A. Ante, Raul C.

CELLAN\nNOTARY PUBLIC\nLABOR ARBITER\nIn view of the execution of the above Release, Waiver, and Quitclaim and the Addendum (to Release, Waiver and Quitclaim) on March 23, 2011, PSBA-Manila and Peralta filed a Manifestation with Motion to Dismiss [22] on April 14, 2011. They moved for the dismissal of the petitions docketed under G.R. Nos. 193438 and 194184 due to the execution of these documents.\n\nOn June 8, 2011, the Court, acting through the Third Division, issued a Resolution granting the Manifestation with Motion to Dismiss, viz .:\nLet this case be considered CLOSED and TERMINATED and the parties be INFORMED accordingly. [23]\nDespite the issuance by the Third Division of the June 8, 2011 Resolution which declared G.R. Nos. 193438 and 194184 closed and terminated, the Court\u2019s First Division issued a Resolution dated August 15, 2011 directing the First Division Clerk of Court to study whether the case at bar \u2013 docketed as G.R. No. 193451 \u2013 should be consolidated with G.R. Nos. 193438 and 194184, and to make a Report thereon within ten days from receipt of notice. [24] It was the First Division that issued the August 15, 2011 Resolution as this case was transferred from the Third to the First Division in a June 29, 2011 Resolution of this Court. [25]\n\nIn a Memorandum Report [26] dated August 24, 2011, the Acting Assistant Division Clerk of Court of the First Division made the following recommendation:\nBoth G.R.

Nos. 193438/194184. [27]\nThe instant case is a separate appeal filed by petitioner Magtalas seeking recourse from the appellate court\u2019s Decision over an appeal originating from the same complaint [28] filed by herein respondents against PSBA-Manila, Peralta and petitioner himself with the Labor Arbitration Branch of the NLRC under the consolidated cases of G.R. Nos. 193438 and 194184. While the instant petition was not consolidated with G.R. Nos. 193438 and 194184 \u2013 either on motion of both parties or by this Court motu proprio \u2013 a perusal of the Release, Waiver, and Quitclaim and the Addendum (to Release, Waiver and Quitclaim) executed on March 23, 2011 between the same parties has clearly operated to fully and finally settle all of herein respondents\u2019 claims for remuneration, wages and/or benefits of whatever nature from the PSBA, its directors, officers, agents and/or employees from any and all claims, demands, causes of action and/or liability of whatever nature arising out of respondents\u2019 employment with them. The Addendum further stated that \u201cx x x no further claim, suit or proceeding of whatever nature may be filed in court or agency of the government against said Philippine School of Business Administration, Inc. \u2013 Quezon City or any person acting in their interest.\u201d [29]\n\nIn the case at bar, petitioner Magtalas was impleaded in the original complaint in his official capacity as then Review Director of the CPA Review Center of PSBA-Manila. The Release, Waiver, and Quitclaim and the Addendum (to Release, Waiver and Quitclaim) with the negotiated amount of Nine Million Philippine Pesos (PHP 9,000,000.00) was signed by all five of the respondents in this case as full and final settlement of all of their claims for remuneration, wages and/or benefits of whatever nature from PSBA and its directors, officers, agents and/or employees \u2013 clearly including herein petitioner. The Release, Waiver, and Quitclaim and the Addendum (to Release, Waiver and Quitclaim) executed on March 23, 2011 has now therefore rendered this case moot and academic. To be sure, not one of the respondents herein has assailed the validity and enforceability of the two documents executed on March 23, 2011 \u2013 either in this petition or in the consolidated cases of G.R. Nos. 193438 and 194184. None of the respondents also filed any opposition when PSBA-Manila and Peralta filed a Manifestation with Motion to Dismiss on April 14, 2011 for the dismissal of the consolidated petitions docketed under G.R. Nos. 193438 and 194184 in view of the execution of both documents pertaining to the release, waiver and quitclaim. Further, there was no opposition from respondents when the Third Division of the Court issued a Resolution on June 8, 2011 granting such motion to dismiss.\n\nWHEREFORE, in view of the foregoing considerations and the Resolution issued by the Court on June 8, 2011 which considered the consolidated cases under G.R. Nos. 193438 and 194184 closed and terminated, the present petition is DENIED on the ground of mootness.\n\nNo pronouncement as to costs.\n\nSO ORDERED.\n\nVelasco, Jr., (Chairperson), Peralta, Reyes , and Jardeleza, JJ. , concur.\n\n[1] Rollo , pp. 9-40.\n\n[2] Id. at 42-55.

      "title": "UNICOL MANAGEMENT SERVICES, INC., LINK MARINE PTE. LTD. AND/OR VICTORIANO B. TIROL, III, PETITIONERS, VS. DELIA MALIPOT, IN BEHALF OF GLICERIO MALIPOT, RESPONDENT.D E C I S I O N PERALTA, J.: This is a Petition for Review on Certiorari under Rule 45 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure seeking the reversal of the Decision[1] dated October 29, 2012 and Resolution[2] dated March 27, 2013 of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. SP No. 118451, which set aside the Decision[3] dated September 30, 2010 and Resolution[4] dated December 30, 2010 of the National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC) denying the award of death benefits to respondent.The factual antecedents follow.Respondent Delia Malipot is the surviving spouse of the deceased seaman Glicerio Malipot (seaman Glicerio) with whom the latter has two minor children.On July 16, 2008, seaman Glicerio was processed for hiring by petitioner Unicol Management Services (petitioner Unicol), acting for and in behalf of its principal, petitioner Link Marine Pte. Ltd. (petitioner Link Marine) for the vessel Heredia Sea as Chief Engineer Officer with a monthly salary of $2,500.00 for a contract duration of four (4) months.Prior to his employment, seaman Glicerio was made to undergo a rigorous pre-employment medical examination conducted by petitioners\u2019 designated physicians and was found fit to work physically and mentally.On August 18, 2008, seaman Glicerio left the Philippines to join the vessel Heredia Sea.In her complaint, respondent alleged that seaman Glicerio suffered emotional strain when petitioners refused to allow him to go home and be with his family. As early as November 16, 2008, seaman Glicerio already manifested his desire to end his contract and gave petitioners enough time to secure his replacement. His request was relayed by the Master of Heredia Sea to petitioners\u2019 Port Captain. However, the Port Captain did not allow seaman Glicerio to leave the vessel. The Port Captain also allegedly threatened seaman Glicerio by telling him that once he leaves and sets his feet on Philippine soil, he will immediately be arrested and will never be employed by any vessel ever again, and he will be made to pay for all the expenses of his deployment.Respondent further contended that seaman Glicerio became depressed, especially when December came and he was still not allowed to go home. Seaman Glicerio called up and texted respondent, begging her to talk to the Port Captain and allow him to go home. He soon became ill and experienced chest pains and palpitations. He was seen by a physician at the Fujairah Port Medical Center in Fujairah, United Arab Emirates and was diagnosed with Muscoskeletal pain and Emotional trauma/illness. Despite this, seaman Glicerio was not repatriated. Even when his 4-month contract expired on December 18, 2008, he was still not allowed to join his family for Christmas. Respondent stressed that his death was compensable because his emotional trauma was caused by the conditions of his job and aggravated by the acts of the Port Captain.For their part, petitioners alleged that seaman Glicerio was hired for the first time by petitioner Unicol and seconded to one of its principals, petitioner Link Marine to board the vessel Heredia Sea. This employment was contained in the Contract of Employment approved by the Philippine Overseas Employment Administration (POEA). The period of employment, as stipulated in said contract, was for a period of four to six months starting August 18, 2008 and ending February 18, 2009.Regrettably, before the end of his employment contract, or on January 13, 2009, petitioners received information that seaman Glicerio committed suicide by hanging in the store room of the Heredia Sea. This report was confirmed by the Certification of the Philippine Consulate General at Dubai, and the accompanying documents, namely: Medico Legal Report issued by the Ministry of Justice of the United Arab Emirates and the Death Certificate issued by the Ministry of Health of the United Arab Emirates.As a result of the foregoing events, respondent filed a Complaint before the Labor Arbiter claiming death compensation under seaman Glicerio\u2019s POEA contract.On September 14, 2009, the Labor Arbiter rendered a Decision[5] awarding death compensation in the amount of US$71,500.00.The Labor Arbiter ruled that petitioners failed to satisfactorily prove by substantial evidence that seaman Glicerio committed suicide as it relied on the inconclusive report of the medico-legal consultant, which merely gave the cause of death. The Labor Arbiter held as follows:[Respondent] Delia Malipot, in behalf of her deceased husband seaman Glicerio, is therefore entitled to death benefits and burial expenses pursuant to Section 20 (A) (1) and (4c) of the POEA Standard Employment Contract, which provide:1. In case of work-related death of the seafarer during the term of his contract, the employer shall pay his beneficiaries the Philippine currency equivalent to the amount of Fifty Thousand US Dollars (US$50,000) and an additional amount of Seven Thousand US Dollars (US$7,000) to each child under the age of twenty-one (21) but not exceeding four (4) children, at the exchange rate prevailing during the time of payment.xxx xxx xxx4. The other liabilities of the employer when the seafarer dies as a result of injury or illness during the term of employment are as follows:xxx xxx xxxc. The employer shall pay the beneficiaries of the seafarer the Philippine currency equivalent to the amount of One Thousand US Dollars (US$1,000) for burial expenses at the exchange rate prevailing during the time of payment.There is no dispute that seaman Glicerio had two (2) legitimate minor children who, in addition to the death benefits of US$50,000.00, are entitled to US$7,000 each, plus burial allowance of US$1,000.00.There is merit in [respondent]\u2019s claim that she is entitled to attorney\u2019s fees because she was forced to litigate and incur expenses to protect her rights and interests because of the unjust, unfair and totally unlawful acts of the [petitioners] in refusing to pay her claims. The same finds ample basis on Art. 2208, par. 2 of the Civil Code, which provides:Art. 2208. In the absence of stipulation, attorney\u2019s fees and expenses of litigation, other than judicial costs, cannot be recovered, except:xxx xxx xxx(2) When the defendant\u2019s act or omission has compelled the plaintiff to litigate with third persons or to incur expenses to protect his interests;WHEREFORE, premises considered, judgment is hereby rendered holding the above-named [petitioners] Unicol Maritime Services, Inc. and Victoriano B. Tirol III liable, jointly and severally, to pay [respondent] the following amounts:1.US$50,000-Death Benefits2.US$14,000-Death benefits for the two (2) minor children3.US$1,000-Burial Expenses US$65,000-Total4.US$6,500-10% Attorney\u2019s fees US$71,500.00-Grand Totalor in Philippine currency at the prevailing rate of exchange at the time of actual payment.All other claims are dismissed.SO ORDERED.[6]On October 7, 2009, petitioners appealed before the NLRC.On September 30, 2010, the NLRC reversed and set aside the decision of the Labor Arbiter and dismissed respondent\u2019s complaint for lack of merit.It its Decision, the NLRC ruled that petitioners have clearly shown that seaman Glicerio\u2019s death was due to suicide and that the same is not compensable under the POEA Employment Contract. Thus:As such, there being no evidence to the contrary, We find that Glicerio Malipot in fact committed suicide. The Labor Arbiter thus seriously erred in ruling that there is no certainty as to the cause of Glicerio\u2019s death when the above documents clearly provided otherwise. In the same Great Southern Maritime case, the Supreme Court noted:Indeed, we are not unaware of our ruling in Becmen Service Exporter and Promotion, Inc. v. Cuaresma, where we held that Jasmin Cuaresma, also an overseas Filipino worker, did not commit suicide; that Filipinos are resilient people, willing to take on sacrifices for the good of their family; and that we do not easily succumb to hardships and difficulties. Nevertheless, the circumstances prevailing in said case are totally different from this case. In Becmen, the postmortem examination and the police report did not state with specificity that poisoning or suicide was the cause of Jasmin\u2018s death. In fact, both reports mentioned that the cause of death of Jasmin was still under investigation. In contrast, the postmortem examination and the police report in this case, categorically mentioned that Salvador died of asphyxia due to hanging. It was also shown that no other individual could have caused the death of Salvador because the bathroom door was locked or bolted from the inside and could not be opened from the outside.x x x xAs such, herein [respondent] is not entitled to any death benefits nor to attorney\u2019s fees.WHEREFORE, the appealed Decision is hereby REVERSED and SET ASIDE. Another one entered DISMISSING the instant complaint for lack of merit.SO ORDERED.[7]Respondent filed a Motion for Reconsideration. However, the same was denied and the dismissal of the claim for death benefits was affirmed by the NLRC in a Resolution dated December 30, 2010.Accordingly, respondent filed a certiorari petition before the CA alleging that the NLRC committed grave abuse of discretion when it gave weight to the Medico-Legal Report issued by Dr. Osman Abdul Hameed Awad and the Death Certificate issued by the United Arab Emirates Ministry of Health as the same are inconclusive as to the cause of seaman Glicerio\u2019s death.In its Decision dated October 29, 2012, the CA reversed the NLRC ruling and awarded death benefits holding that petitioners failed to prove the cause or circumstances which lead to seaman Glicerio\u2019s suicide, viz.:Apart from the Medico-Legal Report and Death Certificate, there is no showing that [petitioners] exerted effort to ascertain the circumstances surrounding Glicerio\u2019s death which was their duty to undertake as employer. As held by the Labor Arbiter, the Medico-Legal Report and Death Certificate are only evidence of the cause of death, but not of the circumstances surrounding Glicerio\u2019s death. While [petitioners] submitted an Investigation Report, log book extracts, and Master\u2019s Report, these were belatedly submitted on appeal to the NLRC via a Supplemental Memorandum of Appeal, yet, there is no indication that these are newly discovered evidence. Worse, a reading of these documents does not show the actual circumstances which surrounded Glicerio\u2019s death, for even the Investigation Report merely stated: \u201cThe local Fujairah Police is presently carrying out an investigation into the likely cause of death.\u201d[Petitioners] presented these reports to highlight Glicerio\u2019s supposed \u201cfamily problems\u201d which allegedly drove him to commit suicide. However, this supposition is contradicted by Glicerio\u2019s yearning to go home, as related to his wife during their conversations. Also, [petitioners] alleged that Glicerio\u2019s Contract of Employment was supposed to end on February 18, 2009 as his contract was for 4-6 months. In contrast though, Glicerio\u2019s Seabased Overseas Filipino Worker (OFW) sheet stated that his contract duration is for \u201c4 months, 0 days,\u201d so his contract should have ended on December 18, 2008. But whether it was in December or in February that Glicerio was slated to go home, We cannot subscribe to the idea that he decided to commit suicide at a time that was already so near the end of his contract. It is beyond human comprehension that a seaman who wanted to go home so badly would simply take his life for no reason at all.x x x xWe also note that Delia executed a Quitclaim and Release in consideration of the sum of Twelve Thousand Two Hundred Fifty-Four and 00/100 (Usd 12,254.00) US Dollars. But it has already been held that where it is shown that the person making the waiver did so voluntarily and with full understanding of what he is doing and the consideration of the quitclaim is credible, the transaction must be recognized as a valid and binding undertaking. But where the consideration for the quitclaim is inordinately low and exceedingly unreasonable, the quitclaim cannot be considered as an obstacle to the pursuit of legitimate claims. Noting that the consideration of the quitclaim, US$12,254.00, is inordinately low compared to the US$71,500.00 awarded by the Labor Arbiter, We find it, therefore, to be palpably inequitable. However, to avoid any unjust enrichment here, the amount received by Delia must be deducted from the monetary award.WHEREFORE, premises considered, the instant petition is GRANTED. The assailed September 30, 2010 Decision and December 30, 2010 Resolution are SET ASIDE. The September 14, 2009 Decision of the Labor Arbiter is REINSTATED with MODIFICATION in that the amount of US$12,254.00 which Delia received from [petitioners] is hereby ordered deducted from the award of US$71,500.00 with interest at the rate of 6% per annum from September 14, 2009, the date of the Labor Arbiter\u2019s judgment, until the finality of this decision, and thereafter at the rate of 12% per annum until full payment.SO ORDERED.[8]Petitioners filed a Motion for Reconsideration against said Decision, but the same proved futile as it was denied by the CA in a Resolution[9] dated March 27, 2013.Hence, the present petition wherein petitioners present the following issues for our resolution:THE RECORDS OF THIS CASE IS REPLETE WITH OVERWHELMING EVIDENCE THAT SEAFARER GLICERIO MALIPOT COMMITTED SUICIDE, YET THE COURT OF APPEALS DEATH BENEFITS RULING (sic) THAT \u201cTHERE IS NO SHOWING THAT HEREIN PETITIONERS EXERTED EFFORTS TO ASCERTAIN THE CIRCUMSTANCES SURROUNDING GLICERIO\u2019S DEATH.\u201dIS DEATH BY SUICIDE COMPENSABLE UNDER THE POEA CONTRACT?[10]In essence, the main issue for resolution is whether seaman Glicerio committed suicide during the term of his employment contract which would exempt petitioners from paying the death compensation benefits to his beneficiaries.Petitioners insist that seaman Glicerio committed suicide. They aver that the CA erred in not considering the Medico-Legal Report[11] as well as the Death Certificate[12] submitted by the parties on the ground that the same are only evidence of the cause of death, but not the circumstances surrounding seaman Glicerio\u2019s suicide. Petitioners also lament the fact that the CA did not consider the Investigation Report,[13] log book extracts,[14] and Master\u2019s Report[15] which detailed the events that transpired before seaman Glicerio committed suicide. They contend that the CA erred in disregarding these pieces of evidence which convincingly rule out suspicions of foul play.The petition is impressed with merit.At the outset, it must be emphasized that the jurisdiction of the Court in cases brought before it under Rule 45[16] of the Rules of Court is limited only to reviewing errors of law. However, this rule is subject to certain exceptions, namely:(1) When the findings are grounded entirely on speculations, surmises or conjectures;(2) When the inference made is manifestly mistaken, absurd or impossible;(3) When there is grave abuse of discretion;(4) When the judgment is based on misapprehension of facts;(5)When the findings of fact are conflicting;[17](6) When in making its findings the Court of Appeals went beyond the issues of the case, or its findings are contrary to the admissions of both the appellant and the appellee;(7) When the findings are contrary to that of the trial court;(8) When the findings are conclusions without citation of specific evidence on which they are based;(9) When the facts set forth in the petition as well as in the petitioner\u2019s main and reply briefs are not disputed by the respondent;(10) When the findings of fact are premised on the supposed absence of evidence and contradicted by the evidence on record; or(11) When the Court of Appeals manifestly overlooked certain relevant facts not disputed by the parties, which, if properly considered, would justify a different conclusion.[18]Normally, the Supreme Court is not a trier of facts. However, since the findings of the CA and the NLRC were conflicting, it is incumbent upon this Court to wade through the records to find out if there was enough basis for the CA\u2019s reversal of the NLRC decision.In this case, the CA ruled out the commission by seaman Glicerio of suicide on the ground that the evidence presented by petitioners, such as the Medico-Legal Report and Death Certificate, did not state the circumstances regarding the cause of seaman Glicerio\u2019s death. Also, the CA held that the Investigation Report, log book extracts, and Master\u2019s Report were submitted for the first time on appeal to the NLRC, and thus, should not have been admitted by the NLRC.First, this Court would like to underline the fact that the NLRC may receive evidence submitted for the first time on appeal on the ground that it may ascertain facts objectively and speedily without regard to technicalities of law in the interest of substantial justice.In Sasan, Sr. v. National Labor Relations Commission 4th Division,[19] We held that our jurisprudence is replete with cases allowing the NLRC to admit evidence, not presented before the Labor Arbiter, and submitted to the NLRC for the first time on appeal. The submission of additional evidence before the NLRC is not prohibited by its New Rules of Procedure considering that rules of evidence prevailing in courts of law or equity are not controlling in labor cases. The NLRC and Labor Arbiters are directed to use every and all reasonable means to ascertain the facts in each case speedily and objectively, without regard to technicalities of law and procedure all in the interest of substantial justice. In keeping with this directive, it has been held that the NLRC may consider evidence, such as documents and affidavits, submitted by the parties for the first time on appeal.[20]Moreover, among the powers of the Commission as provided in Section 218 of the Labor Code is that the Commission may issue subpoenas requiring the attendance and testimony of witnesses or the production of such books, papers, contracts, records, statement of accounts, agreements, and others.[21] In addition, the Commission may, among other things, conduct investigation for the determination of a question, matter or controversy within its jurisdiction, proceed to hear and determine the disputes in the absence of any party thereto who has been summoned or served with notice to appear, conduct its proceedings or any part thereof in public or in private, adjourn its hearings to any time and place, refer technical matters or accounts to an expert and to accept his report as evidence after hearing of the parties upon due notice.[22] From the foregoing, it can be inferred that the NLRC can receive evidence on cases appealed before the Commission, otherwise, its factual conclusions would not have been given great respect, much weight, and relevance[23] when an adverse party assails the decision of the NLRC via petition for certiorari under Rule 65 of the Rules of Court before the CA and then to this Court via a petition for review under Rule 45.[24]Accordingly, if we take into consideration the Investigation Report, log book extracts and Master\u2019s Report submitted by petitioners, the same all strongly point out that seaman Glicerio died because he committed suicide.Contrary to the findings of the CA, it appears that the Investigation Report submitted by Inchcape Shipping Services completely detailed the events that happened prior to seaman Glicerio\u2019s death, i.e., from the last person who corresponded with him when he was still alive, the circumstances leading to the day he was discovered dead, to the person who discovered him dead. Based on the investigation, it appears that seaman Glicerio was cheerful during the first two months. However, he, thereafter, kept to himself after telling people that his family is facing problems in the Philippines and that he already informed petitioners to look for his replacement.The result of the above investigations is even bolstered by the Medical Report[25] issued by Dr. Sajeed Aboobaker who diagnosed seaman Glicerio with musculoskeletal pain and emotional trauma due to family problems, when the latter complained of chest pains and palpitations on December 10, 2008.Second, both the Medico-Legal Report and Death Certificate indicate that the actual cause of death of seaman Glicerio is \u201csuicidal asphyxia due to hanging.\u201dThe Medico-Legal Report issued by the United Arab Emirates, Ministry of Justice states:Medico-Legal Report on Case No. 2/2009/CasualtiesIn accordance with the letter of the Director of Fujairah Public Prosecution dated 09.07.2006 to carry out the external examination on the remains of Mr. Glicerio Ramirez [M]alipot, Filipino national, to show the reason of death and how death occurred, I, Prof. Dr. Osman Abdul Hameed Awad, medico-legal senior consultant in Fujairah, hereby certify that I carried out the external examination on the aforementioned body on 15.01.2009 at Fujairah Hospital Postmortem. I also reviewed the minutes of investigations. Moreover, I hereby decide the following:A) External Examination:The body is for a man aging about 56 years, in a saprophytic state because of being in the refrigerator along with blood precipitation in the upper and lower limbs. I noticed a deep lacerated groove transverse in the front of the neck and upper the level of the thyroid gristle with 2 cm width, going up and to the two sides of the neck and disappears beneath the ear along with the emergence of the tongue outside the mouth. I did not notice any recent injuries in the body.B) Opinion:Based on the above, I decide the following:1) Based on the external examination of the body of the aforementioned deceased a deep lacerated groove round the neck. It (sic) vital and recent. It occurs as a result of pressure and hanging with an elastic body such as a rope or similar.2) The death is due to suicidal Asphyxia due to hanging.3) The time of death synchronizes with the given date.[26]From the foregoing, it can be inferred that there was no foul play regarding seaman Glicerio\u2019s suicide considering that an external examination of his body shows no violence or resistance or any external injuries. In fact, the post-mortem examination conclusively established that the true cause of death was suicidal asphyxia due to hanging.All told, taking the Medico-Legal Report and the Death Certificate, together with the Investigation Report, log book extracts, and Master\u2019s Report, we find that petitioners were able to substantially prove that seaman Glicerio\u2019s death was attributable to his deliberate act of killing himself by committing suicide.With that settled, we now resolve the issue of whether respondent is entitled to death compensation benefits under the POEA Standard Employment Contract.Section 20 of the POEA \u201cStandard Terms and Conditions Governing the Overseas Employment of Filipino Seafarers On-Board Ocean-Going Ships,\u201d provides:SECTION 20. COMPENSATION AND BENEFITSA. COMPENSATION AND BENEFITS FOR INJURY OR ILLNESSx x x xB. COMPENSATION AND BENEFITS FOR DEATHIn case of work-related death of the seafarer, during the term of his contract, the employer shall pay his beneficiaries the Philippine currency equivalent to the amount of Fifty Thousand US dollars (US$50,000) and an additional amount of Seven Thousand US dollars (US$7,000) to each child under the age of twenty-one (21) but not exceeding four (4) children, at the exchange rate prevailing at the time of payment.x x x x D. No compensation and benefits shall be payable in respect of any injury, incapacity, disability or death of the seafarer resulting from his willful or criminal act or intentional breach of his duties, provided however, that the employer can prove that such injury, incapacity, disability or death is directly attributable to the seafarer.[27]Clearly, the employer is liable to pay the heirs of the deceased seafarer for death benefits once it is established that he died during the effectivity of his employment contract. However, the employer may be exempt from liability if it can successfully prove that the seaman\u2019s death was caused by an injury directly attributable to his deliberate or willful act.[28] Thus, since petitioners were able to substantially prove that seaman Glicerio\u2019s death is directly attributable to his deliberate act of hanging himself, his death, therefore, is not compensable and his heirs not entitled to any compensation or benefits.Finally, although this Court commiserates with the respondent, absent substantial evidence from which reasonable basis for the grant of benefits prayed for can be drawn, we are left with no choice but to deny her petition, lest an injustice be caused to the employer. While it is true that labor contracts are impressed with public interest and the provisions of the POEA Employment Contract must be construed logically and liberally in favor of Filipino seamen in the pursuit of their employment on board ocean-going vessels, still the rule is that justice is in every case for the deserving, to be dispensed with in the light of established facts, the applicable law, and existing jurisprudence.[29]WHEREFORE, premises considered, the instant petition is GRANTED. The Decision dated October 29, 2012 and Resolution dated March 27, 2013 of the Court of Appeals are hereby REVERSED and SET ASIDE. The Decision dated September 30, 2010 and Resolution dated December 30, 2010 of the National Labor Relations Commission are REINSTATED.SO ORDERED.Velasco, Jr., (Chairperson), Villarama, Jr., Reyes, and Jardeleza, JJ., concur.[1] Penned by Associate Justice Vicente S.E.

DELIA MALIPOT, IN BEHALF OF GLICERIO MALIPOT, RESPONDENT.\n\nD E C I S I O N\n\nPERALTA, J.:\n\nThis is a Petition for Review on Certiorari under Rule 45 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure seeking the reversal of the Decision [1] dated October 29, 2012 and Resolution [2] dated March 27, 2013 of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. SP No. 118451, which set aside the Decision [3] dated September 30, 2010 and Resolution [4] dated December 30, 2010 of the National Labor Relations Commission ( NLRC ) denying the award of death benefits to respondent.\n\nThe factual antecedents follow.\n\nRespondent Delia Malipot is the surviving spouse of the deceased seaman Glicerio Malipot ( seaman Glicerio ) with whom the latter has two minor children.\n\nOn July 16, 2008, seaman Glicerio was processed for hiring by petitioner Unicol Management Services ( petitioner Unicol ), acting for and in behalf of its principal, petitioner Link Marine Pte. Ltd. ( petitioner Link Marine ) for the vessel Heredia Sea as Chief Engineer Officer with a monthly salary of $2,500.00 for a contract duration of four (4) months.\n\nPrior to his employment, seaman Glicerio was made to undergo a rigorous pre-employment medical examination conducted by petitioners\u2019 designated physicians and was found fit to work physically and mentally.\n\nOn August 18, 2008, seaman Glicerio left the Philippines to join the vessel Heredia Sea.\n\nIn her complaint, respondent alleged that seaman Glicerio suffered emotional strain when petitioners refused to allow him to go home and be with his family. As early as November 16, 2008, seaman Glicerio already manifested his desire to end his contract and gave petitioners enough time to secure his replacement. His request was relayed by the Master of Heredia Sea to petitioners\u2019 Port Captain. However, the Port Captain did not allow seaman Glicerio to leave the vessel. The Port Captain also allegedly threatened seaman Glicerio by telling him that once he leaves and sets his feet on Philippine soil, he will immediately be arrested and will never be employed by any vessel ever again, and he will be made to pay for all the expenses of his deployment.\n\nRespondent further contended that seaman Glicerio became depressed, especially when December came and he was still not allowed to go home. Seaman Glicerio called up and texted respondent, begging her to talk to the Port Captain and allow him to go home. He soon became ill and experienced chest pains and palpitations. He was seen by a physician at the Fujairah Port Medical Center in Fujairah, United Arab Emirates and was diagnosed with Muscoskeletal pain and Emotional trauma/illness. Despite this, seaman Glicerio was not repatriated. Even when his 4-month contract expired on December 18, 2008, he was still not allowed to join his family for Christmas. Respondent stressed that his death was compensable because his emotional trauma was caused by the conditions of his job and aggravated by the acts of the Port Captain.\n\nFor their part, petitioners alleged that seaman Glicerio was hired for the first time by petitioner Unicol and seconded to one of its principals, petitioner Link Marine to board the vessel Heredia Sea. This employment was contained in the Contract of Employment approved by the Philippine Overseas Employment Administration ( POEA ). The period of employment, as stipulated in said contract, was for a period of four to six months starting August 18, 2008 and ending February 18, 2009.\n\nRegrettably, before the end of his employment contract, or on January 13, 2009, petitioners received information that seaman Glicerio committed suicide by hanging in the store room of the Heredia Sea. This report was confirmed by the Certification of the Philippine Consulate General at Dubai, and the accompanying documents, namely: Medico Legal Report issued by the Ministry of Justice of the United Arab Emirates and the Death Certificate issued by the Ministry of Health of the United Arab Emirates.\n\nAs a result of the foregoing events, respondent filed a Complaint before the Labor Arbiter claiming death compensation under seaman Glicerio\u2019s POEA contract.\n\nOn September 14, 2009, the Labor Arbiter rendered a Decision [5] awarding death compensation in the amount of US$71,500.00.\n\nThe Labor Arbiter ruled that petitioners failed to satisfactorily prove by substantial evidence that seaman Glicerio committed suicide as it relied on the inconclusive report of the medico-legal consultant, which merely gave the cause of death. The Labor Arbiter held as follows:\n[Respondent] Delia Malipot, in behalf of her deceased husband seaman Glicerio, is therefore entitled to death benefits and burial expenses pursuant to Section 20 (A) (1) and (4c) of the POEA Standard Employment Contract, which provide:\n1.\u00a0 In case of work-related death of the seafarer during the term of his contract, the employer shall pay his beneficiaries the Philippine currency equivalent to the amount of Fifty Thousand US Dollars (US$50,000) and an additional amount of Seven Thousand US Dollars (US$7,000) to each child under the age of twenty-one (21) but not exceeding four (4) children, at the exchange rate prevailing during the time of payment.\n\nxxx\u00a0 xxx\u00a0 xxx\n\n4. The other liabilities of the employer when the seafarer dies as a result of injury or illness during the term of employment are as follows:\n\nxxx\u00a0 xxx\u00a0 xxx\n\nc. The employer shall pay the beneficiaries of the seafarer the Philippine currency equivalent to the amount of One Thousand US Dollars (US$1,000) for burial expenses at the exchange rate prevailing during the time of payment.\nThere is no dispute that seaman Glicerio had two (2) legitimate minor children who, in addition to the death benefits of US$50,000.00, are entitled to US$7,000 each, plus burial allowance of US$1,000.00.\n\nThere is merit in [respondent]\u2019s claim that she is entitled to attorney\u2019s fees because she was forced to litigate and incur expenses to protect her rights and interests because of the unjust, unfair and totally unlawful acts of the [petitioners] in refusing to pay her claims. The same finds ample basis on Art. 2208, par. 2 of the Civil Code, which provides:\nArt. 2208. In the absence of stipulation, attorney\u2019s fees and expenses of litigation, other than judicial costs, cannot be recovered, except:\n\nxxx\u00a0 xxx\u00a0 xxx\n\n(2) When the defendant\u2019s act or omission has compelled the plaintiff to litigate with third persons or to incur expenses to protect his interests;\nWHEREFORE, premises considered, judgment is hereby rendered holding the above-named [petitioners] Unicol Maritime Services, Inc. and Victoriano B. Tirol III liable, jointly and severally, to pay [respondent] the following amounts:\n\n[TABLE_CONTENT]\n1. | US$50,000 | - | Death Benefits\n2. | US$14,000 | - | Death benefits for the two (2) minor children\n3. | US$1,000 | - | Burial Expenses\n | US$65,000 | - | Total\n4. | US$6,500 | - | 10% Attorney\u2019s fees\n | US$71,500.00 | - | Grand Total\n[END_TABLE]\n\n1.

US$6,500 - 10% Attorney\u2019s fees US$71,500.00 - Grand Total or in Philippine currency at the prevailing rate of exchange at the time of actual payment.\n\nAll other claims are dismissed.\n\nSO ORDERED. [6]\n\nOn October 7, 2009, petitioners appealed before the NLRC.\n\nOn September 30, 2010, the NLRC reversed and set aside the decision of the Labor Arbiter and dismissed respondent\u2019s complaint for lack of merit.\n\nIt its Decision, the NLRC ruled that petitioners have clearly shown that seaman Glicerio\u2019s death was due to suicide and that the same is not compensable under the POEA Employment Contract. Thus:\nAs such, there being no evidence to the contrary, We find that Glicerio Malipot in fact committed suicide. The Labor Arbiter thus seriously erred in ruling that there is no certainty as to the cause of Glicerio\u2019s death when the above documents clearly provided otherwise. In the same Great Southern Maritime case, the Supreme Court noted:\n\nIndeed, we are not unaware of our ruling in Becmen Service Exporter and Promotion, Inc. v. Cuaresma , where we held that Jasmin Cuaresma, also an overseas Filipino worker, did not commit suicide; that Filipinos are resilient people, willing to take on sacrifices for the good of their family; and that we do not easily succumb to hardships and difficulties. Nevertheless, the circumstances prevailing in said case are totally different from this case. In Becmen , the postmortem examination and the police report did not state with specificity that poisoning or suicide was the cause of Jasmin\u2018s death. In fact, both reports mentioned that the cause of death of Jasmin was still under investigation. In contrast, the postmortem examination and the police report in this case, categorically mentioned that Salvador died of asphyxia due to hanging. It was also shown that no other individual could have caused the death of Salvador because the bathroom door was locked or bolted from the inside and could not be opened from the outside.\n\nx x x x\n\nAs such, herein [respondent] is not entitled to any death benefits nor to attorney\u2019s fees.\n\nWHEREFORE, the appealed Decision is hereby REVERSED and SET ASIDE. Another one entered DISMISSING the instant complaint for lack of merit.\n\nSO ORDERED. [7]\nRespondent filed a Motion for Reconsideration. However, the same was denied and the dismissal of the claim for death benefits was affirmed by the NLRC in a Resolution dated December 30, 2010.\n\nAccordingly, respondent filed a certiorari petition before the CA alleging that the NLRC committed grave abuse of discretion when it gave weight to the Medico-Legal Report issued by Dr. Osman Abdul Hameed Awad and the Death Certificate issued by the United Arab Emirates Ministry of Health as the same are inconclusive as to the cause of seaman Glicerio\u2019s death.\n\nIn its Decision dated October 29, 2012, the CA reversed the NLRC ruling and awarded death benefits holding that petitioners failed to prove the cause or circumstances which lead to seaman Glicerio\u2019s suicide, viz.:\nApart from the Medico-Legal Report and Death Certificate, there is no showing that [petitioners] exerted effort to ascertain the circumstances surrounding Glicerio\u2019s death which was their duty to undertake as employer. As held by the Labor Arbiter, the Medico-Legal Report and Death Certificate are only evidence of the cause of death, but not of the circumstances surrounding Glicerio\u2019s death. While [petitioners] submitted an Investigation Report, log book extracts, and Master\u2019s Report, these were belatedly submitted on appeal to the NLRC via a Supplemental Memorandum of Appeal, yet, there is no indication that these are newly discovered evidence. Worse, a reading of these documents does not show the actual circumstances which surrounded Glicerio\u2019s death, for even the Investigation Report merely stated: \u201cThe local Fujairah Police is presently carrying out an investigation into the likely cause of death.\u201d\n\n[Petitioners] presented these reports to highlight Glicerio\u2019s supposed \u201cfamily problems\u201d which allegedly drove him to commit suicide. However, this supposition is contradicted by Glicerio\u2019s yearning to go home, as related to his wife during their conversations. Also, [petitioners] alleged that Glicerio\u2019s Contract of Employment was supposed to end on February 18, 2009 as his contract was for 4-6 months. In contrast though, Glicerio\u2019s Seabased Overseas Filipino Worker (OFW) sheet stated that his contract duration is for \u201c4 months, 0 days,\u201d so his contract should have ended on December 18, 2008. But whether it was in December or in February that Glicerio was slated to go home, We cannot subscribe to the idea that he decided to commit suicide at a time that was already so near the end of his contract. It is beyond human comprehension that a seaman who wanted to go home so badly would simply take his life for no reason at all.\n\nx x x x\n\nWe also note that Delia executed a Quitclaim and Release in consideration of the sum of Twelve Thousand Two Hundred Fifty-Four and 00/100 (Usd 12,254.00) US Dollars. But it has already been held that where it is shown that the person making the waiver did so voluntarily and with full understanding of what he is doing and the consideration of the quitclaim is credible, the transaction must be recognized as a valid and binding undertaking. But where the consideration for the quitclaim is inordinately low and exceedingly unreasonable, the quitclaim cannot be considered as an obstacle to the pursuit of legitimate claims. Noting that the consideration of the quitclaim, US$12,254.00, is inordinately low compared to the US$71,500.00 awarded by the Labor Arbiter, We find it, therefore, to be palpably inequitable. However, to avoid any unjust enrichment here, the amount received by Delia must be deducted from the monetary award.\n\nWHEREFORE, premises considered, the instant petition is GRANTED. The assailed September 30, 2010 Decision and December 30, 2010 Resolution are SET ASIDE. The September 14, 2009 Decision of the Labor Arbiter is REINSTATED with MODIFICATION in that the amount of US$12,254.00 which Delia received from [petitioners] is hereby ordered deducted from the award of US$71,500.00 with interest at the rate of 6% per annum from September 14, 2009, the date of the Labor Arbiter\u2019s judgment, until the finality of this decision, and thereafter at the rate of 12% per annum until full payment.\n\nSO ORDERED. [8]\nPetitioners filed a Motion for Reconsideration against said Decision, but the same proved futile as it was denied by the CA in a Resolution [9] dated March 27, 2013.\n\nHence, the present petition wherein petitioners present the following issues for our resolution:\nTHE RECORDS OF THIS CASE IS REPLETE WITH OVERWHELMING EVIDENCE THAT SEAFARER GLICERIO MALIPOT COMMITTED SUICIDE, YET THE COURT OF APPEALS DEATH BENEFITS RULING (sic) THAT \u201cTHERE IS NO SHOWING THAT HEREIN PETITIONERS EXERTED EFFORTS TO ASCERTAIN THE CIRCUMSTANCES SURROUNDING GLICERIO\u2019S DEATH.\u201d\n\nIS DEATH BY SUICIDE COMPENSABLE UNDER THE POEA CONTRACT? [10]\nIn essence, the main issue for resolution is whether seaman Glicerio committed suicide during the term of his employment contract which would exempt petitioners from paying the death compensation benefits to his beneficiaries.\n\nPetitioners insist that seaman Glicerio committed suicide. They aver that the CA erred in not considering the Medico-Legal Report [11] as well as the Death Certificate [12] submitted by the parties on the ground that the same are only evidence of the cause of death, but not the circumstances surrounding seaman Glicerio\u2019s suicide. Petitioners also lament the fact that the CA did not consider the Investigation Report, [13] log book extracts, [14] and Master\u2019s Report [15] which detailed the events that transpired before seaman Glicerio committed suicide. They contend that the CA erred in disregarding these pieces of evidence which convincingly rule out suspicions of foul play.\n\nThe petition is impressed with merit.\n\nAt the outset, it must be emphasized that the jurisdiction of the Court in cases brought before it under Rule 45 [16] of the Rules of Court is limited only to reviewing errors of law. However, this rule is subject to certain exceptions, namely:\n\n[TABLE_CONTENT]\n(1) | When the findings are grounded entirely on speculations, surmises or conjectures;\n(2) | When the inference made is manifestly mistaken, absurd or impossible;\n(3) | When there is grave abuse of discretion;\n(4) | When the judgment is based on misapprehension of facts;\n(5) | When the findings of fact are conflicting;[17]\n(6) | When in making its findings the Court of Appeals went beyond the issues of the case, or its findings are contrary to the admissions of both the appellant and the appellee;\n(7) | When the findings are contrary to that of the trial court;\n(8) | When the findings are conclusions without citation of specific evidence on which they are based;\n(9) | When the facts set forth in the petition as well as in the petitioner\u2019s main and reply briefs are not disputed by the respondent;\n(10) | When the findings of fact are premised on the supposed absence of evidence and contradicted by the evidence on record; or\n(11) | When the Court of Appeals manifestly overlooked certain relevant facts not disputed by the parties, which, if properly considered, would justify a different conclusion.[18]\n[END_TABLE]\n\n(1) When the findings are grounded entirely on speculations, surmises or conjectures; (2) When the inference made is manifestly mistaken, absurd or impossible; (3) When there is grave abuse of discretion; (4) When the judgment is based on misapprehension of facts; (5) When the findings of fact are conflicting; [17] (6) When in making its findings the Court of Appeals went beyond the issues of the case, or its findings are contrary to the admissions of both the appellant and the appellee; (7) When the findings are contrary to that of the trial court; (8) When the findings are conclusions without citation of specific evidence on which they are based; (9) When the facts set forth in the petition as well as in the petitioner\u2019s main and reply briefs are not disputed by the respondent; (10) When the findings of fact are premised on the supposed absence of evidence and contradicted by the evidence on record; or (11) When the Court of Appeals manifestly overlooked certain relevant facts not disputed by the parties, which, if properly considered, would justify a different conclusion. [18] Normally, the Supreme Court is not a trier of facts. However, since the findings of the CA and the NLRC were conflicting, it is incumbent upon this Court to wade through the records to find out if there was enough basis for the CA\u2019s reversal of the NLRC decision.\n\nIn this case, the CA ruled out the commission by seaman Glicerio of suicide on the ground that the evidence presented by petitioners, such as the Medico-Legal Report and Death Certificate, did not state the circumstances regarding the cause of seaman Glicerio\u2019s death. Also, the CA held that the Investigation Report, log book extracts, and Master\u2019s Report were submitted for the first time on appeal to the NLRC, and thus, should not have been admitted by the NLRC.\n\nFirst, this Court would like to underline the fact that the NLRC may receive evidence submitted for the first time on appeal on the ground that it may ascertain facts objectively and speedily without regard to technicalities of law in the interest of substantial justice.\n\nIn Sasan, Sr. v. National Labor Relations Commission 4 th Division , [19] We held that our jurisprudence is replete with cases allowing the NLRC to admit evidence, not presented before the Labor Arbiter, and submitted to the NLRC for the first time on appeal. The submission of additional evidence before the NLRC is not prohibited by its New Rules of Procedure considering that rules of evidence prevailing in courts of law or equity are not controlling in labor cases. The NLRC and Labor Arbiters are directed to use every and all reasonable means to ascertain the facts in each case speedily and objectively, without regard to technicalities of law and procedure all in the interest of substantial justice. In keeping with this directive, it has been held that the NLRC may consider evidence, such as documents and affidavits, submitted by the parties for the first time on appeal. [20]\n\nMoreover, among the powers of the Commission as provided in Section 218 of the Labor Code is that the Commission may issue subpoenas requiring the attendance and testimony of witnesses or the production of such books, papers, contracts, records, statement of accounts, agreements, and others. [21] In addition, the Commission may, among other things, conduct investigation for the determination of a question, matter or controversy within its jurisdiction, proceed to hear and determine the disputes in the absence of any party thereto who has been summoned or served with notice to appear, conduct its proceedings or any part thereof in public or in private, adjourn its hearings to any time and place, refer technical matters or accounts to an expert and to accept his report as evidence after hearing of the parties upon due notice. [22] From the foregoing, it can be inferred that the NLRC can receive evidence on cases appealed before the Commission, otherwise, its factual conclusions would not have been given great respect, much weight, and relevance [23] when an adverse party assails the decision of the NLRC via petition for certiorari under Rule 65 of the Rules of Court before the CA and then to this Court via a petition for review under Rule 45. [24]\n\nAccordingly, if we take into consideration the Investigation Report, log book extracts and Master\u2019s Report submitted by petitioners, the same all strongly point out that seaman Glicerio died because he committed suicide.\n\nContrary to the findings of the CA, it appears that the Investigation Report submitted by Inchcape Shipping Services completely detailed the events that happened prior to seaman Glicerio\u2019s death, i.e. , from the last person who corresponded with him when he was still alive, the circumstances leading to the day he was discovered dead, to the person who discovered him dead. Based on the investigation, it appears that seaman Glicerio was cheerful during the first two months. However, he, thereafter, kept to himself after telling people that his family is facing problems in the Philippines and that he already informed petitioners to look for his replacement.\n\nThe result of the above investigations is even bolstered by the Medical Report [25] issued by Dr. Sajeed Aboobaker who diagnosed seaman Glicerio with musculoskeletal pain and emotional trauma due to family problems, when the latter complained of chest pains and palpitations on December 10, 2008.\n\nSecond, both the Medico-Legal Report and Death Certificate indicate that the actual cause of death of seaman Glicerio is \u201csuicidal asphyxia due to hanging.\u201d\n\nThe Medico-Legal Report issued by the United Arab Emirates, Ministry of Justice states:\nMedico-Legal Report on Case No. 2/2009/Casualties\n\nIn accordance with the letter of the Director of Fujairah Public Prosecution dated 09.07.2006 to carry out the external examination on the remains of Mr. Glicerio Ramirez [M]alipot, Filipino national, to show the reason of death and how death occurred, I, Prof. Dr. Osman Abdul Hameed Awad, medico-legal senior consultant in Fujairah, hereby certify that I carried out the external examination on the aforementioned body on 15.01.2009 at Fujairah Hospital Postmortem. I also reviewed the minutes of investigations. Moreover, I hereby decide the following:\n\nA) External Examination:\n\nThe body is for a man aging about 56 years, in a saprophytic state because of being in the refrigerator along with blood precipitation in the upper and lower limbs. I noticed a deep lacerated groove transverse in the front of the neck and upper the level of the thyroid gristle with 2 cm width, going up and to the two sides of the neck and disappears beneath the ear along with the emergence of the tongue outside the mouth. I did not notice any recent injuries in the body.\n\nB) Opinion:\n\nBased on the above, I decide the following:\n\n1)\u00a0 Based on the external examination of the body of the aforementioned deceased a deep lacerated groove round the neck. It (sic) vital and recent. It occurs as a result of pressure and hanging with an elastic body such as a rope or similar.\n\n2)\u00a0 The death is due to suicidal Asphyxia due to hanging.\n\n3)\u00a0 The time of death synchronizes with the given date. [26]\nFrom the foregoing, it can be inferred that there was no foul play regarding seaman Glicerio\u2019s suicide considering that an external examination of his body shows no violence or resistance or any external injuries. In fact, the post-mortem examination conclusively established that the true cause of death was suicidal asphyxia due to hanging.\n\nAll told, taking the Medico-Legal Report and the Death Certificate, together with the Investigation Report, log book extracts, and Master\u2019s Report, we find that petitioners were able to substantially prove that seaman Glicerio\u2019s death was attributable to his deliberate act of killing himself by committing suicide.\n\nWith that settled, we now resolve the issue of whether respondent is entitled to death compensation benefits under the POEA Standard Employment Contract.\n\nSection 20 of the POEA \u201c Standard Terms and Conditions Governing the Overseas Employment of Filipino Seafarers On-Board Ocean-Going Ships ,\u201d provides:\nSECTION 20. COMPENSATION AND BENEFITS\n\nA.\u00a0 COMPENSATION AND BENEFITS FOR INJURY OR ILLNESS\n\nx x x x\n\nB.\u00a0\u00a0 COMPENSATION AND BENEFITS FOR DEATH\nIn case of work-related death of the seafarer, during the term of his contract, the employer shall pay his beneficiaries the Philippine currency equivalent to the amount of Fifty Thousand US dollars (US$50,000) and an additional amount of Seven Thousand US dollars (US$7,000) to each child under the age of twenty-one (21) but not exceeding four (4) children, at the exchange rate prevailing at the time of payment.\nx x x x\n\n[TABLE_CONTENT]\nD. | No compensation and benefits shall be payable in respect of any injury, incapacity, disability or death of the seafarer resulting from his willful or criminal act or intentional breach of his duties, provided however, that the employer can prove that such injury, incapacity, disability or death is directly attributable to the seafarer.[27]\n[END_TABLE]\n\nD. No compensation and benefits shall be payable in respect of any injury, incapacity, disability or death of the seafarer resulting from his willful or criminal act or intentional breach of his duties, provided however, that the employer can prove that such injury, incapacity, disability or death is directly attributable to the seafarer. [27]\nClearly, the employer is liable to pay the heirs of the deceased seafarer for death benefits once it is established that he died during the effectivity of his employment contract. However, the employer may be exempt from liability if it can successfully prove that the seaman\u2019s death was caused by an injury directly attributable to his deliberate or willful act. [28] Thus, since petitioners were able to substantially prove that seaman Glicerio\u2019s death is directly attributable to his deliberate act of hanging himself, his death, therefore, is not compensable and his heirs not entitled to any compensation or benefits.\n\nFinally, although this Court commiserates with the respondent, absent substantial evidence from which reasonable basis for the grant of benefits prayed for can be drawn, we are left with no choice but to deny her petition, lest an injustice be caused to the employer. While it is true that labor contracts are impressed with public interest and the provisions of the POEA Employment Contract must be construed logically and liberally in favor of Filipino seamen in the pursuit of their employment on board ocean-going vessels, still the rule is that justice is in every case for the deserving, to be dispensed with in the light of established facts, the applicable law, and existing jurisprudence.

DIWATA UPPER ULIP MANDAYA TRIBAL COUNCIL, INC. AND BALITE INTEGRATED SMALL-SCALE MINING CORP., (BISSMICO), RESPONDENTS. [G.R. NO. 149916] HON. ANTONIO H. CERILLES, IN HIS CAPACITY AS SECRETARY OF DEPARTMENT OF ENVIRONMENT AND NATURAL RESOURCES, PETITIONER, VS. SOUTHEAST MINDANAO GOLD MINING CORPORATION (SMGMC) AND BALITE INTEGRATED SMALL-SCALE MINING CORP., (BISSMICO), RESPONDENTS.D E C I S I O N LEONEN, J.: These two consolidated cases involve the \u201cDiwalwal Gold Rush Area\u201d in Mt. Diwata, Mindanao that has been embroiled in controversies since the mid-1980\u2019s.[1] The instant controversy focuses on the 729-hectare portion excluded from respondent Southeast Mindanao Gold Mining Corporation\u2019s Mineral Production Sharing Agreement application, and declared as People\u2019s Small Scale Mining Area. Due to supervening events, we declare the petitions moot and academic.Before us are two petitions for review[2] assailing the Court of Appeals\u2019 August 27, 2001 amended decision[3] that annulled and set aside the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) Secretary\u2019s September 20, 1999 decision[4] for having been issued with grave abuse of discretion in excess of his discretion.Moncayo Integrated Small-Scale Miners Association, Inc. (MISSMA) filed the first petition[5] docketed as G.R. No. 149638. Then DENR Secretary Antonio H. Cerilles filed the second petition docketed as G.R. No. 149916.[6]The facts as summarized by the Court of Appeals follow:[7]On July 1, 1985, the Bureau of Forest Development issued to Marcopper Mining Corporation (Marcopper) a prospecting permit (Permit to Prospect No. 755-123185) covering 4,941 hectares within the Agusan-Davao-Surigao Forest Reserve. This forest reserve was instituted by Proclamation No. 369 issued by then Governor General Dwight F. Davis on February 27, 1931.On March 10, 1986, the Bureau of Mines and Geo-Sciences issued to Marcopper a permit to explore (EP 133) covering the same area.On February 16, 1994, Marcopper assigned EP 133 to Southeast Mindanao Gold Mining Corporation (SMGMC).On December 19, 1995, the Mines and Geo-Sciences Bureau director ordered the publication of SMGMC\u2019s application for Mineral Production Sharing Agreement (MPSA No. 128) for the 4,941 hectares covered by EP 133.JB Management Mining Corporation, Davao United Miners Cooperative, Balite Integrated Small Scale Miners Cooperative, MISSMA, PICOP, Rosendo Villaflor, et al., Antonio G. Dacudao, Puting Bato Gold Miners Cooperative, and Romeo Altamera, et al. filed adverse claims against MPSA No. 128.[8]The adverse claims were anchored on DENR Administrative Order No. 66[9] (DAO No. 66) issued on December 27, 1991, declaring 729 hectares of the Agusan-Davao-Surigao Forest Reserve as forest land open for small-scale mining purposes, subject to existing and valid private rights.The DENR constituted a panel of arbitrators pursuant to Section 77 of the Philippine Mining Act of 1995 tasked to resolve the adverse claims against MPSA No. 128.The panel of arbitrators, in its decision dated June 13, 1997, reiterated the validity of EP 133 and dismissed all adverse claims against MPSA No. 128. The adverse claimants appealed to the Mines Adjudication Board.The Mines Adjudication Board (MAB), in its decision[10] dated January 6, 1998, vacated the decision of the panel of arbitrators:WHEREFORE, PREMISES CONSIDERED, the decision of the Panel of Arbitrators dated 13 June 1997 is hereby VACATED and a new one entered in the records of the case as follows:1. SEM\u2019s MPSA application is hereby given due course subject to the full and strict compliance of the provisions of the Mining Act and its Implementing Rules and Regulations.2. The area covered by DAO 66, series of 1991, actually occupied and actively mined by the small-scale miners on or before August 1, 1987 as determined by the Provincial Mining Regulatory Board (\u201cPMRB\u201d), is hereby excluded from the area applied for by SEM; (Emphasis supplied)3. A moratorium on all mining and mining-related activities, is hereby imposed until such time that all necessary procedures, licenses, permits and other requisites as provided for by RA 7076, the Mining Act and its Implementing Rules and Regulations and all other pertinent laws, rules and regulations are complied with, and the appropriate environmental protection measures and safeguards have been effectively put in place.4. Consistent with the spirit of RA 7076, the Board encourages SEM and all small-scale miners to continue to negotiate in good faith and arrive at an agreement beneficial to all. In the event of SEM\u2019s strict and full compliance with all the requirements of the Mining Act and its Implementing Rules and Regulations, and the concurrence of the small-scale miners actually occupying and actively mining the area, SEM may apply for the inclusion of portions of the areas segregated under paragraph 2 hereof, to its MPSA application. In this light, subject to the preceding paragraph, the contract between JB and SEM is hereby recognized.SO ORDERED.[11]Both SMGMC and the adverse claimants questioned the Mines Adjudication Board\u2019s decision before this court. These petitions were remanded to the Court of Appeals as CA-G.R. SP Nos. 61215-16, later elevated to this court as G.R. No. 152613, G.R. No. 152628, G.R. Nos 152619-20, and G.R. Nos. 152870-71.[12]Meanwhile, independent of the MAB decision and the appeals to the Court of Appeals and this court, the Provincial Mining Regulatory Board of Davao proposed to declare a People\u2019s Small Scale Mining Area in accordance with the MAB decision.[13]On February 24, 1992, the notice for the proposed declaration was approved and issued for publication to notify any and all oppositors or protestors.[14] Those who filed oppositions included SMGMC, Picop Resources Incorporated, Mt. Diwata-Upper Ulip Mandaya Tribal Council, and JB Management Mining Corporation.[15]The Provincial Mining Regulatory Board (PMRB), in its decision[16] dated March 30, 1999, dismissed the oppositions for lack of merit, then segregated and declared the 729-hectare gold rush area as People's Small Scale Mining Area:WHEREFORE, in view of the foregoing premises, the instant protest/opposition of herein Oppositors are hereby DISMISSED for lack of merit. This Board hereby segregates and declares the 729-hectare gold rush area in Mt. Diwalwal actually occupied and actively mined on or before August 1, 1987 as People\u2019s Small-Scale Mining Area. Thereafter, the concerned local government unit through the recommendation of this Board shall issue/execute the necessary small-scale mining contract to qualified applicants upon compliance of the requisites for small scale mining under R.A. 7076 and its implementing rules and regulations.SO ORDERED.[17]Then DENR Secretary Antonio H. Cerilles, in his decision dated September 20, 1999, affirmed with modification the Provincial Mining and Regulatory Board decision:[18]WHEREFORE, premises considered, the Decision of the PMRB of Compostela Valley dated March 30, 1999 is hereby AFFIRMED, subject to the following modifications:1. For effective management and equitable utilization of resources, the two main areas of operations as described above of the 729 hectares shall be delineated and embodied in a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) among the stakeholders concerned to ensure recognition of delineated boundaries and rational operation of the concerned areas.2. These two areas are divided as follows: a) Block I [Balete-Nang Area], composed of Sub-Block A and Sub-Block B, intended for Blucor and Helica Group of Tunnels, representing MISSMA, and for various qualified Small-Scale Miners who are actually occupying and actively mining in the area and b) Block II [Buenas-Tinago Area], intended for JB Management, and other qualified Small-Scale Miners who are actually occupying and actively mining in the area.3. Qualified Small-Scale Miners in each area, as maybe determined by the PMRB, shall apply for Small Scale Mining Contracts with option thereafter to apply for an MPSA.4. Consistent with the provisions of DENR Memorandum Order No. 99-02, mineral processing plants in the Diwalwal area shall be relocated to processing zones duly designated by the DENR where appropriate tailings disposal systems have been put in place.5. The Natural Resources Development Corporation (NRDC), the corporate arm of the DENR, shall extend the necessary technical expertise and supervision over all mining and milling operations in the area, environmental clean-up and rehabilitation activities, and the identification of alternative livelihood activities for the families of small-scale miners and other residents in the area.SO ORDERED.[19] (Emphasis and underscoring in the original)The DENR Secretary denied reconsideration on February 2, 2000. SMGMC filed a petition under Rule 43 before the Court of Appeals.The Court of Appeals, in its decision[20] dated July 31, 2000, denied the petition.The Court of Appeals discussed that since \u201cthere being no injunction from the Supreme Court which would prevent the enforcement of the MAB decision, respondent DENR Secretary acted with propriety in issuing the assailed decision which affirmed the PMRB\u2019s declaration of a People\u2019s Small Scale Mining Area.\u201d[21] It also denied the petition based on litis pendencia, considering that the pending case before this court assailing the MAB decision involved a prejudicial question.[22]SMGMC and Balite Integrated Small-Scale Mining Corp. (BISSMICO) filed separate motions for reconsideration.The Court of Appeals, in its amended decision[23] dated August 27, 2001, granted the motions for reconsideration and, consequently, set aside and annulled the DENR Secretary's decision for having been issued with grave abuse of discretion in excess of his jurisdiction.[24]The Court of Appeals limited its discussion on the propriety of the DENR Secretary\u2019s decision.It cited at length a memorandum dated March 27, 1998 by then DENR Undersecretary, Antonio La Vi\u00f1a, to support its finding that SMGMC \u201cmay apply and be entitled to a particular area within the 729 hectares potential coverage of the People\u2019s Small-Scale Mining Area, subject to the fulfilment of several conditions.\u201d[25]The Court of Appeals found that the \u201cDENR Secretary\u2019s outright delineation of the subject area in favor of certain entities contravenes the mandate of the MAB Decision and the purpose of RA 7076 (People\u2019s Small-Scale Mining Act of 1991), inasmuch as it disenfranchises the petitioner and other small-scale miners who may apply for and be awarded small-scale mining contracts by the local government units upon recommendation of the PMRB after the fulfilment of necessary conditions set forth in the law.\u201d[26]Hence, these two petitions for review were filed assailing the Court of Appeals' amended decision.Petitioner MISSMA[27] argues that the Court of Appeals should not have amended its decision considering it already found SMGMC guilty of forum shopping and litis pendencia.[28]Petitioner MISSMA contends that the petition docketed as G.R. No. 132475 assailing the portion of the MAB\u2019s decision that excluded the 729-hectare area covered by DAO No. 66 from SMGMC\u2019s Mines Production Sharing Agreement application[29] involves the same issues as the present cases. MISSMA submits that \u201cthe ultimate objective of the two cases is [SMGMC] to solely obtain all mining rights over the subject 729 hectare gold rush area, to the exclusion of MISSMA and other claimants thereon.\u201d[30]Petitioner MISSMA also argues that \u201c[i]n carrying out the function of declaring and segregating gold rush areas for small-scale mining purposes [pursuant to Republic Act No. 7076], both the PMRB, and upon review, the DENR Secretary, may well act independently of the MAB, which, on the other hand is a quasi-judicial body tasked to settle mining conflicts, disputes or claims[.]\u201d[31] Moreover, the DENR Secretary\u2019s decision only delineated and identified areas available for small-scale mining contract applications. The decision did not make actual awards.[32]Petitioner Hon. Antonio H. Cerilles, in his capacity as then DENR Secretary,[33] similarly argues that the Court of Appeals should have maintained its earlier decision dismissing the case due to forum shopping and litis pendencia.[34]In any event, petitioner DENR Secretary argues that he acted within authority in modifying the PMRB\u2019s decision, citing Sections 24 and 26 of Republic Act No. 7076 on the DENR Secretary\u2019s power of \u201cdirect supervision and control.\u201d[35]Petitioner DENR Secretary adds that \u201c[t]he division into two areas of the segregated portion of 729-hectares small-scale mining area does not contravene the mandate of the MAB decision and the purpose of R.A. No. 7076, since there is no award yet of any license or permit made to any qualified small-scale miner.\u201d[36]Lastly, petitioner DENR Secretary contends that these petitions have been mooted by (1) then President Macapagal-Arroyo\u2019s issuance of Proclamation No. 297 excluding an area from Proclamation No. 369 and declaring this as a mineral reservation and as an environmentally critical area, and (2) this court\u2019s decision dated June 23, 2006 in G.R. Nos. 152613, 152628, 152619-20, 152870-71 declaring DAO No. 66 as void, declaring EP 133 as expired, and underscoring the Executive\u2019s power of supervision and control over the exploration, development, and utilization of the country\u2019s mineral resources.[37]Respondent SMGMC counters that no forum shopping or litis pendencia exists as the present petitions \u201cemanated from the decision of the PMRB declaring the 729 hectares of timberland as People\u2019s Small-Scale Mining Area, while G.R. No. 132475 emanated from the decision of the MAB on the MPSA Application of [SMGMC].\u201d[38] Records also show that the case docketed as G.R. No. 132475 was made known to this court.[39]Respondent SMGMC quoted at length DENR Undersecretary La Vi\u00f1a\u2019s memorandum on the scope of the MAB decision.[40]Respondent SMGMC submits that the DENR Secretary\u2019s decision \u201cpractically abandoned the MAB decision and fashioned his own formula for disaster,\u201d such as mentioning the Blucor and Helica groups which were never parties before the PMRB.[41]Respondent BISSMICO admits and adopts respondent SMGMC\u2019s memorandum.[42]Respondent PICOP discusses the difference between \u201cforest reserves\u201d and \u201cforest reservations\u201d under Presidential Decree No. 705,[43] and pursuant to Republic Act No. 3092[44] enacted on June 17, 1961, stating that \u201ca law should now be passed by Congress in order to reclassify areas in forest reserve to another use.\u201d[45]Even Executive Order No. 318 issued on June 9, 2004 on guiding principles in Promoting Sustainable Forest Management in the Philippines provides that \u201c[c]onversions of forestlands into non-forestry uses shall be allowed only through an act of Congress and upon the recommendation of concerned government agencies.\u201d[46] Consequently, the PMRB has no authority to declare the 729 hectares within the forest reserve as a People\u2019s Small-Scale Mining Area.[47]Respondent PICOP also argues that Proclamation No. 297 by then President Macapagal-Arroyo was without congressional concurrence as required by Republic Act No. 3092, thus, revocable.[48] Its memorandum also includes arguments on how Proclamation No. 297 was the first step in a series of constitutional violations such as an agreement with ZTE \u2013NBN involving the gold rush area.[49]By resolution[50] dated March 4, 2013, the parties were required to file manifestations on \u201csubsequent developments that may help this court in the immediate disposition of these cases, or that may render the cases moot and academic.\u201d[51]Petitioner DENR Secretary, through its counsel Office of the Solicitor General, filed its compliance on May 16, 2013.[52]Petitioner DENR Secretary submitted a copy of the letter[53] dated April 24, 2013 of the Philippine Mining Development Corporation (PMDC), the government office in charge of the Diwalwal area, containing details of the latest development in the area. The letter[54] provides a brief background, followed by an enumeration of developments:I. PMDC 729 Area in the Diwalwal Mineral Reservation. . . The Terms of Reference (TOR) for the 729 Bidding [partner of PMDC in the exploration and development of the project area] was approved by the Board on 3 March 2010.On October 25, 2011, PMDC received an order from the Regional Trial Court . . . enjoining [it] from bidding the Victory Tunnel and the 729-Area. PMDC filed a Motion for Reconsideration [which] is still pending . . .II. Tribal Mining Area (TRIMA) in the Diwalwal Mineral ReservationOn 26 June 2009, an Operating Agreement was entered into by PMDC and the Indigenous Cultural Community (ICC) belonging to the Mandaya, Manobo, Manguangan and Dibabawon tribes covering 2 parcels in the Diwalwal Mineral Reservation having a total land area of 950 hectares.. . . .PMDC requested NCIP to settle the issues of the tribal leadership and representation with finality in order to guide PMDC and its operators/partners, as well as other parties interested in assisting the tribe.PMDC is still awaiting the final decision of NCIP. FF Cruz & Co., Inc. is still actively pursuing its aforesaid Agreement with the ICC.III. Other Areas in the Diwalwal Mineral ReservationA. Upper Ulip Property. . . area of One Thousand Six Hundred Twenty hectares (1,620 has.) has been awarded, after a public bidding, to Paraiso Consolidated Mining Corporation (PACOMINCO) on June 2009.On 1 March 2012, the PMDC Board approved the extension of the period for exploration activities for the Upper Ulip-Paraiso Parcel.B. Letter V. . . area of One Thousand Two Hundred Ninety Six hectares (1,296 has.) has been awarded, after public bidding, to Black Stone Mineral Resources Inc. (Blackstone) on March 2010.Blackstone is currently in the process of securing the Free and Prior-Informed Consent of the ICC in the Area with the assistance of NCIP. On 5 March 2013, Blackstone entered into a Memorandum of Agreement with the Mandaya tribe for the development of the Letter V parcel within the [sic] their ancestral domain.C. Higanteng Bato. . . area of One Thousand Three Hundred Fifty Nine hectares (1,359 has.) has been awarded, after a public bidding, to Carrascal Nickel Corporation (CNC) on March 2010.On 19 July 2012, the PMDC Board approved the assignment of the Rights and Obligations of CNC in the Joint Operating Agreement to Giant Stone Corporation.IV. NRDC Area (729 Area, 600m asl)[PMDC has] received reports that NRDC has awarded approximately 400 hectares of the area under their administration to JBMMC. However, despite several requests for information relative to the aforementioned reports, the NRDC has yet to provide PMDC of any official documents . . .[55]Respondent SMGMC filed an explanation, manifestation, and compliance discussing that on June 23, 2006, this court\u2019s First Division rendered a decision in the consolidated petitions of Apex (G.R. Nos. 152613 and 152628), Balite Communal Portal Cooperative (G.R. Nos. 152619-20), and MAB (G.R. Nos. 152870-71) ruling that EP 133 has expired by its non-renewal, that its transfer to SMGMC was void, and that DAO No. 66 was illegal for having been issued in excess of the DENR Secretary\u2019s authority.[56] On November 20, 2009, this court En Banc denied reconsideration, and this decision became final and executory.[57]Respondent SMGMC also manifested that (a) the above decision and resolution, (b) the issuance of Proclamation No. 297 dated November 25, 2002, excluding 8,100 hectares in Moncayo, Compostela Valley and proclaiming this area as a mineral reservation and as an environmentally critical area, and (c) DAO No. 2002-18, are supervening developments that rendered moot and academic the issues raised in the present petitions.[58]Counsel for respondent MISSMA filed a manifestation stating that he has exerted diligent efforts to communicate with MISSMA in relation to the March 4, 2013 resolution but this proved futile. Counsel is not in a position to manifest to this court on subsequent developments, but he will continue his attempt to communicate with MISSMA, and will submit the required manifestation should he succeed.[59]Counsel for respondent PICOP filed a similar explanation/compliance.[60]The issues for resolution may be summarized as follows: Whether the Court of Appeals can set aside the issue of forum shopping and litis pendencia (SMGMC's petition in G.R. No. 132475), and dwell on the merits;Whether the DENR Secretary\u2019s decision went beyond the PMRB\u2019s decision, otherwise, whether the DENR Secretary can modify the PMRB\u2019s decision; andWhether the DENR Secretary\u2019s modification to divide the 729 hectares into two areas contravened the mandate of the MAB decision and the purpose of Republic Act No. 7076.Subsequent developmentsDevelopments after these petitions had been filed in 2001 mooted this case. The parties recognized these developments in their recent submissions.Petitioner DENR Secretary raised that the petitions were mooted by (a) then President Macapagal-Arroyo\u2019s issuance of Proclamation No. 297, excluding an area from Proclamation No. 369 and declaring this area as a mineral reservation and as an environmentally critical area, and (b) this court\u2019s decision dated June 23, 2006 in G.R. Nos. 152613, 152628, 152619-20, and 152870-71 declaring DAO No. 66 as void, declaring EP 133 as expired, and underscoring the Executive\u2019s power of supervision and control over the exploration, development, and utilization of the country\u2019s mineral resources.[61]Respondent SMGMC similarly manifested that Proclamation No. 297 dated November 25, 2002 and this court\u2019s 2006 decision and 2009 resolution in G.R. Nos. 152613 and 152628, G.R. Nos. 152619-20 and G.R. Nos. 152870-71 mooted the present cases.[62]Proclamation No. 297 dated November 25, 2002 excluded an area of 8,100 hectares in Moncayo, Compostela Valley as a mineral reservation and as an environmentally critical area:PROCLAMATION NO. 297EXCLUDING A CERTAIN AREA FROM THE OPERATION OF PROCLAMATION NO. 369 DATED FEBRUARY 27, 1931, AND DECLARING THE SAME AS MINERAL RESERVATION AND AS ENVIRONMENTALLY CRITICAL AREAWHEREAS, Article XII, Section 2 of the Constitution provides that the exploration, development, and utilization of natural resources shall be under the full control and supervision of the State;WHEREAS, by virtue of Proclamation No. 369, series of 1931, certain tracts of public land situated in the then provinces of Davao, Agusan and Surigao, with an area of approximately 1,927,400 hectares, were withdrawn from settlement and disposition, excluding, however, those portions which had been certified and/or shall be classified and certified as non-forest lands;WHEREAS, gold deposits have been found within the area covered by Proclamation No. 369, in the Municipality of Monkayo, Compostela Valley Province, and unregulated small to medium-scale mining operations have, since 1983, been undertaken therein, causing in the process serious environmental, health, and peace and order problems in the area;WHEREAS, it is in the national interest to prevent the further degradation of the environment and to resolve the health and peace and order spawned by the unregulated mining operations in the said area;WHEREAS, these problems may be effectively addressed by rationalizing mining operations in the area through the establishment of a mineral reservation;WHEREAS, after giving due notice, the Director of Mines and Geosciences conducted public hearings on September 6, 9 and 11, 2002 to allow the concerned sectors and communities to air their views regarding the establishment of a mineral reservation in the place in question;WHEREAS, pursuant to the Philippine Mining Act of 1995 (RA 7942), the President may, upon the recommendation of the Director of Mines and Geosciences, through the Secretary of Environment and Natural Resources, and when the national interest so requires, establish mineral reservations where mining operations shall be undertaken by the Department directly or thru a contractor;WHEREAS, as a measure to attain and maintain a rational and orderly balance between socio-economic growth and environmental protection, the President may, pursuant to Presidential Decree No. 1586, as amended, proclaim and declare certain areas in the country as environmentally critical;NOW, THEREFORE, I, GLORIA MACAPAGAL-ARROYO, President of the Philippines, upon recommendation of the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR), and by virtue of the powers vested in me by law, do hereby exclude certain parcel of land located in Monkayo, Compostela Valley, and proclaim the same as mineral reservation and as environmentally critical area, with metes and bound as defined by the following geographical coordinates; . . . .. . . .with an area of Eight Thousand One Hundred (8,100) hectares, more or less.Mining operations in the area may be undertaken either by the DENR directly, subject to payment of just compensation that may be due to legitimate and existing claimants, or thru a qualified contractor, subject to existing rights, if any.The DENR shall formulate and issue the appropriate guidelines, including the establishment of an environmental and social fund, to implement the intent and provisions of this Proclamation.Subsequently, DENR Administrative Order No. 2002-18 declared an emergency situation on the Diwalwal gold rush area and ordered the stoppage of all mining operations in the area.Then President Macapagal-Arroyo issued Executive Order No. 217 dated June 17, 2003, creating the National Task Force Diwalwal to address the situation in the Diwalwal gold rush area.On June 23, 2006, this court promulgated Apex Mining v. SMGMC,[63] ruling on the petitions for review by Apex, Balite, and the MAB. This court declared that EP 133 expired on July 7, 1994, and that its subsequent transfer to SMGMC on February 16, 1994 was void.[64] This court also affirmed the Court of Appeals\u2019 decision declaring DAO No. 66 as illegal for having been issued in excess of the DENR Secretary\u2019s authority.[65]On November 20, 2009, this court En Banc denied reconsideration in Apex Mining v. SMGMC for lack of merit.[66] This court reiterated that Marcopper\u2019s assignment of EP 133 to SMGMC violated Section 97 of Presidential Decree No. 463 and the terms and conditions in the permit.[67]This court also clarified that its June 23, 2006 decision did not overturn its July 16, 1991 decision in Apex Mining v. Garcia[68] for the following reasons:[69]First, the 1991 case of Apex Mining v. Garcia involved conflicting mining claims between Apex and Marcopper over the 4,941 hectares disputed area in Moncayo, Mindanao.[70]This court in Apex Mining v. Garcia ruled that the disputed areas, \u201cbeing clearly within a forest reserve, are not open to mining location,\u201d[71] citing Sections 8 and 13 of Presidential Decree No. 463, as amended by Presidential Decree No. 1385.[72] This court found that \u201cprocedural requisites were complied with and undertaken by MARCOPPER after it had ascertained that its mining claims were found to be within the Agusan-Davao-Surigao Forest Reserve. On the other hand, the mining claims and SSMPs of Apex being located within said forest reserve are in violation of the law and therefore result in a failure to validly acquire mining rights.\u201d[73]Second, the 1991 Apex Mining v. Garcia case \u201cwas decided on facts and issues that were not attendant in [Apex Mining v. SMGMC], such as the expiration of EP 133, the violation of the condition embodied in EP 133 prohibiting its assignment, and the unauthorized and invalid assignment of EP 133 by [Marcopper] to [SMGMC], since this assignment was effected without the approval of the Secretary of DENR.\u201d[74]This court also mentioned that in the November 26, 1992 resolution in Apex Mining v. Garcia, this court clarified that its ruling was \u201cconclusive only between the parties with respect to the particular issue herein raised and under the set of circumstances herein prevailing[.]\u201d [75]Forum shopping and litis pendenciaLitis pendencia exists when the following elements are present: \u201c(a) the identity of parties, or at least such as representing the same interests in both actions; (b) the identity of rights asserted and relief prayed for, the relief being founded on the same facts; and (c) the identity of the two cases such that judgment in one, regardless of which party is successful, would amount to res judicata in the other.\u201d[76]The existence of litis pendencia also means that the rule against forum shopping was violated.[77]The Court of Appeals\u2019 July 31, 2000 decision denied SMGMC\u2019s petition on the ground of litis pendencia and forum shopping considering the then pending case docketed as G.R. No. 132475 assailing the January 6, 1998 MAB decision recognizing DAO No. 66 by excluding the 729-hectare area.[78]The Court of Appeals\u2019 August 27, 2001 amended decision \u201cmaintain that matters pertaining to the petitioner\u2019s rights over the subject 729-hectare gold rush area have been decided by the Mines Adjudication Board (MAB), which decision is now with the Supreme Court for review[,]\u201d[79] but it nevertheless annulled the DENR Secretary\u2019s decision \u201cfor having been issued with grave abuse of discretion in excess of his jurisdiction.\u201d[80]Respondent SMGMC argued in its memorandum that no forum shopping or litis pendencia exists,[81] but later conceded in its explanation, manifestation, and compliance dated September 1, 2014 that supervening developments, such as this court\u2019s 2006 decision and 2009 resolution in Apex Mining v. SMGMC, mooted these cases.[82]We do not need to decide on whether there was forum shopping or litis pendencia. Apex Mining v. SMGMC mooted these petitions.Moot and academicApex Mining v. SMGMC consists of two consolidated cases.[83] SMGMC filed the petition docketed as G.R. No. 132475 assailing the January 6, 1998 MAB decision excluding the 729-hectares area and questioning the validity of DAO No. 66. MISSMA and other mining claimants filed the other petition docketed as G.R. No. 132528.[84]These petitions were remanded to the Court of Appeals, consolidated as G.R. SP Nos. 61215 and 61216.[85] The Court of Appeals declared the MAB decision as null and void.[86]Consequently, Apex filed a petition docketed as G.R. Nos. 152613 and 152628; Balite Communal Portal Mining Cooperative, Inc. filed a petition docketed as G.R. Nos. 152619-20; and the MAB and its members filed a petition docketed as G.R. Nos. 152870-71.[87]All these petitions were consolidated, and this court rendered its decision entitled Apex Mining v. SMGMC on June 23, 2006, and resolution on November 20, 2009. The 2006 decision held:WHEREFORE, premises considered, the Petitions of Apex, Balite and the MAB are PARTIALLY GRANTED, thus:1. We hereby REVERSE and SET ASIDE the Decision of the Court of Appeals, dated 13 March 2002, and hereby declare that EP 133 of MMC has EXPIRED on 7 July 1994 and that its subsequent transfer to SEM on 16 February 1994 is VOID.2. We AFFIRM the finding of the Court of Appeals in the same Decision declaring DAO No. 66 illegal for having been issued in excess of the DENR Secretary\u2019s authority.Consequently, the State, should it so desire, may now award mining operations in the disputed area to any qualified entity it may determine. No costs.SO ORDERED.[88]This court denied the motions for reconsiderations, among others, in its 2009 resolution.[89]Since this court declared that EP 133 expired and its transfer to SMGMC is void, respondent SMGMC has no more basis to claim any right over the disputed 729 hectares in the Diwalwal gold rush area excluded from its MPSA.Furthermore, since this court has declared that the DENR Secretary had no authority to issue DAO No. 66 declaring 729 hectares of the Agusan-Davao-Surigao Forest Reserve as forest land open for small-scale mining purposes subject to existing and valid private rights, both the PMRB decision, and the DENR Secretary\u2019s decision affirming it with modification, are consequently overturned for lack of basis in delineating the 729 hectares from the MPSA.The 2009 resolution in Apex Mining v. SMGMC also ruled that \u201cthe State, through the Executive Department, should it so desire, may now award mining operations in the disputed area to any qualified entities it may determine [and] [t]he Mines and Geosciences Bureau may process exploration permits pending before it, taking into consideration the applicable mining laws, rules and regulations relative thereto.\u201d[90]Indeed, then President Macapagal-Arroyo issued Proclamation No. 297 excluding an area in Moncayo, Compostela Valley, declaring this as a mineral reservation and as an environmentally critical area. DENR Administrative Order No. 2002-18 followed, declaring an emergency situation in this gold rush area and ordering the stoppage of all mining operations. Executive Order No. 217 thereafter created the National Task Force Diwalwal.Authority and functionsin mining activitiesIn any case, we discuss the powers of the different agencies in relation to mining activities as laid down by the relevant laws.Mines Adjudication BoardChapter XIII (Settlement of Conflicts) of Republic Act No. 7942 known as the Mining Act of 1995 provides for the powers of the panel of arbitrators and the Mines Adjudication Board (MAB). Section 77 states that \u201cthe panel shall have exclusive and original jurisdiction to hear and decide on the following:Disputes involving rights to mining areas;Disputes involving mineral agreements or permits;Disputes involving surface owners, occupants and claimholders/ concessionaires; andDisputes pending before the Bureau and the Department at the date of the effectivity of this Act.\u201d[91]Section 78 provides for the MAB\u2019s appellate jurisdiction over the decision or order of the panel of arbitrators.[92] Section 79 enumerates the MAB\u2019s powers and functions, including the power \u201cto conduct hearings on all matters within its jurisdiction.\u201d[93]Provincial Mining Regulatory BoardWhile the MAB\u2019s jurisdiction covers the settlement of conflicts over mining claims, the Provincial Mining Regulatory Board (PMRB) \u2014 created under Republic Act No. 7076 known as the People\u2019s Small-Scale Mining Act of 1991 \u2014 granted powers that include functions more executive in nature such as declaring and segregating areas for small-scale mining.[94]Section 24 of Republic Act No. 7076 provides for the PMRB\u2019s power to \u201cdeclare and segregate existing gold-rich areas for small-scale mining\u201d but \u201cunder the direct supervision and control of the Secretary\u201d:Section 24. Provincial/ City Mining Regulatory Board. There is hereby created under the direct supervision and control of the Secretary a provincial/city mining regulatory board, herein called the Board, which shall be the implementing agency of the Department, and shall exercise the following powers and functions, subject to review by the Secretary: (a) Declare and segregate existing gold-rich areas for small-scale mining; (b) Reserve future gold and other mining areas for small-scale mining; (c) Award contracts to small-scale miners; (d) Formulate and implement rules and regulations related to small-scale mining; (e) Settle disputes, conflicts or litigations over conflicting claims within a people\u2019s small-scale mining area, an area that is declared a small mining area; and (f) Perform such other functions as may be necessary to achieve the goals and objectives of this Act.[95] Section 22 of DAO No. 34\u201392, the implementing rules and regulations of Republic Act No. 7076, similarly states that the \u201cProvincial/City Mining Regulatory Board created under RA 7076 shall exercise the following powers and functions, subject to review by the Secretary[.]\u201d[96]Section 6 of DAO No. 34\u201392 also provides that \u201c[t]he Board created under RA 7076 shall have the authority to declare and set aside People\u2019s Small-Scale Mining Areas in sites onshore suitable for small-scale mining operations subject to review by the DENR Secretary thru the Director[.]\u201d[97]DENR SecretarySection 26 of Republic Act No. 7076 reiterates the DENR Secretary\u2019s power of control over \u201cthe program and the activities of the small-scale miners within the people\u2019s small-scale mining area\u201d:Section 26. Administrative Supervision over the People\u2019s Small-scale Mining Program. The Secretary through his representative shall exercise direct supervision and control over the program and activities of the small-scale miners within the people\u2019s small-scale mining area.The Secretary shall within ninety (90) days from the effectivity of this Act promulgate rules and regulations to effectively implement the provisions of the same. Priority shall be given to such rules and regulations that will ensure the least disruption in the operations of the small-scale miners.[98]Section 21.1 of DAO No. 34\u201392, the implementing rules and regulations of Republic Act No. 7076, states that the DENR Secretary has \u201cdirect supervision and control over the program and the activities of the small-scale miners within the people\u2019s small-scale mining area.\u201d[99]This court has distinguished the power of control and the power of supervision as follows:. . . In administrative law, supervision means overseeing or the power or authority of an officer to see that subordinate officers perform their duties. If the latter fail or neglect to fulfill them, the former may take such action or step as prescribed by law to make them perform their duties. Control, on the other hand, means the power of an officer to alter or modify or nullify or set aside what a subordinate officer ha[s] done in the performance of his duties and to substitute the judgment of the former for that of the latter.[100] (Emphasis supplied)League of Provinces v. DENR[101] discussed that \u201cthe Local Government Code did not fully devolve the enforcement of the small-scale mining law to the provincial government, as its enforcement is subject to the supervision, control and review of the DENR, which is in charge, subject to law and higher authority, of carrying out the State\u2019s constitutional mandate to control and supervise the exploration, development, utilization of the country\u2019s natural resources.\u201d[102]Since the DENR Secretary has power of control as opposed to power of supervision, he had the power to affirm with modification the PMRB\u2019s decision.Executive DepartmentThe Constitution provides that \u201c[t]he State may directly undertake such activities, or it may enter into co-production, joint venture, or production-sharing agreements with Filipino citizens, or corporations or associations at least sixty per centum of whose capital is owned by such citizens[.]\u201d[103]Moreover, \u201c[t]he President may enter into agreements with foreign-owned corporations involving either technical or financial assistance for large scale exploration, development, and utilization of minerals, petroleum, and other mineral oils according to the general terms and conditions provided by law, based on real contributions to the economic growth and general welfare of the country[.]\u201d[104]Chapter II, Section 4 of Republic Act No. 7942 known as the Philippine Mining Act of 1995 also provides as follows:SEC. 4. Ownership of Mineral Resources. \u2013 Mineral resources are owned by the State and the exploration, development, utilization, and processing thereof shall be under its full control and supervision. The state may directly undertake such activities or it may enter into mineral agreements with contractors.The State shall recognize and protect the rights of the indigenous cultural communities to their ancestral lands as provided for by the Constitution.[105]Section 5 of Republic Act No. 7942 on mineral reservations provides that \u201c[m]ining operations in existing mineral reservations and such other reservations as may thereafter be established, shall be undertaken by the Department or through a contractor[.]\u201d[106]Apex Mining v. SMGMC discussed that \"Section 5 of Republic Act No. 7942 is a special provision, as it specifically treats of the establishment of mineral reservations only. Said provision grants the President the power to proclaim a mineral land as a mineral reservation, regardless of whether such land is also an existing forest reservation.\u201d[107]In the 2002 case of Southeast Mindanao Gold Mining Corporation v. Balite Portal Mining Cooperative[108] involving the same Diwalwal gold rush area, this court discussed that \u201cthe State may not be precluded from considering a direct takeover of the mines, if it is the only plausible remedy in sight to the gnawing complexities generated by the gold rush.\u201d[109]Incidentally, we acknowledge that PICOP raised the validity of Proclamation No. 297 in its memorandum.[110] It argues that Proclamation No. 297 by then President Macapagal-Arroyo was without congressional concurrence as required by Republic Act No. 3092, thus, revocable.[111] The validity of Proclamation No. 297, however, is not an issue in these cases. This subsequent development was not litigated, and this is not the proper case to assail its validity.WHEREFORE, in view of the foregoing, the petitions are DENIED for being moot and academic.WE CONCUR:Carpio, (Chairperson), Del Castillo, Villarama, Jr.,* and Mendoza, JJ., concur.* Designated Acting Member per Special Order No. 1888 dated November 28, 2014.[1] See Southeast Mindanao Gold Mining Corporation v.

Mineral Reservations. - When the national interest so requires, such as when there is a need to preserve strategic raw materials for industries critical to national development, or certain minerals for scientific, cultural or ecological value, the President may establish mineral reservations upon the recommendation of the Director through the Secretary. Mining operations in existing mineral reservations and such other reservations as may thereafter be established, shall be undertaken by the Department or through a contractor: Provided, That a small scale-mining cooperative covered by Republic Act No. 7076 shall be given preferential right to apply for a small-scale mining agreement for a maximum aggregate area of twenty-five percent (25%) of such mineral reservation, subject to valid existing mining/quarrying rights as provided under Section 112 Chapter XX hereof. All submerged lands within the contiguous zone and in the exclusive economic zone of the Philippines are hereby declared to be mineral reservations.A ten per centum (10%) share of all royalties and revenues to be derived by the government from the development and utilization of the mineral resources within mineral reservations as provided under this Act shall accrue to the Mines and Geosciences Bureau to be allotted for special projects and other administrative expenses related to the exploration and development of other mineral reservations mentioned in Section 6 hereof.[107] Apex Mining Co, Inc. v.

SOUTHEAST MINDANAO GOLD MINING CORPORATION (SMGMC) AND BALITE INTEGRATED SMALL-SCALE MINING CORP., (BISSMICO), RESPONDENTS.\n\nD E C I S I O N\n\nLEONEN, J.:\n\nThese two consolidated cases involve the \u201cDiwalwal Gold Rush Area\u201d in Mt. Diwata, Mindanao that has been embroiled in controversies since the mid-1980\u2019s. [1] The instant controversy focuses on the 729-hectare portion excluded from respondent Southeast Mindanao Gold Mining Corporation\u2019s Mineral Production Sharing Agreement application, and declared as People\u2019s Small Scale Mining Area. Due to supervening events, we declare the petitions moot and academic.\n\nBefore us are two petitions for review [2] assailing the Court of Appeals\u2019 August 27, 2001 amended decision [3] that annulled and set aside the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) Secretary\u2019s September 20, 1999 decision [4] for having been issued with grave abuse of discretion in excess of his discretion.\n\nMoncayo Integrated Small-Scale Miners Association, Inc. (MISSMA) filed the first petition [5] docketed as G.R. No. 149638. Then DENR Secretary Antonio H. Cerilles filed the second petition docketed as G.R. No. 149916. [6]\n\nThe facts as summarized by the Court of Appeals follow: [7]\n\nOn July 1, 1985, the Bureau of Forest Development issued to Marcopper Mining Corporation (Marcopper) a prospecting permit (Permit to Prospect No. 755-123185) covering 4,941 hectares within the Agusan-Davao-Surigao Forest Reserve. This forest reserve was instituted by Proclamation No. 369 issued by then Governor General Dwight F. Davis on February 27, 1931.\n\nOn March 10, 1986, the Bureau of Mines and Geo-Sciences issued to Marcopper a permit to explore (EP 133) covering the same area.\n\nOn February 16, 1994, Marcopper assigned EP 133 to Southeast Mindanao Gold Mining Corporation (SMGMC).\n\nOn December 19, 1995, the Mines and Geo-Sciences Bureau director ordered the publication of SMGMC\u2019s application for Mineral Production Sharing Agreement (MPSA No. 128) for the 4,941 hectares covered by EP 133.\n\nJB Management Mining Corporation, Davao United Miners Cooperative, Balite Integrated Small Scale Miners Cooperative, MISSMA, PICOP, Rosendo Villaflor, et al., Antonio G. Dacudao, Puting Bato Gold Miners Cooperative, and Romeo Altamera, et al. filed adverse claims against MPSA No. 128. [8]\n\nThe adverse claims were anchored on DENR Administrative Order No. 66 [9] (DAO No. 66) issued on December 27, 1991, declaring 729 hectares of the Agusan-Davao-Surigao Forest Reserve as forest land open for small-scale mining purposes, subject to existing and valid private rights.\n\nThe DENR constituted a panel of arbitrators pursuant to Section 77 of the Philippine Mining Act of 1995 tasked to resolve the adverse claims against MPSA No. 128.\n\nThe panel of arbitrators, in its decision dated June 13, 1997, reiterated the validity of EP 133 and dismissed all adverse claims against MPSA No. 128. The adverse claimants appealed to the Mines Adjudication Board.\n\nThe Mines Adjudication Board (MAB), in its decision [10] dated January 6, 1998, vacated the decision of the panel of arbitrators:\n\nWHEREFORE, PREMISES CONSIDERED , the decision of the Panel of Arbitrators dated 13 June 1997 is hereby VACATED and a new one entered in the records of the case as follows:\n\n1. SEM\u2019s MPSA application is hereby given due course subject to the full and strict compliance of the provisions of the Mining Act and its Implementing Rules and Regulations.\n\n2. The area covered by DAO 66, series of 1991, actually occupied and actively mined by the small-scale miners on or before August 1, 1987 as determined by the Provincial Mining Regulatory Board (\u201cPMRB\u201d), is hereby excluded from the area applied for by SEM; (Emphasis supplied)\n\n3. A moratorium on all mining and mining-related activities, is hereby imposed until such time that all necessary procedures, licenses, permits and other requisites as provided for by RA 7076, the Mining Act and its Implementing Rules and Regulations and all other pertinent laws, rules and regulations are complied with, and the appropriate environmental protection measures and safeguards have been effectively put in place.\n\n4. Consistent with the spirit of RA 7076, the Board encourages SEM and all small-scale miners to continue to negotiate in good faith and arrive at an agreement beneficial to all. In the event of SEM\u2019s strict and full compliance with all the requirements of the Mining Act and its Implementing Rules and Regulations, and the concurrence of the small-scale miners actually occupying and actively mining the area, SEM may apply for the inclusion of portions of the areas segregated under paragraph 2 hereof, to its MPSA application. In this light, subject to the preceding paragraph, the contract between JB and SEM is hereby recognized.\n\nSO ORDERED . [11]\n\nBoth SMGMC and the adverse claimants questioned the Mines Adjudication Board\u2019s decision before this court. These petitions were remanded to the Court of Appeals as CA-G.R. SP Nos. 61215-16, later elevated to this court as G.R. No. 152613, G.R. No. 152628, G.R. Nos 152619-20, and G.R. Nos. 152870-71. [12]\n\nMeanwhile, independent of the MAB decision and the appeals to the Court of Appeals and this court, the Provincial Mining Regulatory Board of Davao proposed to declare a People\u2019s Small Scale Mining Area in accordance with the MAB decision. [13]\n\nOn February 24, 1992, the notice for the proposed declaration was approved and issued for publication to notify any and all oppositors or protestors. [14] Those who filed oppositions included SMGMC, Picop Resources Incorporated, Mt. Diwata-Upper Ulip Mandaya Tribal Council, and JB Management Mining Corporation. [15]\n\nThe Provincial Mining Regulatory Board (PMRB), in its decision [16] dated March 30, 1999, dismissed the oppositions for lack of merit, then segregated and declared the 729-hectare gold rush area as People's Small Scale Mining Area:\n\nWHEREFORE, in view of the foregoing premises, the instant protest/opposition of herein Oppositors are hereby DISMISSED for lack of merit. This Board hereby segregates and declares the 729-hectare gold rush area in Mt. Diwalwal actually occupied and actively mined on or before August 1, 1987 as People\u2019s Small-Scale Mining Area. Thereafter, the concerned local government unit through the recommendation of this Board shall issue/execute the necessary small-scale mining contract to qualified applicants upon compliance of the requisites for small scale mining under R.A. 7076 and its implementing rules and regulations.\n\nSO ORDERED. [17]\n\nThen DENR Secretary Antonio H. Cerilles, in his decision dated September 20, 1999, affirmed with modification the Provincial Mining and Regulatory Board decision: [18]\n\nWHEREFORE , premises considered, the Decision of the PMRB of Compostela Valley dated March 30, 1999 is hereby AFFIRMED , subject to the following modifications:\n\n1. For effective management and equitable utilization of resources, the two main areas of operations as described above of the 729 hectares shall be delineated and embodied in a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) among the stakeholders concerned to ensure recognition of delineated boundaries and rational operation of the concerned areas.\n\n2. These two areas are divided as follows: a) Block I [Balete-Nang Area], composed of Sub-Block A and Sub-Block B , intended for Blucor and Helica Group of Tunnels, representing MISSMA, and for various qualified Small-Scale Miners who are actually occupying and actively mining in the area and b) Block II [Buenas-Tinago Area], intended for JB Management, and other qualified Small-Scale Miners who are actually occupying and actively mining in the area.\n\n3. Qualified Small-Scale Miners in each area, as maybe determined by the PMRB, shall apply for Small Scale Mining Contracts with option thereafter to apply for an MPSA.\n\n4. Consistent with the provisions of DENR Memorandum Order No. 99-02, mineral processing plants in the Diwalwal area shall be relocated to processing zones duly designated by the DENR where appropriate tailings disposal systems have been put in place.\n\n5. The Natural Resources Development Corporation (NRDC), the corporate arm of the DENR, shall extend the necessary technical expertise and supervision over all mining and milling operations in the area, environmental clean-up and rehabilitation activities, and the identification of alternative livelihood activities for the families of small-scale miners and other residents in the area.\n\nSO ORDERED . [19] (Emphasis and underscoring in the original)\nThe DENR Secretary denied reconsideration on February 2, 2000. SMGMC filed a petition under Rule 43 before the Court of Appeals.\n\nThe Court of Appeals, in its decision [20] dated July 31, 2000, denied the petition.\n\nThe Court of Appeals discussed that since \u201cthere being no injunction from the Supreme Court which would prevent the enforcement of the MAB decision, respondent DENR Secretary acted with propriety in issuing the assailed decision which affirmed the PMRB\u2019s declaration of a People\u2019s Small Scale Mining Area.\u201d [21] It also denied the petition based on litis pendencia , considering that the pending case before this court assailing the MAB decision involved a prejudicial question. [22]\n\nSMGMC and Balite Integrated Small-Scale Mining Corp. (BISSMICO) filed separate motions for reconsideration.\n\nThe Court of Appeals, in its amended decision [23] dated August 27, 2001, granted the motions for reconsideration and, consequently, set aside and annulled the DENR Secretary's decision for having been issued with grave abuse of discretion in excess of his jurisdiction. [24]\n\nThe Court of Appeals limited its discussion on the propriety of the DENR Secretary\u2019s decision.\n\nIt cited at length a memorandum dated March 27, 1998 by then DENR Undersecretary, Antonio La Vi\u00f1a, to support its finding that SMGMC \u201cmay apply and be entitled to a particular area within the 729 hectares potential coverage of the People\u2019s Small-Scale Mining Area, subject to the fulfilment of several conditions.\u201d [25]\n\nThe Court of Appeals found that the \u201cDENR Secretary\u2019s outright delineation of the subject area in favor of certain entities contravenes the mandate of the MAB Decision and the purpose of RA 7076 (People\u2019s Small-Scale Mining Act of 1991), inasmuch as it disenfranchises the petitioner and other small-scale miners who may apply for and be awarded small-scale mining contracts by the local government units upon recommendation of the PMRB after the fulfilment of necessary conditions set forth in the law.\u201d [26]\n\nHence, these two petitions for review were filed assailing the Court of Appeals' amended decision.\n\nPetitioner MISSMA [27] argues that the Court of Appeals should not have amended its decision considering it already found SMGMC guilty of forum shopping and litis pendencia . [28]\n\nPetitioner MISSMA contends that the petition docketed as G.R. No. 132475 assailing the portion of the MAB\u2019s decision that excluded the 729-hectare area covered by DAO No. 66 from SMGMC\u2019s Mines Production Sharing Agreement application [29] involves the same issues as the present cases. MISSMA submits that \u201cthe ultimate objective of the two cases is [SMGMC] to solely obtain all mining rights over the subject 729 hectare gold rush area, to the exclusion of MISSMA and other claimants thereon.\u201d [30]\n\nPetitioner MISSMA also argues that \u201c[i]n carrying out the function of declaring and segregating gold rush areas for small-scale mining purposes [pursuant to Republic Act No. 7076], both the PMRB, and upon review, the DENR Secretary, may well act independently of the MAB, which, on the other hand is a quasi-judicial body tasked to settle mining conflicts, disputes or claims[.]\u201d [31] Moreover, the DENR Secretary\u2019s decision only delineated and identified areas available for small-scale mining contract applications. The decision did not make actual awards. [32]\n\nPetitioner Hon. Antonio H. Cerilles, in his capacity as then DENR Secretary, [33] similarly argues that the Court of Appeals should have maintained its earlier decision dismissing the case due to forum shopping and litis pendencia. [34]\n\nIn any event, petitioner DENR Secretary argues that he acted within authority in modifying the PMRB\u2019s decision, citing Sections 24 and 26 of Republic Act No. 7076 on the DENR Secretary\u2019s power of \u201cdirect supervision and control.\u201d [35]\n\nPetitioner DENR Secretary adds that \u201c[t]he division into two areas of the segregated portion of 729-hectares small-scale mining area does not contravene the mandate of the MAB decision and the purpose of R.A. No. 7076, since there is no award yet of any license or permit made to any qualified small-scale miner.\u201d [36]\n\nLastly, petitioner DENR Secretary contends that these petitions have been mooted by (1) then President Macapagal-Arroyo\u2019s issuance of Proclamation No. 297 excluding an area from Proclamation No. 369 and declaring this as a mineral reservation and as an environmentally critical area, and (2) this court\u2019s decision dated June 23, 2006 in G.R. Nos. 152613, 152628, 152619-20, 152870-71 declaring DAO No. 66 as void, declaring EP 133 as expired, and underscoring the Executive\u2019s power of supervision and control over the exploration, development, and utilization of the country\u2019s mineral resources. [37]\n\nRespondent SMGMC counters that no forum shopping or litis pendencia exists as the present petitions \u201cemanated from the decision of the PMRB declaring the 729 hectares of timberland as People\u2019s Small-Scale Mining Area, while G.R. No. 132475 emanated from the decision of the MAB on the MPSA Application of [SMGMC].\u201d [38] Records also show that the case docketed as G.R. No. 132475 was made known to this court. [39]\n\nRespondent SMGMC quoted at length DENR Undersecretary La Vi\u00f1a\u2019s memorandum on the scope of the MAB decision. [40]\n\nRespondent SMGMC submits that the DENR Secretary\u2019s decision \u201cpractically abandoned the MAB decision and fashioned his own formula for disaster,\u201d such as mentioning the Blucor and Helica groups which were never parties before the PMRB. [41]\n\nRespondent BISSMICO admits and adopts respondent SMGMC\u2019s memorandum. [42]\n\nRespondent PICOP discusses the difference between \u201cforest reserves\u201d and \u201cforest reservations\u201d under Presidential Decree No. 705, [43] and pursuant to Republic Act No. 3092 [44] enacted on June 17, 1961, stating that \u201ca law should now be passed by Congress in order to reclassify areas in forest reserve to another use.\u201d [45]\n\nEven Executive Order No. 318 issued on June 9, 2004 on guiding principles in Promoting Sustainable Forest Management in the Philippines provides that \u201c[c]onversions of forestlands into non-forestry uses shall be allowed only through an act of Congress and upon the recommendation of concerned government agencies.\u201d [46] Consequently, the PMRB has no authority to declare the 729 hectares within the forest reserve as a People\u2019s Small-Scale Mining Area. [47]\n\nRespondent PICOP also argues that Proclamation No. 297 by then President Macapagal-Arroyo was without congressional concurrence as required by Republic Act No. 3092, thus, revocable. [48] Its memorandum also includes arguments on how Proclamation No. 297 was the first step in a series of constitutional violations such as an agreement with ZTE \u2013NBN involving the gold rush area. [49]\n\nBy resolution [50] dated March 4, 2013, the parties were required to file manifestations on \u201csubsequent developments that may help this court in the immediate disposition of these cases, or that may render the cases moot and academic.\u201d [51]\n\nPetitioner DENR Secretary, through its counsel Office of the Solicitor General, filed its compliance on May 16, 2013. [52]\n\nPetitioner DENR Secretary submitted a copy of the letter [53] dated April 24, 2013 of the Philippine Mining Development Corporation (PMDC), the government office in charge of the Diwalwal area, containing details of the latest development in the area. The letter [54] provides a brief background, followed by an enumeration of developments:\n\nI. PMDC 729 Area in the Diwalwal Mineral Reservation\n\n. . . The Terms of Reference (TOR) for the 729 Bidding [partner of PMDC in the exploration and development of the project area] was approved by the Board on 3 March 2010.\n\nOn October 25, 2011, PMDC received an order from the Regional Trial Court . . . enjoining [it] from bidding the Victory Tunnel and the 729-Area. PMDC filed a Motion for Reconsideration [which] is still pending . . .\n\nII. Tribal Mining Area (TRIMA) in the Diwalwal Mineral Reservation\n\nOn 26 June 2009, an Operating Agreement was entered into by PMDC and the Indigenous Cultural Community (ICC) belonging to the Mandaya, Manobo, Manguangan and Dibabawon tribes covering 2 parcels in the Diwalwal Mineral Reservation having a total land area of 950 hectares.\n\n. . . .\n\nPMDC requested NCIP to settle the issues of the tribal leadership and representation with finality in order to guide PMDC and its operators/partners, as well as other parties interested in assisting the tribe.\n\nPMDC is still awaiting the final decision of NCIP. FF Cruz & Co., Inc. is still actively pursuing its aforesaid Agreement with the ICC.\n\nIII. Other Areas in the Diwalwal Mineral Reservation\n\nA. Upper Ulip Property\n\n. . . area of One Thousand Six Hundred Twenty hectares (1,620 has.) has been awarded, after a public bidding, to Paraiso Consolidated Mining Corporation (PACOMINCO) on June 2009.\n\nOn 1 March 2012, the PMDC Board approved the extension of the period for exploration activities for the Upper Ulip-Paraiso Parcel.\n\nB. Letter V\n\n. . . area of One Thousand Two Hundred Ninety Six hectares (1,296 has.) has been awarded, after public bidding, to Black Stone Mineral Resources Inc. (Blackstone) on March 2010.\n\nBlackstone is currently in the process of securing the Free and Prior-Informed Consent of the ICC in the Area with the assistance of NCIP. On 5 March 2013, Blackstone entered into a Memorandum of Agreement with the Mandaya tribe for the development of the Letter V parcel within the [sic] their ancestral domain.\n\nC. Higanteng Bato\n\n. . . area of One Thousand Three Hundred Fifty Nine hectares (1,359 has.) has been awarded, after a public bidding, to Carrascal Nickel Corporation (CNC) on March 2010.\n\nOn 19 July 2012, the PMDC Board approved the assignment of the Rights and Obligations of CNC in the Joint Operating Agreement to Giant Stone Corporation.\n\nIV. NRDC Area (729 Area, 600m asl)\n\n[PMDC has] received reports that NRDC has awarded approximately 400 hectares of the area under their administration to JBMMC. However, despite several requests for information relative to the aforementioned reports, the NRDC has yet to provide PMDC of any official documents . . . [55]\nRespondent SMGMC filed an explanation, manifestation, and compliance discussing that on June 23, 2006, this court\u2019s First Division rendered a decision in the consolidated petitions of Apex (G.R. Nos. 152613 and 152628), Balite Communal Portal Cooperative (G.R. Nos. 152619-20), and MAB (G.R. Nos. 152870-71) ruling that EP 133 has expired by its non-renewal, that its transfer to SMGMC was void, and that DAO No. 66 was illegal for having been issued in excess of the DENR Secretary\u2019s authority. [56] On November 20, 2009, this court En Banc denied reconsideration, and this decision became final and executory. [57]\n\nRespondent SMGMC also manifested that (a) the above decision and resolution, (b) the issuance of Proclamation No. 297 dated November 25, 2002, excluding 8,100 hectares in Moncayo, Compostela Valley and proclaiming this area as a mineral reservation and as an environmentally critical area, and (c) DAO No. 2002-18, are supervening developments that rendered moot and academic the issues raised in the present petitions. [58]\n\nCounsel for respondent MISSMA filed a manifestation stating that he has exerted diligent efforts to communicate with MISSMA in relation to the March 4, 2013 resolution but this proved futile. Counsel is not in a position to manifest to this court on subsequent developments, but he will continue his attempt to communicate with MISSMA, and will submit the required manifestation should he succeed. [59]\n\nCounsel for respondent PICOP filed a similar explanation/compliance. [60]\n\nThe issues for resolution may be summarized as follows:\n\nWhether the Court of Appeals can set aside the issue of forum shopping and litis pendencia (SMGMC's petition in G.R. No. 132475), and dwell on the merits;\n\nWhether the DENR Secretary\u2019s decision went beyond the PMRB\u2019s decision, otherwise, whether the DENR Secretary can modify the PMRB\u2019s decision; and\n\nWhether the DENR Secretary\u2019s modification to divide the 729 hectares into two areas contravened the mandate of the MAB decision and the purpose of Republic Act No. 7076.\nSubsequent developments\n\nDevelopments after these petitions had been filed in 2001 mooted this case. The parties recognized these developments in their recent submissions.\n\nPetitioner DENR Secretary raised that the petitions were mooted by (a) then President Macapagal-Arroyo\u2019s issuance of Proclamation No. 297, excluding an area from Proclamation No. 369 and declaring this area as a mineral reservation and as an environmentally critical area, and (b) this court\u2019s decision dated June 23, 2006 in G.R. Nos. 152613, 152628, 152619-20, and 152870-71 declaring DAO No. 66 as void, declaring EP 133 as expired, and underscoring the Executive\u2019s power of supervision and control over the exploration, development, and utilization of the country\u2019s mineral resources. [61]\n\nRespondent SMGMC similarly manifested that Proclamation No. 297 dated November 25, 2002 and this court\u2019s 2006 decision and 2009 resolution in G.R. Nos. 152613 and 152628, G.R. Nos. 152619-20 and G.R. Nos. 152870-71 mooted the present cases. [62]\n\nProclamation No. 297 dated November 25, 2002 excluded an area of 8,100 hectares in Moncayo, Compostela Valley as a mineral reservation and as an environmentally critical area:\n\nPROCLAMATION NO. 297\n\nEXCLUDING A CERTAIN AREA FROM THE OPERATION OF PROCLAMATION NO. 369 DATED FEBRUARY 27, 1931, AND DECLARING THE SAME AS MINERAL RESERVATION AND AS ENVIRONMENTALLY CRITICAL AREA\n\nWHEREAS, Article XII, Section 2 of the Constitution provides that the exploration, development, and utilization of natural resources shall be under the full control and supervision of the State;\n\nWHEREAS, by virtue of Proclamation No. 369, series of 1931, certain tracts of public land situated in the then provinces of Davao, Agusan and Surigao, with an area of approximately 1,927,400 hectares, were withdrawn from settlement and disposition, excluding, however, those portions which had been certified and/or shall be classified and certified as non-forest lands;\n\nWHEREAS, gold deposits have been found within the area covered by Proclamation No. 369, in the Municipality of Monkayo, Compostela Valley Province, and unregulated small to medium-scale mining operations have, since 1983, been undertaken therein, causing in the process serious environmental, health, and peace and order problems in the area;\n\nWHEREAS, it is in the national interest to prevent the further degradation of the environment and to resolve the health and peace and order spawned by the unregulated mining operations in the said area;\n\nWHEREAS, these problems may be effectively addressed by rationalizing mining operations in the area through the establishment of a mineral reservation;\n\nWHEREAS, after giving due notice, the Director of Mines and Geosciences conducted public hearings on September 6, 9 and 11, 2002 to allow the concerned sectors and communities to air their views regarding the establishment of a mineral reservation in the place in question;\n\nWHEREAS, pursuant to the Philippine Mining Act of 1995 (RA 7942), the President may, upon the recommendation of the Director of Mines and Geosciences, through the Secretary of Environment and Natural Resources, and when the national interest so requires, establish mineral reservations where mining operations shall be undertaken by the Department directly or thru a contractor;\n\nWHEREAS, as a measure to attain and maintain a rational and orderly balance between socio-economic growth and environmental protection, the President may, pursuant to Presidential Decree No. 1586, as amended, proclaim and declare certain areas in the country as environmentally critical;\n\nNOW, THEREFORE, I, GLORIA MACAPAGAL-ARROYO, President of the Philippines, upon recommendation of the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR), and by virtue of the powers vested in me by law, do hereby exclude certain parcel of land located in Monkayo, Compostela Valley, and proclaim the same as mineral reservation and as environmentally critical area, with metes and bound as defined by the following geographical coordinates; . . . .\n\n. . . .\n\nwith an area of Eight Thousand One Hundred (8,100) hectares, more or less.\n\nMining operations in the area may be undertaken either by the DENR directly, subject to payment of just compensation that may be due to legitimate and existing claimants, or thru a qualified contractor, subject to existing rights, if any.\n\nThe DENR shall formulate and issue the appropriate guidelines, including the establishment of an environmental and social fund, to implement the intent and provisions of this Proclamation.\nSubsequently, DENR Administrative Order No. 2002-18 declared an emergency situation on the Diwalwal gold rush area and ordered the stoppage of all mining operations in the area.\n\nThen President Macapagal-Arroyo issued Executive Order No. 217 dated June 17, 2003, creating the National Task Force Diwalwal to address the situation in the Diwalwal gold rush area.\n\nOn June 23, 2006, this court promulgated Apex Mining v. SMGMC , [63] ruling on the petitions for review by Apex, Balite, and the MAB. This court declared that EP 133 expired on July 7, 1994, and that its subsequent transfer to SMGMC on February 16, 1994 was void. [64] This court also affirmed the Court of Appeals\u2019 decision declaring DAO No. 66 as illegal for having been issued in excess of the DENR Secretary\u2019s authority. [65]\n\nOn November 20, 2009, this court En Banc denied reconsideration in Apex Mining v. SMGMC for lack of merit. [66] This court reiterated that Marcopper\u2019s assignment of EP 133 to SMGMC violated Section 97 of Presidential Decree No. 463 and the terms and conditions in the permit. [67]\n\nThis court also clarified that its June 23, 2006 decision did not overturn its July 16, 1991 decision in Apex Mining v. Garcia [68] for the following reasons: [69]\n\nFirst, the 1991 case of Apex Mining v. Garcia involved conflicting mining claims between Apex and Marcopper over the 4,941 hectares disputed area in Moncayo, Mindanao. [70]\n\nThis court in Apex Mining v. Garcia ruled that the disputed areas, \u201cbeing clearly within a forest reserve, are not open to mining location,\u201d [71] citing Sections 8 and 13 of Presidential Decree No. 463, as amended by Presidential Decree No. 1385. [72] This court found that \u201cprocedural requisites were complied with and undertaken by MARCOPPER after it had ascertained that its mining claims were found to be within the Agusan-Davao-Surigao Forest Reserve. On the other hand, the mining claims and SSMPs of Apex being located within said forest reserve are in violation of the law and therefore result in a failure to validly acquire mining rights.\u201d [73]\n\nSecond, the 1991 Apex Mining v. Garcia case \u201cwas decided on facts and issues that were not attendant in [ Apex Mining v. SMGMC ], such as the expiration of EP 133, the violation of the condition embodied in EP 133 prohibiting its assignment, and the unauthorized and invalid assignment of EP 133 by [Marcopper] to [SMGMC], since this assignment was effected without the approval of the Secretary of DENR.\u201d [74]\n\nThis court also mentioned that in the November 26, 1992 resolution in Apex Mining v. Garcia, this court clarified that its ruling was \u201cconclusive only between the parties with respect to the particular issue herein raised and under the set of circumstances herein prevailing[.]\u201d [75]\n\nForum shopping and litis pendencia\n\nLitis pendencia exists when the following elements are present: \u201c(a) the identity of parties, or at least such as representing the same interests in both actions; (b) the identity of rights asserted and relief prayed for, the relief being founded on the same facts; and (c) the identity of the two cases such that judgment in one, regardless of which party is successful, would amount to res judicata in the other.\u201d [76]\n\nThe existence of litis pendencia also means that the rule against forum shopping was violated. [77]\n\nThe Court of Appeals\u2019 July 31, 2000 decision denied SMGMC\u2019s petition on the ground of litis pendencia and forum shopping considering the then pending case docketed as G.R. No. 132475 assailing the January 6, 1998 MAB decision recognizing DAO No. 66 by excluding the 729-hectare area. [78]\n\nThe Court of Appeals\u2019 August 27, 2001 amended decision \u201cmaintain that matters pertaining to the petitioner\u2019s rights over the subject 729-hectare gold rush area have been decided by the Mines Adjudication Board (MAB), which decision is now with the Supreme Court for review[,]\u201d [79] but it nevertheless annulled the DENR Secretary\u2019s decision \u201cfor having been issued with grave abuse of discretion in excess of his jurisdiction.\u201d [80]\n\nRespondent SMGMC argued in its memorandum that no forum shopping or litis pendencia exists, [81] but later conceded in its explanation, manifestation, and compliance dated September 1, 2014 that supervening developments, such as this court\u2019s 2006 decision and 2009 resolution in Apex Mining v. SMGMC, mooted these cases. [82]\n\nWe do not need to decide on whether there was forum shopping or litis pendencia . Apex Mining v. SMGMC mooted these petitions.\n\nMoot and academic\n\nApex Mining v. SMGMC consists of two consolidated cases. [83] SMGMC filed the petition docketed as G.R. No. 132475 assailing the January 6, 1998 MAB decision excluding the 729-hectares area and questioning the validity of DAO No. 66. MISSMA and other mining claimants filed the other petition docketed as G.R. No. 132528. [84]\n\nThese petitions were remanded to the Court of Appeals, consolidated as G.R. SP Nos. 61215 and 61216. [85] The Court of Appeals declared the MAB decision as null and void. [86]\n\nConsequently, Apex filed a petition docketed as G.R. Nos. 152613 and 152628; Balite Communal Portal Mining Cooperative, Inc. filed a petition docketed as G.R. Nos. 152619-20; and the MAB and its members filed a petition docketed as G.R. Nos. 152870-71. [87]\n\nAll these petitions were consolidated, and this court rendered its decision entitled Apex Mining v. SMGMC on June 23, 2006, and resolution on November 20, 2009. The 2006 decision held:\n\nWHEREFORE , premises considered, the Petitions of Apex, Balite and the MAB are PARTIALLY GRANTED, thus:\n\n1. We hereby REVERSE and SET ASIDE the Decision of the Court of Appeals, dated 13 March 2002, and hereby declare that EP 133 of MMC has EXPIRED on 7 July 1994 and that its subsequent transfer to SEM on 16 February 1994 is VOID.\n\n2. We AFFIRM the finding of the Court of Appeals in the same Decision declaring DAO No. 66 illegal for having been issued in excess of the DENR Secretary\u2019s authority.\n\nConsequently, the State, should it so desire, may now award mining operations in the disputed area to any qualified entity it may determine. No costs.\n\nSO ORDERED . [88]\nThis court denied the motions for reconsiderations, among others, in its 2009 resolution. [89]\n\nSince this court declared that EP 133 expired and its transfer to SMGMC is void, respondent SMGMC has no more basis to claim any right over the disputed 729 hectares in the Diwalwal gold rush area excluded from its MPSA.\n\nFurthermore, since this court has declared that the DENR Secretary had no authority to issue DAO No. 66 declaring 729 hectares of the Agusan-Davao-Surigao Forest Reserve as forest land open for small-scale mining purposes subject to existing and valid private rights, both the PMRB decision, and the DENR Secretary\u2019s decision affirming it with modification, are consequently overturned for lack of basis in delineating the 729 hectares from the MPSA.\n\nThe 2009 resolution in Apex Mining v. SMGMC also ruled that \u201cthe State, through the Executive Department, should it so desire, may now award mining operations in the disputed area to any qualified entities it may determine [and] [t]he Mines and Geosciences Bureau may process exploration permits pending before it, taking into consideration the applicable mining laws, rules and regulations relative thereto.\u201d [90]\n\nIndeed, then President Macapagal-Arroyo issued Proclamation No. 297 excluding an area in Moncayo, Compostela Valley, declaring this as a mineral reservation and as an environmentally critical area. DENR Administrative Order No. 2002-18 followed, declaring an emergency situation in this gold rush area and ordering the stoppage of all mining operations. Executive Order No. 217 thereafter created the National Task Force Diwalwal.\n\nAuthority and functions\nin mining activities\n\nIn any case, we discuss the powers of the different agencies in relation to mining activities as laid down by the relevant laws.\n\nMines Adjudication Board\n\nChapter XIII (Settlement of Conflicts) of Republic Act No. 7942 known as the Mining Act of 1995 provides for the powers of the panel of arbitrators and the Mines Adjudication Board (MAB). Section 77 states that \u201cthe panel shall have exclusive and original jurisdiction to hear and decide on the following:\n\nDisputes involving rights to mining areas;\nDisputes involving mineral agreements or permits;\nDisputes involving surface owners, occupants and claimholders/ concessionaires; and\nDisputes pending before the Bureau and the Department at the date of the effectivity of this Act.\u201d [91]\nSection 78 provides for the MAB\u2019s appellate jurisdiction over the decision or order of the panel of arbitrators. [92] Section 79 enumerates the MAB\u2019s powers and functions, including the power \u201cto conduct hearings on all matters within its jurisdiction.\u201d [93]\n\nProvincial Mining Regulatory Board\n\nWhile the MAB\u2019s jurisdiction covers the settlement of conflicts over mining claims, the Provincial Mining Regulatory Board (PMRB) \u2014 created under Republic Act No. 7076 known as the People\u2019s Small-Scale Mining Act of 1991 \u2014 granted powers that include functions more executive in nature such as declaring and segregating areas for small-scale mining. [94]\n\nSection 24 of Republic Act No. 7076 provides for the PMRB\u2019s power to \u201cdeclare and segregate existing gold-rich areas for small-scale mining\u201d but \u201cunder the direct supervision and control of the Secretary\u201d:\n\nSection 24. Provincial/ City Mining Regulatory Board. There is hereby created under the direct supervision and control of the Secretary a provincial/city mining regulatory board, herein called the Board, which shall be the implementing agency of the Department, and shall exercise the following powers and functions, subject to review by the Secretary:\n\n[TABLE_CONTENT]\n(a) | Declare and segregate existing gold-rich areas for small-scale mining;\n(b) | Reserve future gold and other mining areas for small-scale mining;\n(c) | Award contracts to small-scale miners;\n(d) | Formulate and implement rules and regulations related to small-scale mining;\n(e) | Settle disputes, conflicts or litigations over conflicting claims within a people\u2019s small-scale mining area, an area that is declared a small mining area; and\n(f) | Perform such other functions as may be necessary to achieve the goals and objectives of this Act.[95]\n[END_TABLE]\n\n(a) Declare and segregate existing gold-rich areas for small-scale mining; (b) Reserve future gold and other mining areas for small-scale mining; (c) Award contracts to small-scale miners; (d) Formulate and implement rules and regulations related to small-scale mining; (e) Settle disputes, conflicts or litigations over conflicting claims within a people\u2019s small-scale mining area, an area that is declared a small mining area; and (f) Perform such other functions as may be necessary to achieve the goals and objectives of this Act. [95]\nSection 22 of DAO No. 34\u201392, the implementing rules and regulations of Republic Act No. 7076, similarly states that the \u201cProvincial/City Mining Regulatory Board created under RA 7076 shall exercise the following powers and functions, subject to review by the Secretary[.]\u201d [96]\n\nSection 6 of DAO No. 34\u201392 also provides that \u201c[t]he Board created under RA 7076 shall have the authority to declare and set aside People\u2019s Small-Scale Mining Areas in sites onshore suitable for small-scale mining operations subject to review by the DENR Secretary thru the Director[.]\u201d [97]\n\nDENR Secretary\n\nSection 26 of Republic Act No. 7076 reiterates the DENR Secretary\u2019s power of control over \u201cthe program and the activities of the small-scale miners within the people\u2019s small-scale mining area\u201d:\n\nSection 26. Administrative Supervision over the People\u2019s Small-scale Mining Program. The Secretary through his representative shall exercise direct supervision and control over the program and activities of the small-scale miners within the people\u2019s small-scale mining area.\n\nThe Secretary shall within ninety (90) days from the effectivity of this Act promulgate rules and regulations to effectively implement the provisions of the same. Priority shall be given to such rules and regulations that will ensure the least disruption in the operations of the small-scale miners. [98]\nSection 21.1 of DAO No. 34\u201392, the implementing rules and regulations of Republic Act No. 7076, states that the DENR Secretary has \u201cdirect supervision and control over the program and the activities of the small-scale miners within the people\u2019s small-scale mining area.\u201d [99]\n\nThis court has distinguished the power of control and the power of supervision as follows:\n\n. . . In administrative law, supervision means overseeing or the power or authority of an officer to see that subordinate officers perform their duties. If the latter fail or neglect to fulfill them, the former may take such action or step as prescribed by law to make them perform their duties. Control, on the other hand, means the power of an officer to alter or modify or nullify or set aside what a subordinate officer ha[s] done in the performance of his duties and to substitute the judgment of the former for that of the latter. [100] (Emphasis supplied)\nLeague of Provinces v. DENR [101] discussed that \u201cthe Local Government Code did not fully devolve the enforcement of the small-scale mining law to the provincial government, as its enforcement is subject to the supervision, control and review of the DENR, which is in charge, subject to law and higher authority, of carrying out the State\u2019s constitutional mandate to control and supervise the exploration, development, utilization of the country\u2019s natural resources.\u201d [102]\n\nSince the DENR Secretary has power of control as opposed to power of supervision, he had the power to affirm with modification the PMRB\u2019s decision.\n\nExecutive Department\n\nThe Constitution provides that \u201c[t]he State may directly undertake such activities, or it may enter into co-production, joint venture, or production-sharing agreements with Filipino citizens, or corporations or associations at least sixty per centum of whose capital is owned by such citizens[.]\u201d [103]\n\nMoreover, \u201c[t]he President may enter into agreements with foreign-owned corporations involving either technical or financial assistance for large scale exploration, development, and utilization of minerals, petroleum, and other mineral oils according to the general terms and conditions provided by law, based on real contributions to the economic growth and general welfare of the country[.]\u201d [104]\n\nChapter II, Section 4 of Republic Act No. 7942 known as the Philippine Mining Act of 1995 also provides as follows:\n\nSEC. 4. Ownership of Mineral Resources . \u2013 Mineral resources are owned by the State and the exploration, development, utilization, and processing thereof shall be under its full control and supervision. The state may directly undertake such activities or it may enter into mineral agreements with contractors.\n\nThe State shall recognize and protect the rights of the indigenous cultural communities to their ancestral lands as provided for by the Constitution. [105]\nSection 5 of Republic Act No. 7942 on mineral reservations provides that \u201c[m]ining operations in existing mineral reservations and such other reservations as may thereafter be established, shall be undertaken by the Department or through a contractor[.]\u201d [106]\n\nApex Mining v. SMGMC discussed that \"Section 5 of Republic Act No. 7942 is a special provision, as it specifically treats of the establishment of mineral reservations only. Said provision grants the President the power to proclaim a mineral land as a mineral reservation, regardless of whether such land is also an existing forest reservation.\u201d [107]\n\nIn the 2002 case of S outheast Mindanao Gold Mining Corporation v. Balite Portal Mining Cooperative [108] involving the same Diwalwal gold rush area, this court discussed that \u201cthe State may not be precluded from considering a direct takeover of the mines, if it is the only plausible remedy in sight to the gnawing complexities generated by the gold rush.\u201d [109]\n\nIncidentally, we acknowledge that PICOP raised the validity of Proclamation No. 297 in its memorandum. [110] It argues that Proclamation No. 297 by then President Macapagal-Arroyo was without congressional concurrence as required by Republic Act No. 3092, thus, revocable. [111] The validity of Proclamation No. 297, however, is not an issue in these cases. This subsequent development was not litigated, and this is not the proper case to assail its validity.\n\nWHEREFORE , in view of the foregoing, the petitions are DENIED for being moot and academic.\n\nWE CONCUR:\n\nCarpio, (Chairperson), Del Castillo, Villarama, Jr. , * and Mendoza, JJ., concur.\n\n* Designated Acting Member per Special Order No. 1888 dated November 28, 2014.\n\n[1] See Southeast Mindanao Gold Mining Corporation v.

      "title": "ONE SHIPPING CORP., AND/OR ONE SHIPPING KABUSHIKI KAISHA/JAPAN, PETITIONER, VS. IMELDA C. PE\u00d1AFIEL, RESPONDENT.DECISION PERALTA, J.: This is to resolve the Petition for Review on Certiorari under Rule 45 of the Revised Rules of Court, dated July 2, 2010, of petitioner One Shipping Corp., seeking the reversal of the Court of Appeals' Decision dated October 27, 2009 and Resolution dated May 27, 2010.[1]The antecedent facts follow.Petitioner One Shipping Corp., for and in behalf of its principal One Shipping Kabushiki Kaisha/Japan, hired the late Ildefonso S. Pe\u00f1afiel as Second Engineer on board the vessel MV/ACX Magnolia with a monthly basic salary of US$1,120.00 and for a duration of twelve (12) months. Pe\u00f1afiel boarded the vessel on August 29, 2004 and died on July 2, 2005. His wife then filed for monetary claims arising from his death.Respondent alleged that while her husband Ildefonso was performing his task on board the vessel, the latter felt a throbbing pain in his chest and shortening of breath, as if he was about to fall. Thinking that the same was due to his heavy workload, Ildefonso took a rest. However, after recovering, Ildefonso allegedly informed his superior about the pain but the latter ignored him. On May 21, 2005, Ildefonso disembarked from the vessel and returned to the Philippines on the same day. Respondent claims that upon arrival, Ildefonso reported to the petitioner manning agency to ask for medical attention for his condition, but instead of being sent for post medical examination, Ildefonso was allegedly informed by the petitioners that he was already scheduled for his next deployment. Thus, Ildefonso was required to undergo the pre-employment medical examination at the PMP Diagnostic Center, Inc. on July 2, 2005. However, after allegedly completing the medical and laboratory examinations, Ildefonso collapsed and was immediately brought to the Philippine General Hospital where he died at 2:05 p.m. of the same day due to myocardial infarction. As a result, respondent asserts that she called up petitioner manning agency and told them about the incident hoping that she would be given the necessary benefits.Petitioners, on the other hand, admitted that they contracted the services of the late Ildefonso on August 23, 2004, to work on board MV/ ACX Magnolia for a period of twelve (12) months. However, they denied any liability for the claims of the respondent and maintained that at the time Ildefonso died on July 2, 2005, the latter was no longer an employee of the petitioners as he voluntarily terminated his employment contract with the petitioners when, on April 9, 2005, Ildefonso requested for a leave and pre-terminated his contract. Thus, he disembarked from the vessel on May 21, 2005. They also alleged that in the early part of June 2005, Ildefonso reported at petitioner's office applying for a new employment and requested that he be lined up for another vessel. Accordingly, he was advised to undergo the usual pre-employment medical examination before considering his request. Petitioners were then surprised when they learned about Ildefonso's passing.The Labor Arbiter,[2] on September 20, 2006, dismissed the complaint for lack of merit.[3] Thus, respondent filed her appeal with the National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC)[4] in which the latter affirmed the decision of the Labor Arbiter on January 24, 2008.[5] Undaunted, respondent filed a petition for certiorari under Rule 65 of the Revised Rules of Court with the CA. The CA granted her petition, thus:WHEREFORE, the petition is GRANTED. The Resolutions dated January 24, 2008 and March 31, 2008 of the National Labor Relations Commission are REVERSED and SET ASIDE. Private respondents One Shipping Corporation and One Shipping Kabushiki Kaisha/Japan are hereby ordered to jointly and severally pay the following death benefits to petitioner Imelda C. Pe\u00f1afiel: US$50,000.00 for herself and US$21,000.00 for her three (3) minor children. The private respondents are likewise directed to solidarily pay petitioner US$1,000.00 as burial expenses. No costs.SO ORDERED.The motion for reconsideration having been denied, petitioners come to this Court raising the following issues:ASSIGNMENT OF ERRORSIWITH ALL DUE RESPECT, THE HONORABLE COURT OF APPEALS COMMITTED A SERIOUS ERROR IN LAW AND JURISPRUDENCE WHEN IT REVERSED AND SET ASIDE THE TWIN RESOLUTIONS OF THE NLRC DATED JANUARY 24, 2008 AND MARCH 31, 2008 DESPITE THE FACT THAT SAID RESOLUTIONS HAVE ATTAINED FINALITY.IITHE HONORABLE COURT OF APPEALS GRAVELY ERRED IN GRANTING RESPONDENT'S PETITION FOR CERTIORARI WITHOUT SHOWING THAT THE HONORABLE NLRC ACTED WITH GRAVE ABUSE OF DISCRETION, AMOUNTING TO LACK OF OR IN EXCESS OF JURISDICTION, WHEN IT RENDERED THE ASSAILED RESOLUTIONS OF JANUARY 24, 2008 AND MARCH 31, 2008.IIITHE HONORABLE COURT OF APPEALS ACTED ERRONEOUSLY WHEN IT FOUND THE PETITIONERS LIABLE FOR DEATH BENEFITS, NOTWITHSTANDING THE FACT THAT AT THE TIME RESPONDENT'S SPOUSE DIED, NO EMPLOYER-EMPLOYEE RELATIONSHIP EXISTED BETWEEN THE DECEASED AND HEREIN PETITIONERS.IVTHE HONORABLE APPELLATE COURT GRAVELY ERRED IN CONCLUDING THAT THE DEATH OF RESPONDENT'S SPOUSE WAS WORK RELATED DESPITE THE ABSENCE OF EVIDENCE TO PROVE THIS FINDINGS.VTHE HONORABLE COURT OF APPEALS SERIOUSLY ERRED IN SETTING ASIDE THE TWIN RESOLUTIONS DATED JANUARY 24, 2008 AND MAY 31, 2008, BASED SOLELY ON THE ARGUMENTS AND UNSUBSTANTIATED ALLEGATIONS OF THE RESPONDENT INSTEAD OF THE EVIDENCE ON RECORD.The present petition basically questions the appreciation of facts on the part of the CA. As a rule, only questions of law, not questions of fact, may be raised in a petition for review on certiorari under Rule 45.[6] The Court is thus generally bound by the CA's factual findings. There are, however, exceptions to the foregoing, among which is when the CA's factual findings are contrary to those of the trial court or administrative body exercising quasi-judicial functions from which the action originated.[7] The present petition falls under the exception due to the different factual findings of the Labor Arbiter, the NLRC and the CA.The first two issues raised by petitioners are technical in nature. They argue that the CA has no jurisdiction over the present case because the Resolutions of the Labor Arbiter and the NLRC have become final and executory. They claim that both resolutions have become final and executory as early as June 16, 2008, before respondent filed her petition for certiorari with the CA on June 25, 2008. Petitioner's argument is meritorious.In Aliviado v. Procter and Gamble Phils., Inc.[8] this Court has extensively discussed the finality of a judgment, thus:It is a hornbook rule that once a judgment has become final and executory, it may no longer be modified in any respect, even if the modification is meant to correct an erroneous conclusion of fact or law, and regardless of whether the modification is attempted to be made by the court rendering it or by the highest court of the land, as what remains to be done is the purely ministerial enforcement or execution of the judgment.The doctrine of finality of judgment is grounded on fundamental considerations of public policy and sound practice that at the risk of occasional errors, the judgment of adjudicating bodies must become final and executory on some definite date fixed by law. [...], the Supreme Court reiterated that the doctrine of immutability of final judgment is adhered to by necessity notwithstanding occasional errors that may result thereby, since litigations must somehow come to an end for otherwise, it would'even be more intolerable than the wrong and injustice it is designed to correct.'[9]In Mocorro, Jr. v. Ramirez,[10] we held that:A definitive final judgment, however erroneous, is no longer subject to change or revision.A decision that has acquired finality becomes immutable and unalterable. This quality of immutability precludes the modification of a final judgment, even if the modification is meant to correct erroneous conclusions of fact and law. And this postulate holds true whether the modification is made by the court that rendered it or by the highest court in the land. The orderly administration of justice requires that, at the risk of occasional errors, the judgments/resolutions of a court must reach a point of finality set by the law. The noble purpose is to write finis to dispute once and for all. This is a fundamental principle in our justice system, without which there would be no end to litigations. Utmost respect and adherence to this principle must always be maintained by those who exercise the power of adjudication. Any act, which violates such principle, must immediately be struck down. Indeed, the principle of conclusiveness of prior adjudications is not confined in its operation to the judgments of what are ordinarily known as courts, but extends to all bodies upon which judicial powers had been conferred.The only exceptions to the rule on the immutability of final judgments are (1) the correction of clerical errors, (2) the so-called nunc pro tunc entries which cause no prejudice to any party, and (3) void judgments. Nunc pro tunc judgments have been defined and characterized by the Court in the following manner:The object of a judgment nunc pro tunc is not the rendering of a new judgment and the ascertainment and determination of new rights, but is one placing in proper form on the record, the judgment that had been previously rendered, to make it speak the truth, so as to make it show what the judicial action really was, not to correct judicial errors, such as to render a judgment which the court ought to have rendered, in place of the one it did erroneously render, nor to supply nonaction by the court, however erroneous the judgment may have been. (Wilmerding vs. Corbin Banking Co., 28 South., 640, 641; 126 Ala., 268.)A nunc pro tunc entry in practice is an entry made now of something which was actually previously done, to have effect as of the former date. Its office is not to supply omitted action by the court, but to supply an omission in the record of action really had, but omitted through inadvertence or mistake. (Perkins vs. Haywood, 31 N. E., 670, 672)Section A of Rule VII of the NLRC Rules of Procedure provides that \u201cexcept as provided in Section 9 of Rule X, the decisions, resolutions or orders of the Commission shall become final and executory after ten (10) calendar days from receipt thereof by the parties. Section B of the same Rules provides that \u201cupon the expiration of the ten (10) calendar days period provided in paragraph (a) of this Section, the decision, resolution, or order shall be entered in a book of entries of judgment.\u201dTherefore, absent any TRO, the NLRC had the ministerial duty to issue an entry of judgment. What this Court finds confusing in this case is that, the entry of judgment declaring that its Resolution dated March 31, 2008 has become final and executory on June 16, 2008 is belatedly dated June 10, 2009. Based on the records, the Resolution dated January 24, 2008 of the NLRC, dismissing respondent's appeal was received by respondent on February 8, 2008. She then filed a Motion for Reconsideration on February 15, 2008. Said Motion for Reconsideration was denied by the NLRC in a Resolution dated March 31, 2008 and received by the respondent on April 29, 2008. According to the NLRC, its Resolution of March 31, 2008 became final and executory on June 16, 2008 per Entry of Judgment dated June 10, 2009. On June 25, 2008, respondent filed her petition for certiorari under Rule 65 with the CA. Clearly, applying the above-provisions of the NLRC Rules of Procedure, the case should have become final and executory on May 10, 2008 and not on June 16, 2008, as later on certified by the NLRC. In that regard, the NLRC committed a mistake.In its Resolution dated May 27, 2010, the CA explained that it resolved the issues raised by the respondent even though the decision of the NLRC had lapsed as contemplated in Section 223 of the Labor Code, on the ground that she filed on time a petition for certiorari under Rule 65 and the allegations contained therein are jurisdictional and with due process considerations, citing this Court's decision on St. Martin Funeral Home v. NLRC.[11]In St. Martin,[12] this Court explained the proper mode of appeal from the decision of the NLRC in view of the amended Section 9 of Batas Pambansa Bilang 129, a law which provides for the jurisdictions of courts. Thus,The Court is, therefore, of the considered opinion that ever since appeals from the NLRC to the Supreme Court were eliminated, the legislative intendment was that the special civil action of certiorari was and still is the proper vehicle for judicial review of decisions of the NLRC. The use of the word \u201cappeal\u201d in relation thereto and in the instances we have noted could have been lapsus plumae because appeals by certiorari and the original action for certiorari are both modes of judicial review addressed to the appellate courts. The important distinction between them, however, and with which the Court is particularly concerned here is that the special civil action of certiorari is within the concurrent original jurisdiction of this Court and the Court of Appeals; whereas to indulge in the assumption that appeals by certiorari to the Supreme Court are allowed would not subserve, but would subvert, the intention of Congress as expressed in the sponsorship speech on Senate Bill No. 1495.x x x xTherefore, all references in the amended Section 9 of BP 129 to supposed appeals from the NLRC to the Supreme Court are interpreted and hereby declared to mean and refer to petitions for certiorari under Rule 65. Consequently, all such petitions should therefore be initially filed in the Court of Appeals in strict observance of the doctrine of hiearchy of courts as the appropriate forum for the relief desired.[13]Basically, this Court, in the abovecited case ruled as to the proper court within which to file a remedy from the decisions of the NLRC. Based on the records, since the petition of herein respondent was filed before the expiration of the period within which to file a petition for certiorari under Rule 65, the CA, therefore, committed no error in not dismissing and eventually deciding the case. Necessarily, if the mode of appeal is that of a petition for review on certiorari under Rule 65, its reglementary period must be the one followed.Petitioner is, however, correct in its argument that the filing of the petition for certiorari does not interrupt the course of the principal case. Section 7 of Rule 65 provides:Sec. 7. Expediting proceedings; Injunctive relief. - The court in which the petition is filed may issue orders expediting the proceedings, and it may also grant a temporary restraining order or a writ of preliminary injunction for the preservation of the rights of the parties pending such proceedings. The petition shall not interrupt the course of the principal case unless a temporary restraining order or a writ of preliminary injunction has been issued enjoining the public respondent from further proceeding with the case.The public respondent shall proceed with the principal case within ten (10) days from the filing of a petition for certiorari with a higher court or tribunal absent a temporary restraining order or a preliminary injunction, or upon its expiration. x x xNevertheless, after careful review of the records, this Court considers the findings of fact of the Labor Arbiter, as affirmed by the NLRC, more plausible.It is indisputable that Ildefonso was previously employed by the petitioners as Second Engineer on board the vessel MV/ACX Magnolia to work for a duration of twelve (12) months pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Contract of Employment entered into by the parties on August 23, 2004, which was duly approved by the Philippine Overseas Employment Administration (POEA).Based on the records, however, Ildefonso pre-terminated his contract of employment with the petitioners when on April 9, 2005, he requested for a vacation leave effective May 2005. The said request was granted by the petitioners. Hence, Ildefonso was duly paid of all that was due him as a result of his employment and, subsequently, Ildefonso was repatriated to the Philippines on May 21, 2005.From the above findings and circumstance, it is clear that at the time of Ildefonso's repatriation, the employer-employee relationship between Ildefonso and the petitioners had already been terminated. Thus, the Labor Arbiter was correct in concluding that the terms and conditions contained in the contract of employment ceased to have force and effect, including the payment of death compensation benefits to the heirs of a seafarer who dies during the term of his contract as provided for in Section 20 (A) of the POEA Standard Employment Contract, which states:A. COMPENSATION AND BENEFITS FOR DEATH1. In case of work-related death of a seafarer during the term of his contract, the employer shall pay his beneficiaries the Philippine Currency equivalent of the amount of Fifty Thousand US Dollars (US$50,000) and an additional amount of Seven Thousand US Dollars (US$7,000) to each child under the age of twenty one (21), but not exceeding four (4) children, at the exchange rate prevailing during the time of payment.In Southeastern Shipping v. Navarra, Jr.,[14] this Court declared that in order to avail of death benefits, the death of the employee should occur during the effectivity of the employment contract. The death of a seaman during the term of employment makes the employer liable to his heirs for death compensation benefits. Once it is established that the seaman died during the effectivity of his employment contract, the employer is liable.[15] In the present case, Ildefonso died after he pre-terminated the contract of employment. That alone would have sufficed for his heirs not to be entitled for death compensation benefits.Furthermore, there is no evidence to show that Ildefonso's illness was acquired during the term of his employment with petitioners.The CA, in reversing the rulings of the Labor Arbiter and the NLRC, stated that the fact that One Shipping hired Ildefonso despite a waiver and prior knowledge of his heart ailment behooves petitioners to accept liability for said death in the course of his employment is misguided. Granting that petitioners were made aware of Ildefonso's prior heart ailment, the fact still remains that he died after the effectivity of his contract. There is even no reason given why Ildefonso asked for a pre-termination of his contract which resulted in his repatriation. To surmise that he asked for the pre-termination of his contract due to a medical condition is highly speculative and must not be considered as a fact. As found by the Labor Arbiter:In other words, there are no indications that Ildefonso was already suffering from an ailment at the time he pre-terminated his employment contract with petitioners. No proof was presented to substantiate complainant's claim that her husband suffered chest pain and difficulty in breathing. There was no report of any illness suffered by complainant's husband while on board the MV \u201cACX Magnolia\u201d. Also, upon his arrival in the Philippines on May 21, 2005, or at any time within three working days from the date of his return, there is no showing that the deceased required any medical treatment nor did he report to petitioners any ailment being suffered by him. Instead, he immediately signed up for another tour of duty, thereby indicating that he was physically fit to take on another assignment. Thus, the death of Ildefonso Pe\u00f1afiel was not compensable under the aforequoted provisions of the POEA Contract of Employment.Therefore, this Court finds no substantial evidence to prove that Ildefonso's illness which caused his death was aggravated during the term of his contract. [T]he death of a seaman several months after his repatriation for illness does not necessarily mean that: (a) the seaman died of the same illness; (b) his working conditions increased the risk of contracting the illness which caused his death; and (c) the death is compensable, unless there is some reasonable basis to support otherwise.[16]While the Court adheres to the principle of liberality in favor of the seafarer in construing the Standard Employment Contract, it cannot allow claims for compensation based on surmises. When the evidence presented negates compensability, we have no choice but to deny the claim, lest we cause injustice to the employer.[17]The law, in protecting the rights of the employees, authorizes neither oppression nor self-destruction of the employer - there may be cases where the circumstances warrant favoring labor over the interests of management but never should the scale be so tilted as to result in an injustice to the employer.[18]WHEREFORE, the Petition for Review on Certiorari under Rule 45 of the Revised Rules of Court, dated July 2, 2010 of petitioner One Shipping Corp., is hereby GRANTED. Consequently, the Court of Appeals' Decision dated October 27, 2009 and Resolution dated May 27, 2010 are hereby REVERSED and SET ASIDE, and the Decision dated September 20, 2006 of the Labor Arbiter, which was affirmed by the NLRC on January 24, 2008, is hereby REINSTATED.SO ORDERED.Velasco, Jr., (Chairperson), Villarama, Jr., Reyes, and Jardeleza, JJ., concur.[1] Penned by Associate Justice Vicente S.E.

PE\u00d1AFIEL, RESPONDENT.DECISION\nONE SHIPPING CORP., AND/OR ONE SHIPPING KABUSHIKI KAISHA/JAPAN, PETITIONER, VS. IMELDA C. PE\u00d1AFIEL, RESPONDENT.\n\nDECISION\n\nPERALTA, J.:\n\nThis is to resolve the Petition for Review on Certiorari under Rule 45 of the Revised Rules of Court, dated July 2, 2010, of petitioner One Shipping Corp., seeking the reversal of the Court of Appeals' Decision dated October 27, 2009 and Resolution dated May 27, 2010. [1]\n\nThe antecedent facts follow.\n\nPetitioner One Shipping Corp., for and in behalf of its principal One Shipping Kabushiki Kaisha/Japan, hired the late Ildefonso S. Pe\u00f1afiel as Second Engineer on board the vessel MV/ACX Magnolia with a monthly basic salary of US$1,120.00 and for a duration of twelve (12) months. Pe\u00f1afiel boarded the vessel on August 29, 2004 and died on July 2, 2005. His wife then filed for monetary claims arising from his death.\n\nRespondent alleged that while her husband Ildefonso was performing his task on board the vessel, the latter felt a throbbing pain in his chest and shortening of breath, as if he was about to fall. Thinking that the same was due to his heavy workload, Ildefonso took a rest. However, after recovering, Ildefonso allegedly informed his superior about the pain but the latter ignored him. On May 21, 2005, Ildefonso disembarked from the vessel and returned to the Philippines on the same day. Respondent claims that upon arrival, Ildefonso reported to the petitioner manning agency to ask for medical attention for his condition, but instead of being sent for post medical examination, Ildefonso was allegedly informed by the petitioners that he was already scheduled for his next deployment. Thus, Ildefonso was required to undergo the pre-employment medical examination at the PMP\u00a0 Diagnostic Center, Inc. on July 2, 2005. However, after allegedly completing the medical and laboratory examinations, Ildefonso collapsed and was immediately brought to the Philippine General Hospital where he died at 2:05 p.m. of the same day due to myocardial infarction. As a result, respondent asserts that she called up petitioner manning agency and told them about the incident hoping that she would be given the necessary benefits.\n\nPetitioners, on the other hand, admitted that they contracted the services of the late Ildefonso on August 23, 2004, to work on board MV/ ACX Magnolia for a period of twelve (12) months. However, they denied any liability for the claims of the respondent and maintained that at the time Ildefonso died on July 2, 2005, the latter was no longer an employee of the petitioners as he voluntarily terminated his employment contract with the petitioners when, on April 9, 2005, Ildefonso requested for a leave and pre-terminated his contract. Thus, he disembarked from the vessel on May 21, 2005. They also alleged that in the early part of June 2005, Ildefonso reported at petitioner's office applying for a new employment and requested that he be lined up for another vessel. Accordingly, he was advised to undergo the usual pre-employment medical examination before considering his request. Petitioners were then surprised when they learned about Ildefonso's passing.\n\nThe Labor Arbiter, [2] on September 20, 2006, dismissed the complaint for lack of merit. [3] Thus, respondent filed her appeal with the National Labor Relations Commission ( NLRC ) [4] in which the latter affirmed the decision of the Labor Arbiter on January 24, 2008. [5] Undaunted, respondent filed a petition for certiorari under Rule 65 of the Revised Rules of Court with the CA. The CA granted her petition, thus:\nWHEREFORE, the petition is GRANTED. The Resolutions dated January 24, 2008 and March 31, 2008 of the National Labor Relations Commission are REVERSED and SET ASIDE. Private respondents One Shipping Corporation and One Shipping Kabushiki Kaisha/Japan are hereby ordered to jointly and severally pay the following death benefits to petitioner Imelda C. Pe\u00f1afiel: US$50,000.00 for herself and US$21,000.00 for her three (3) minor children. The private respondents are likewise directed to solidarily pay petitioner US$1,000.00 as burial expenses. No costs.\n\nSO ORDERED.\nThe motion for reconsideration having been denied, petitioners come to this Court raising the following issues:\nASSIGNMENT OF ERRORS\n\nI\n\nWITH ALL DUE RESPECT, THE HONORABLE COURT OF APPEALS COMMITTED A SERIOUS ERROR IN LAW AND JURISPRUDENCE WHEN IT REVERSED AND SET ASIDE THE TWIN RESOLUTIONS OF THE NLRC DATED JANUARY 24, 2008 AND MARCH 31, 2008 DESPITE THE FACT THAT SAID RESOLUTIONS HAVE ATTAINED FINALITY.\n\nII\n\nTHE HONORABLE COURT OF APPEALS GRAVELY ERRED IN GRANTING RESPONDENT'S PETITION FOR CERTIORARI WITHOUT SHOWING THAT THE HONORABLE NLRC ACTED WITH GRAVE ABUSE OF DISCRETION, AMOUNTING TO LACK OF OR IN EXCESS OF JURISDICTION, WHEN IT RENDERED THE ASSAILED RESOLUTIONS OF JANUARY 24, 2008 AND MARCH 31, 2008.\n\nIII\n\nTHE HONORABLE COURT OF APPEALS ACTED ERRONEOUSLY WHEN IT FOUND THE PETITIONERS LIABLE FOR DEATH BENEFITS, NOTWITHSTANDING THE FACT THAT AT THE TIME RESPONDENT'S SPOUSE DIED, NO EMPLOYER-EMPLOYEE RELATIONSHIP EXISTED BETWEEN THE DECEASED AND HEREIN PETITIONERS.\n\nIV\n\nTHE HONORABLE APPELLATE COURT GRAVELY ERRED IN CONCLUDING THAT THE DEATH OF RESPONDENT'S SPOUSE WAS WORK RELATED DESPITE THE ABSENCE OF EVIDENCE TO PROVE THIS FINDINGS.\n\nV\n\nTHE HONORABLE COURT OF APPEALS SERIOUSLY ERRED IN SETTING ASIDE THE TWIN RESOLUTIONS DATED JANUARY 24, 2008 AND MAY 31, 2008, BASED SOLELY ON THE ARGUMENTS AND UNSUBSTANTIATED ALLEGATIONS OF THE RESPONDENT INSTEAD OF THE EVIDENCE ON RECORD.\nThe present petition basically questions the appreciation of facts on the part of the CA.\u00a0 As a rule, only questions of law, not questions of fact, may be raised in a petition for review on certiorari under Rule 45. [6] The Court is thus generally bound by the CA's factual findings. There are, however, exceptions to the foregoing, among which is when the CA's factual findings are contrary to those of the trial court or administrative body exercising quasi-judicial functions from which the action originated. [7] The present petition falls under the exception due to the different factual findings of the Labor Arbiter, the NLRC and the CA.\n\nThe first two issues raised by petitioners are technical in nature. They argue that the CA has no jurisdiction over the present case because the Resolutions of the Labor Arbiter and the NLRC have become final and executory. They claim that both resolutions have become final and executory as early as June 16, 2008, before respondent filed her petition for certiorari with the CA on June 25, 2008. Petitioner's argument is meritorious.\n\nIn Aliviado v. Procter and Gamble Phils., Inc . [8] this Court has extensively discussed the finality of a judgment, thus:\nIt is a hornbook rule that once a judgment has become final and executory, it may no longer be modified in any respect, even if the modification is meant to correct an erroneous conclusion of fact or law, and regardless of whether the modification is attempted to be made by the court rendering it or by the highest court of the land, as what remains to be done is the purely ministerial enforcement or execution of the judgment.\n\nThe doctrine of finality of judgment is grounded on fundamental considerations of public policy and sound practice that at the risk of occasional errors, the judgment of adjudicating bodies must become final and executory on some definite date fixed by law. [...], the Supreme Court reiterated that the doctrine of immutability of final judgment is adhered to by necessity notwithstanding occasional errors that may result thereby, since litigations must\u00a0 somehow\u00a0 come to\u00a0 an\u00a0 end\u00a0 for\u00a0 otherwise, it\u00a0 would\n\n'even be more intolerable than the wrong and injustice it is designed to correct.' [9]\n\nIn Mocorro, Jr. v. Ramirez , [10] we held that:\n\nA definitive final judgment, however erroneous, is no longer subject to change or revision.\n\nA decision that has acquired finality becomes immutable and unalterable. This quality of immutability precludes the modification of a final judgment, even if the modification is meant to correct erroneous conclusions of fact and law. And this postulate holds true whether the modification is made by the court that rendered it or by the highest court in the land. The orderly administration of justice requires that, at the risk of occasional errors, the judgments/resolutions of a court must reach a point of finality set by the law. The noble purpose is to write finis to dispute once and for all. This is a fundamental principle in our justice system, without which there would be no end to litigations. Utmost respect and adherence to this principle must always be maintained by those who exercise the power of adjudication. Any act, which violates such principle, must immediately be struck down. Indeed, the principle of conclusiveness of prior adjudications is not confined in its operation to the judgments of what are ordinarily known as courts, but extends to all bodies upon which judicial powers had been conferred.\n\nThe only exceptions to the rule on the immutability of final judgments are (1) the correction of clerical errors, (2) the so-called nunc pro tunc entries which cause no prejudice to any party, and (3) void judgments. Nunc pro tunc judgments have been defined and characterized by the Court in the following manner:\n\nThe object of a judgment nunc pro tunc is not the rendering of a new judgment and the ascertainment and determination of new rights, but is one placing in proper form on the record, the judgment that had been previously rendered, to make it speak the truth, so as to make it show what the judicial action really was, not to correct judicial errors, such as to render a judgment which the court ought to have rendered, in place of the one it did erroneously render, nor to supply nonaction by the court, however erroneous the judgment may have been. (Wilmerding vs. Corbin Banking Co., 28 South., 640, 641; 126 Ala., 268.)\n\nA nunc pro tunc entry in practice is an entry made now of something which was actually previously done, to have effect as of the former date. Its office is not to supply omitted action by the court, but to supply an omission in the record of action really had, but omitted through inadvertence or mistake. (Perkins vs. Haywood, 31 N. E., 670, 672)\nSection A of Rule VII of the NLRC Rules of Procedure provides that \u201cexcept as provided in Section 9 of Rule X, the decisions, resolutions or orders of the Commission shall become final and executory after ten (10) calendar days from receipt thereof by the parties. Section B of the same Rules provides that \u201cupon the expiration of the ten (10) calendar days period provided in paragraph (a) of this Section, the decision, resolution, or order shall be entered in a book of entries of judgment.\u201d\n\nTherefore, absent any TRO, the NLRC had the ministerial duty to issue an entry of judgment. What this Court finds confusing in this case is that, the entry of judgment declaring that its Resolution dated March 31, 2008 has become final and executory on June 16, 2008 is belatedly dated June 10, 2009. Based on the records, the Resolution dated January 24, 2008 of the NLRC, dismissing respondent's appeal was received by respondent on February 8, 2008. She then filed a Motion for Reconsideration on February 15, 2008. Said Motion for Reconsideration was denied by the NLRC in a Resolution dated March 31, 2008 and received by the respondent on April 29, 2008. According to the NLRC, its Resolution of March 31, 2008 became final and executory on June 16, 2008 per Entry of Judgment dated June 10, 2009. On June 25, 2008, respondent filed her petition for certiorari under Rule 65 with the CA. Clearly, applying the above-provisions of the NLRC Rules of Procedure, the case should have become final and executory on May 10, 2008 and not on June 16, 2008, as later on certified by the NLRC. In that regard, the NLRC committed a mistake.\n\nIn its Resolution dated May 27, 2010, the CA explained that it resolved the issues raised by the respondent even though the decision of the NLRC had lapsed as contemplated in Section 223 of the Labor Code, on the ground that she filed on time a petition for certiorari under Rule 65 and the allegations contained therein are jurisdictional and with due process considerations, citing this Court's decision on St. Martin Funeral Home v. NLRC . [11]\n\nIn St. Martin , [12] this Court explained the proper mode of appeal from the decision of the NLRC in view of the amended Section 9 of Batas Pambansa Bilang 129, a law which provides for the jurisdictions of courts. Thus,\nThe Court is, therefore, of the considered opinion that ever since appeals from the NLRC to the Supreme Court were eliminated, the legislative intendment was that the special civil action of certiorari was and still is the proper vehicle for judicial review of decisions of the NLRC. The use of the word \u201cappeal\u201d in relation thereto and in the instances we have noted could have been lapsus plumae because appeals by certiorari and the original action for certiorari are both modes of judicial review addressed to the appellate courts. The important distinction between them, however, and with which the Court is particularly concerned here is that the special civil action of certiorari is within the concurrent original jurisdiction of this Court and the Court of Appeals; whereas to indulge in the assumption that appeals by certiorari to the Supreme Court are allowed would not subserve, but would subvert, the intention of Congress as expressed in the sponsorship speech on Senate Bill No. 1495.\n\nx x x x\n\nTherefore, all references in the amended Section 9 of BP 129 to supposed appeals from the NLRC to the Supreme Court are interpreted and hereby declared to mean and refer to petitions for certiorari under Rule 65. Consequently, all such petitions should therefore be initially filed in the Court of Appeals in strict observance of the doctrine of hiearchy of courts as the appropriate forum for the relief desired. [13]\nBasically, this Court, in the abovecited case ruled as to the proper court within which to file a remedy from the decisions of the NLRC. Based on the records, since the petition of herein respondent was filed before the expiration of the period within which to file a petition for certiorari under Rule 65, the CA, therefore, committed no error in not dismissing and eventually deciding the case. Necessarily, if the mode of appeal is that of a petition for review on certiorari under Rule 65, its reglementary period must be the one followed.\n\nPetitioner is, however, correct in its argument that the filing of the petition for certiorari does not interrupt the course of the principal case. Section 7 of Rule 65 provides:\nSec. 7. Expediting proceedings; Injunctive relief. - The court in which the petition is filed may issue orders expediting the proceedings, and it may also grant a temporary restraining order or a writ of preliminary injunction for the preservation of the rights of the parties pending such proceedings. The petition shall not interrupt the course of the principal case unless a temporary restraining order or a writ of preliminary injunction has been issued enjoining the public respondent from further proceeding with the case.\n\nThe public respondent shall proceed with the principal case within ten (10) days from the filing of a petition for certiorari with a higher court or tribunal absent a temporary restraining order or a preliminary injunction, or upon its expiration. x x x\nNevertheless, after careful review of the records, this Court considers the findings of fact of the Labor Arbiter, as affirmed by the NLRC, more plausible.\n\nIt is indisputable that Ildefonso was previously employed by the petitioners as Second Engineer on board the vessel MV/ACX Magnolia to work for a duration of twelve (12) months pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Contract of Employment entered into by the parties on August 23, 2004, which was duly approved by the Philippine Overseas Employment Administration (POEA).\n\nBased on the records, however, Ildefonso pre-terminated his contract of employment with the petitioners when on April 9, 2005, he requested for a vacation leave effective May 2005. The said request was granted by the petitioners. Hence, Ildefonso was duly paid of all that was due him as a result of his employment and, subsequently, Ildefonso was repatriated to the Philippines on May 21, 2005.\n\nFrom the above findings and circumstance, it is clear that at the time of Ildefonso's repatriation, the employer-employee relationship between Ildefonso and the petitioners had already been terminated. Thus, the Labor Arbiter was correct in concluding that the terms and conditions contained in the contract of employment ceased to have force and effect, including the payment of death compensation benefits to the heirs of a seafarer who dies during the term of his contract as provided for in Section 20 (A) of the POEA Standard Employment Contract, which states:\nA. COMPENSATION AND BENEFITS FOR DEATH\n\n1. In case of work-related death of a seafarer during the term of his contract, the employer shall pay his beneficiaries the Philippine Currency equivalent of the amount of Fifty Thousand US Dollars (US$50,000) and an additional amount of Seven Thousand US Dollars (US$7,000) to each child under the age of twenty one (21), but not exceeding four (4) children, at the exchange rate prevailing during the time of payment.\nIn Southeastern Shipping v. Navarra, Jr. , [14] this Court declared that in order to avail of death benefits, the death of the employee should occur during the effectivity of the employment contract. The death of a seaman during the term of employment makes the employer liable to his heirs for death compensation benefits. Once it is established that the seaman died during the effectivity of his employment contract, the employer is liable. [15] In the present case, Ildefonso died after he pre-terminated the contract of employment. That alone would have sufficed for his heirs not to be entitled for death compensation benefits.\n\nFurthermore, there is no evidence to show that Ildefonso's illness was acquired during the term of his employment with petitioners.\n\nThe CA, in reversing the rulings of the Labor Arbiter and the NLRC, stated that the fact that One Shipping hired Ildefonso despite a waiver and prior knowledge of his heart ailment behooves petitioners to accept liability for said death in the course of his employment is misguided. Granting that petitioners were made aware of Ildefonso's prior heart ailment, the fact still remains that he died after the effectivity of his contract. There is even no reason given why Ildefonso asked for a pre-termination of his contract which resulted in his repatriation. To surmise that he asked for the pre-termination of his contract due to a medical condition is highly speculative and must not be considered as a fact. As found by the Labor Arbiter:\nIn other words, there are no indications that Ildefonso was already suffering from an ailment at the time he pre-terminated his employment contract with petitioners. No proof was presented to substantiate complainant's claim that her husband suffered chest pain and difficulty in breathing. There was no report of any illness suffered by complainant's husband while on board the MV \u201cACX Magnolia\u201d. Also, upon his arrival in the Philippines on May 21, 2005, or at any time within three working days from the date of his return, there is no showing that the deceased required any medical treatment nor did he report to petitioners any ailment being suffered by him. Instead, he immediately signed up for another tour of duty, thereby indicating that he was physically fit to take on another assignment. Thus, the death of Ildefonso Pe\u00f1afiel was not compensable under the aforequoted provisions of the POEA Contract of Employment.\nTherefore, this Court finds no substantial evidence to prove that Ildefonso's illness which caused his death was aggravated during the term of his contract. [T]he death of a seaman several months after his repatriation for illness does not necessarily mean that: (a) the seaman died of the same illness; (b) his working conditions increased the risk of contracting the illness which caused his death; and (c) the death is compensable, unless there is some reasonable basis to support otherwise. [16]\n\nWhile the Court adheres to the principle of liberality in favor of the seafarer in construing the Standard Employment Contract, it cannot allow claims for compensation based on surmises. When the evidence presented negates compensability, we have no choice but to deny the claim, lest we cause injustice to the employer. [17]\n\nThe law, in protecting the rights of the employees, authorizes neither oppression nor self-destruction of the employer - there may be cases where the circumstances warrant favoring labor over the interests of management but never should the scale be so tilted as to result in an injustice to the employer.

      "title": "SPOUSES ANTHONY L. NGO AND SO HON K. NGO AND SPOUSES LUIS M. LITAM, JR. AND LUZVIMINDA C. LITAM, PETITIONERS, VS. ALLIED BANKING CORPORATION, RESPONDENT. D E C I S I O N NACHURA, J.: Assailed in this petition for review on certiorari[1] are the April 19, 2006 Decision[2] and the April 2, 2007 Resolution[3] of the Court of Appeals (CA), which lifted the writ of preliminary mandatory injunction issued on October 1,2002[4] by the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Quezon City, Branch 98.The facts:In a Complaint for Damages with prayer for the issuance of a Preliminary Mandatory Injunction[5] filed with the RTC onMay 9, 2002, petitioner-spouses alleged in the main that Allied Banking Corporation (Allied Bank) unlawfully and unjustifiably refused to discharge/release the real estate mortgage constituted on the two lots of spouses Anthony Ngo and So Hon Ngo, and withheld the Owner's Duplicate Copy of the Transfer Certificate of Title (TCT) of the said lots, despite spouses Ngo's full payment of the P12 million loan secured by the mortgage.Petitioners averred that the funds used by spouses Ngo in paying for the loan were the proceeds of the sale of the lots to spouses Luis Litam, Jr. and Luzviminda Litam; and that the sale was known to and permitted by Allied Bank through its Manager, Rodolfo Jose.[6] The bank, however, vehemently denied giving its imprimatur to the sale.[7]Allied Bank admitted the satisfaction of the P12 million loan but clarified that the real estate mortgage on the lots still secures the unpaid P42,900,000.00 loan of Civic Merchandising, Inc., for which Anthony Ngo stands as a surety. In support thereof, the bank presented the Continuing Guaranty/Comprehensive Surety Agreement executed by Anthony Ngo, both in his personal capacity and as the company's president and general manager.On October 1,2002, after hearing the parties, the RTC ordered the issuance of a writ of preliminary injunction, directing Allied Bank to discharge the real estate mortgage constituted on the subject properties, and to release to spouses Ngo the owner's copy of the TCTs of the lots. [8]When its motion for reconsideration[9] of the foregoing order was denied,[10] Allied Bank elevated the incident to the CA by way of a special civil action for certiorari.On April 19, 2006, the CA annulled the RTC's orders upon finding that petitioner-spouses failed to establish a clear and unmistakable right to warrant the issuance of the provisional injunctive writ against Allied Bank.[11] This was affirmed in its April 02,2007 Resolution[12] denying petitioner-spouses' motion for reconsideration.Aggrieved, petitioner-spouses interposed the instant recourse, ascribing the following errors to the CA:I. THE HONORABLE COURT OF APPEALS ERRED IN RULING THAT THE REAL ESTATE MORTGAGE EXECUTED BY SPS. NGO SECURED THE CREDIT ACCOMODATION OF CIVIC MERCHANDISING, INC.II. THE HONORABLE COURT OF APPEALS ERRED IN RULING THAT THE PETITIONERS FAILED TO ESTABLISH A CLEAR AND UNMISTAKABLE RIGHT INVADED BY THE RESPONDENT TO WARRANT THE ISSUANCE OF THE WRIT OF PRELIMINARY MANDATORY INJUNCTION.[13]The petition lacks merit.Section 3, Rule 58 of the 1997 Revised Rules of Civil Procedure provides that a writ of preliminary injunction, whether mandatory or prohibitory, may be granted if the following requisites are met: (1) The applicant must have a clear and unmistakable right, that is a right in esse; (2) There is a material and substantial invasion of such right; (3) There is an urgent need to issue the writ in order to prevent irreparable injury to the applicant; and (4) No other ordinary, speedy, and adequate remedy exists to prevent the infliction of irreparable injury.[14]A preliminary mandatory injunction is more cautiously regarded than a mere prohibitive injunction since, more than its function of preserving the status quo between the parties, it also commands the performance of an act.[15] Accordingly, the issuance of a writ of preliminary mandatory injunction is justified only in a clear case, free from doubt or dispute.[16] When the complainant's right is doubtful or disputed, he does not have a clear legal right and, therefore, the issuance of a writ of preliminary mandatory injunction is improper.[17] While it is not required that the right claimed by applicant, as basis for seeking injunctive relief, be conclusively established, it is still necessary to show, at least tentatively, that the right exists and is not vitiated by any substantial challenge or contradiction.[18]Petitioner-spouses-anchored their right to an injunctive writ on Payment Slip No. 160989, issued by Allied Bank, evidencing their full payment of the P12 million loan on February 26,2002. Such payment, according to spouses Ngo, vested in them the right to demand: (1) the release/cancellation of the real estate mortgage securing such debt; and (2) the return of the owner's copy of the TCTs of the subject lots so they can cause the transfer thereof to their buyers, spouses Litam.The bank, on the other hand, admitted the settlement of the P12 million loan, but insisted that the real estate mortgage executed by spouses Ngo also covers the subsisting P42,900,000.00 loan extended to Civic Merchandising, Inc., which is secured by a suretyship agreement assumed by Anthony Ngo. In support thereof, Allied Bank emphasized the following provisions of the real estate mortgage: That, for and consideration of credit accommodations obtained from the MORTGAGEE, detailed as follows:Nature Amount or LineLOAN LINEP10,000,000.00and to secure the payment of the same and all other obligations of the MORTGAGOR to the MORTGAGEE of whatever kind and nature, whether such obligations have been contracted before, during or after the constitution and execution of this mortgage, including interest and expenses or any other obligation owing to the MORTGAGEE whether direct or indirect, principal or secondary, as appears in the accounts, books and records of the MORTGAGEE, the MORTGAGOR does hereby transfer and convey by way of mortgage unto the MORTGAGEE, its successors or assigns, the parcels of land which are described in the list inserted on the back of this document and/or appended hereto, together with all the buildings and improvements now existing or which may hereafter be erected or constructed thereon, of which the MORTGAGOR declares that he/it is the absolute owner free from liens and encumbrances.[19]Allied Bank also pointed out the complementary terms of the Continuing Guaranty/Comprehensive Surety Agreement signed by Anthony Ngo, viz.: II. As security for and all indebtedness of obligations of the undersigned to you now existing or hereafter arising hereunder or otherwise, you are hereby given the right to retain, and you are hereby given a lien upon, all money or other property, and/or proceeds thereof, which have been or may hereafter be deposited or left with you (or with any third party acting on your behalf) by or for the account or credit of the undersigned, including (without limitation of the foregoing) that in safekeeping or in which the undersigned may have any interest.[20]In granting petitioners' application for a preliminary mandatory injunction, the RTC reasoned in this manner:It is undisputed that the real estate mortgage annotated at the dorsal portion of TCT Nos. 81647 and 81648 had already been paid by [petitioners] Ngo as of February 26, 2002. The original obligation having been paid, it becomes the duty of the [respondent] to release the title of the properties and to cancel the real estate mortgage.[21]Generally, a trial court's decision to grant or to deny injunctive relief will not be set aside on appeal unless the court abused its discretion. In granting or denying injunctive relief, a court abuses its discretion when it lacks jurisdiction, fails to consider and make a record of the factors relevant to its determination, relies on clearly erroneous factual findings, considers clearly irrelevant or improper factors, clearly gives too much weight to one factor, relies on erroneous conclusions of law or equity, or misapplies its factual or legal conclusions.[22]In this case, the mere fact of payment of the P12 million loan is a scant justification for the issuance of the writ. The RTC accorded too much weight thereon and deliberately ignored other relevant facts alleged in the pleadings and shown in the annexes submitted by the parties, specifically the real estate mortgage and the Continuing Guaranty/Comprehensive Surety Agreement. The covenants contained in the said agreements, coupled with the bank's categorical denial that it permitted the sale of the mortgaged properties to spouses Litam, cast serious doubts on, and pose a substantial challenge against, the rights claimed by petitioner-spouses.Contrary to the RTC's ruling, the rights claimed by petitioners are less than clear and far from being unmistakable. Consequently, without such unequivocal right, the possibility of irreparable damage would not justify injuctive relief in petitioner's favor. In addition, the possibility of damage to petitioners is remote compared to the immediate and serious injury that respondent will suffer if the writ implemented. In this regard, we quote with approval the ensuing pronouncement of the CA:Neither is there an urgent and paramount necessity for the writ to prevent serious damage to the spouse Ngo and Litam. Actually, it is the [respondent] who stands to suffer great damage and injury, as it stands to lose its security on a P42,900,000.00 loan, exclusive of interest and penalties, if the writ is implemented.[23] Further, in issuing the preliminary mandatory injunction, which was the main prayer in the complaint, the RTC effectively concluded the main case without proper hearing on the merits as there was practically nothing left to be determined except petitioner-spouses' claim for damages. Settled is the rule that courts should avoid issuing a writ of preliminary injunction which would in effect dispose of the main case without trial.[24]Accordingly, we hold that the RTC improperly issued the writ of preliminary injunction and the CA was correct in annulling the same. However, the CA erred in declaring that \"the mortgage over the properties, secured not merely the credit accommodation in the amount of P12,000,000.00, but likewise the credit accommodation of Civic Merchandising and the latter's outstanding liability in the amount of P42,900,000.00. \" It is a prejudgment of the main case, and a premature acceptance of a proposition which petitioners are still bound to prove in a full-blown trial. As discussed above, the credit accommodation given to Civic Merchandising, Inc. casts a cloud of doubt over the rights claimed by petitioners. But such doubt merely precluded the issuance of an injunctive writ; it did not conclusively establish that the real estate mortgage, indeed, also secured Civic Merchandising, Inc.'s loan. This notwithstanding, the resulting disposition arrived at by the CA is still correct and we concur therewith.WHEREFORE, premises considered, the Petition is hereby DENIED and the assailed April 19, 2006 Decision and the April 2, 2007 Resolution of the Court of Appeals are AFFIRMED.SO ORDERED.Velasco, Jr.,**Peralta, Mendoza, and Sereno, ***JJ., concur. * In lieu of Associate Justice Antonio T.

ALLIED BANKING CORPORATION, RESPONDENT.\n\nD E C I S I O N\n\nNACHURA, J.:\n\nAssailed in this petition for review on certiorari [1] are the April 19, 2006 Decision [2] and the April 2, 2007 Resolution [3] of the Court of Appeals (CA), which lifted the writ of preliminary mandatory injunction issued on October 1,2002 [4] by the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Quezon City, Branch 98.\n\nThe facts:\n\nIn a Complaint for Damages with prayer for the issuance of a Preliminary Mandatory Injunction [5] filed with the RTC on\n\nMay 9, 2002, petitioner-spouses alleged in the main that Allied Banking Corporation (Allied Bank) unlawfully and unjustifiably refused to discharge/release the real estate mortgage constituted on the two lots of spouses Anthony Ngo and So Hon Ngo, and withheld the Owner's Duplicate Copy of the Transfer Certificate of Title (TCT) of the said lots, despite spouses Ngo's full payment of the P12 million loan secured by the mortgage.\n\nPetitioners averred that the funds used by spouses Ngo in paying for the loan were the proceeds of the sale of the lots to spouses Luis Litam, Jr. and Luzviminda Litam; and that the sale was known to and permitted by Allied Bank through its Manager, Rodolfo Jose. [6] The bank, however, vehemently denied giving its imprimatur to the sale. [7]\n\nAllied Bank admitted the satisfaction of the P12 million loan but clarified that the real estate mortgage on the lots still secures the unpaid P42,900,000.00 loan of Civic Merchandising, Inc., for which Anthony Ngo stands as a surety. In support thereof, the bank presented the Continuing Guaranty/Comprehensive Surety Agreement executed by Anthony Ngo, both in his personal capacity and as the company's president and general manager.\n\nOn October 1,2002, after hearing the parties, the RTC ordered the issuance of a writ of preliminary injunction, directing Allied Bank to discharge the real estate mortgage constituted on the subject properties, and to release to spouses Ngo the owner's copy of the TCTs of the lots. [8]\n\nWhen its motion for reconsideration [9] of the foregoing order was denied, [10] Allied Bank elevated the incident to the CA by way of a special civil action for certiorari .\n\nOn April 19, 2006, the CA annulled the RTC's orders upon finding that petitioner-spouses failed to establish a clear and unmistakable right to warrant the issuance of the provisional injunctive writ against Allied Bank. [11] This was affirmed in its April 02,2007 Resolution [12] denying petitioner-spouses' motion for reconsideration.\n\nAggrieved, petitioner-spouses interposed the instant recourse, ascribing the following errors to the CA:\n\nI.\n\nTHE HONORABLE COURT OF APPEALS ERRED IN RULING THAT THE REAL ESTATE MORTGAGE EXECUTED BY SPS. NGO SECURED THE CREDIT ACCOMODATION OF CIVIC MERCHANDISING, INC.\n\nII.\n\nTHE HONORABLE COURT OF APPEALS ERRED IN RULING THAT THE PETITIONERS FAILED TO ESTABLISH A CLEAR AND UNMISTAKABLE RIGHT INVADED BY THE RESPONDENT TO WARRANT THE ISSUANCE OF THE WRIT OF PRELIMINARY MANDATORY INJUNCTION. [13]\n\nThe petition lacks merit.\n\nSection 3, Rule 58 of the 1997 Revised Rules of Civil Procedure provides that a writ of preliminary injunction, whether mandatory or prohibitory, may be granted if the following requisites are met:\n\n(1) The applicant must have a clear and unmistakable right, that is a right in esse ;\n\n(2) There is a material and substantial invasion of such right;\n\n(3) There is an urgent need to issue the writ in order to prevent irreparable injury to the applicant; and\n\n(4) No other ordinary, speedy, and adequate remedy exists to prevent the infliction of irreparable injury. [14]\n\nA preliminary mandatory injunction is more cautiously regarded than a mere prohibitive injunction since, more than its function of preserving the status quo between the parties, it also commands the performance of an act. [15] Accordingly, the issuance of a writ of preliminary mandatory injunction is justified only in a clear case, free from doubt or dispute. [16] When the complainant's right is doubtful or disputed, he does not have a clear legal right and, therefore, the issuance of a writ of preliminary mandatory injunction is improper. [17] While it is not required that the right claimed by applicant, as basis for seeking injunctive relief, be conclusively established, it is still necessary to show, at least tentatively, that the right exists and is not vitiated by any substantial challenge or contradiction. [18]\n\nPetitioner-spouses-anchored their right to an injunctive writ on Payment Slip No. 160989, issued by Allied Bank, evidencing their full payment of the P12 million loan on February 26,2002. Such payment, according to spouses Ngo, vested in them the right to demand: (1) the release/cancellation of the real estate mortgage securing such debt; and (2) the return of the owner's copy of the TCTs of the subject lots so they can cause the transfer thereof to their buyers, spouses Litam.\n\nThe bank, on the other hand, admitted the settlement of the P12 million loan, but insisted that the real estate mortgage executed by spouses Ngo also covers the subsisting P42,900,000.00 loan extended to Civic Merchandising, Inc., which is secured by a suretyship agreement assumed by Anthony Ngo. In support thereof, Allied Bank emphasized the following provisions of the real estate mortgage:\n\nThat, for and consideration of credit accommodations obtained from the MORTGAGEE, detailed as follows:\n\n[TABLE_CONTENT]\nNature | Amount or Line\nLOAN LINE | P10,000,000.00\n[END_TABLE]\n\nNature Amount or Line LOAN LINE P10,000,000.00\n\nand to secure the payment of the same and all other obligations of the MORTGAGOR to the MORTGAGEE of whatever kind and nature, whether such obligations have been contracted before, during or after the constitution and execution of this mortgage, including interest and expenses or any other obligation owing to the MORTGAGEE whether direct or indirect, principal or secondary, as appears in the accounts, books and records of the MORTGAGEE , the MORTGAGOR does hereby transfer and convey by way of mortgage unto the MORTGAGEE, its successors or assigns, the parcels of land which are described in the list inserted on the back of this document and/or appended hereto, together with all the buildings and improvements now existing or which may hereafter be erected or constructed thereon, of which the MORTGAGOR declares that he/it is the absolute owner free from liens and encumbrances. [19]\n\nAllied Bank also pointed out the complementary terms of the Continuing Guaranty/Comprehensive Surety Agreement signed by Anthony Ngo, viz. :\n\nII. As security for and all indebtedness of obligations of the undersigned to you now existing or hereafter arising hereunder or otherwise, you are hereby given the right to retain, and you are hereby given a lien upon, all money or other property, and/or proceeds thereof, which have been or may hereafter be deposited or left with you (or with any third party acting on your behalf) by or for the account or credit of the undersigned, including (without limitation of the foregoing) that in safekeeping or in which the undersigned may have any interest. [20]\n\nIn granting petitioners' application for a preliminary mandatory injunction, the RTC reasoned in this manner:\n\nIt is undisputed that the real estate mortgage annotated at the dorsal portion of TCT Nos. 81647 and 81648 had already been paid by [petitioners] Ngo as of February 26, 2002. The original obligation having been paid, it becomes the duty of the [respondent] to release the title of the properties and to cancel the real estate mortgage. [21]\n\nGenerally, a trial court's decision to grant or to deny injunctive relief will not be set aside on appeal unless the court abused its discretion. In granting or denying injunctive relief, a court abuses its discretion when it lacks jurisdiction, fails to consider and make a record of the factors relevant to its determination, relies on clearly erroneous factual findings, considers clearly irrelevant or improper factors, clearly gives too much weight to one factor, relies on erroneous conclusions of law or equity, or misapplies its factual or legal conclusions. [22]\n\nIn this case, the mere fact of payment of the P12 million loan is a scant justification for the issuance of the writ. The RTC accorded too much weight thereon and deliberately ignored other relevant facts alleged in the pleadings and shown in the annexes submitted by the parties, specifically the real estate mortgage and the Continuing Guaranty/Comprehensive Surety Agreement.

COURT OF APPEALS, CITY OF MANILA MAYOR ALFREDO LIM, VICE MAYOR LITO ATIENZA, CITY COUNCIL OF MANILA, AND CITY TREASURER ANTHONY ACEVEDO, RESPONDENTS.D E C I S I O N LEONARDO-DE CASTRO, J.: Before the Court are 10 consolidated Petitions, the issue at the crux of which is the constitutionality and/or validity of Section 21(B) of Ordinance No. 7794 of the City of Manila, otherwise known as the Revenue Code of the City of Manila (Manila Revenue Code), as amended by Ordinance No. 7807.[2]IANTECEDENT FACTSThe Manila Revenue Code was enacted on June 22, 1993 by the City Council of Manila and approved on June 29, 1993 by then Manila Mayor Alfredo S. Lim (Lim). Section 21(B) of said Code originally provided:Section 21. Tax on Businesses Subject to the Excise, Value-Added or Percentage Taxes Under the NIRC. \u2013 On any of the following businesses and articles of commerce subject to the excise, value-added or percentage taxes under the National Internal Revenue Code, hereinafter referred to as NIRC, as amended, a tax of three percent (3%) per annum on the gross sales or receipts of the preceding calendar year is hereby imposed:x x x xB) On the gross receipts of keepers of garages, cars for rent or hire driven by the lessee, transportation contractors, persons who transport passenger or freight for hire, and common carriers by land, air or water, except owners of bancas and owners of animal-drawn two-wheel vehicle.Shortly thereafter, Ordinance No. 7807 was enacted by the City Council of Manila on September 27, 1993 and approved by Mayor Lim on September 29, 1993, already amending several provisions of the Manila Revenue Code. Section 21 of the Manila Revenue Code, as amended, imposed a lower tax rate on the businesses that fell under it, and paragraph (B) thereof read as follows:Section 21. Tax on Business Subject to the Excise, Value-Added or Percentage Taxes Under the NIRC \u2013 On any of the following businesses and articles of commerce subject to the excise, value-added or percentage taxes under the National Internal Revenue Code hereinafter referred to as NIRC, as amended, a tax of FIFTY PERCENT (50%) OF ONE PERCENT (1%) per annum on the gross sales or receipts of the preceding calendar year is hereby imposed:x x x xB) On the gross receipts of keepers of garages, cars for rent or hire driven by the lessee, transportation contractors, persons who transport passenger or freight for hire, and common carriers by land, air or water, except owners of bancas and owners of animal-drawn two-wheel vehicle.The City of Manila, through its City Treasurer, began imposing and collecting the business tax under Section 21(B) of the Manila Revenue Code, as amended, beginning January 1994.G.R. No. 120051Malaysian Airline System (MAS) is a foreign corporation organized and existing under the laws of Malaysia. It is licensed to engage in business in the Philippines by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), particularly in the airline business which involves the transportation of passengers and cargo for hire. Its principal office and place of business in the Philippines is located in the City of Manila.As MAS was renewing its business permit for 1994, it was assessed by the City Treasurer of Manila on January 17, 1994 for the following taxes and fees: Mayor\u2019s permit and regulatory fees P 10,307.50 Municipal license tax or business tax 1,100,000.00 Total P 1,110,307.50[3] MAS, believing that it was exempt from the municipal license tax or business tax, tendered, via Far East Bank and Trust Company (FEBTC) Check No. 06564 dated January 19, 1994, only the amount of P10,307.50 for the mayor\u2019s permit and regulatory fees. The City Treasurer of Manila refused to accept FEBTC Check No. 06564.Consequently, on January 20, 1994, MAS instituted Civil Case No. 94-69052, to consign with the trial court the amount of P10,307.50 for mayor\u2019s permit and regulatory fees; to challenge the assessment against it by the City Treasurer of Manila in the amount of P1,100,000.00 for municipal license tax or business tax; and to have Section 21(B) of the Manila Revenue Code, as amended, on which said assessment for municipal license tax or business tax was based, be declared invalid or null and void. Civil Case No. 94-69052 was assigned to the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Manila, Branch 43.On April 3, 1995, RTC-Branch 43 rendered a Decision[4] in favor of MAS. The dispositive portion of said Decision reads:WHEREFORE, the foregoing disquisitions considered, judgment is hereby rendered in favor of the plaintiff against the defendants:Declaring the consignation valid and made in accordance with law;Ordering defendants to issue to plaintiff the mayor\u2019s permit or permit to operate for 1994, the necessary certificates and official receipts evidencing payment of [plaintiff\u2019s] liabilities for mayor\u2019s permit fee and other regulatory fees for 1994; and,Declaring Section 21(B) of Ordinance No. 7794, as amended by Ordinance No. 7807, of the City of Manila as invalid or null and void insofar as it imposes a business tax on transportation contractors, persons engaged in the transportation of passengers or freight by hire and common carriers by air, land or water, or that plaintiff is exempt from the tax imposed by said section 21(B).Declaring plaintiff\u2019s obligation to the defendant City of Manila for mayor\u2019s permit fee and other regulatory fees for 1994 as having been paid and extinguished without any liability for surcharges, interests or any additional amount whatsoever.Not having been proven, the prayer for the payment of attorney\u2019s fees is denied.No pronouncement as to costs.[5]The City of Manila, Mayor Lim, and City Treasurer Anthony Y. Acevedo (Acevedo) filed with the Court a Petition for Review on Certiorari,[6] assailing the Decision dated April 3, 1995 of RTC-Branch 43 in Civil Case No. 94-69052 based on pure questions of law. They assigned the following errors on the part of RTC-Branch 43:4.1. That the trial court erred in declaring Section 21(B) of [the Manila Revenue Code, as amended,] as invalid or null and void.4.2. That the trial court erred in declaring the consignation valid and made in accordance with law.[7]The City of Manila, Mayor Lim, and City Treasurer Acevedo prayed in their Petition that the Court (1) reverse and set aside the assailed RTC Decision; and (2) affirm the constitutionality and validity of Section 21(B) of the Manila Revenue Code, as amended. The Petition was docketed as G.R. No. 120051.MAS filed its Comment,[8] to which the City of Manila, Mayor Lim, and City Treasurer Acevedo filed their Reply.[9]G.R. No. 121613Because they were assessed and/or compelled to pay business taxes pursuant to Section 21(B) of the Manila Revenue Code, as amended, before they were issued their business permits for 1994, several corporations, with principal offices in Manila and operating as \u201ctransportation contractors, persons who transport passenger or freight for hire, and common carriers by land, air or water,\u201d filed their respective petitions before the Manila RTC against the City of Manila, Mayor Lim, Vice Mayor Lito Atienza (Atienza), the City Council of Manila/Sangguniang Panlungsod ng Maynila, and City Treasurer Acevedo. Said petitions were separately docketed and raffled to different RTC Branches, to wit: Civil Case No. Petitioner RTC-Branch No. 94-68861 Maersk Filipinas, Inc. (Maersk) 32 94-68862 American President Lines, Ltd. (APL) 33 94-68863 Sea-Land Services, Inc. (Sea-Land) 34 94-68919 Overseas Freighters Shipping, Inc. (OFSI) 55 94-68936 Dongnama Shipping Co., Ltd. (Dongnama) and Kyowa Shipping, Ltd. (Kyowa) 47 94-68939 Flagship Tankers Corp. (Flagship Tankers) 21 94-68940 Core Indo Maritime Corp. (CIMC) 21 94-68941 Core Maritime Corp. (CMC) 21 94-69028[10] Eastern Shipping Lines, Inc. (Eastern Shipping) All of the aforementioned cases were later consolidated before RTC-Branch 32.Several more corporations with principal offices in Manila and engaged in the same line of business as the above-named petitioner corporations filed petitions/complaints-in-intervention in the pending cases, namely: William Lines, Inc. (William Lines); Negros Navigation Co., Inc. (Negros Navigation); Lorenzo Shipping Corp. (Lorenzo Shipping); Carlos A. Gothong Lines, Inc. (Gothong Lines); Aboitiz Shipping Corp., Aboitiz Air Transport Corp., and Aboitiz Haulers, Inc. (collectively referred to as the Aboitiz Group); Solid Shipping Lines Corp. (Solid Shipping); and PNOC Shipping & Transport Corp. (PSTC).Petitioner and intervenor corporations essentially sought the (1) declaration of Section 21(B) of the Manila Revenue Code, as amended, as void/invalid for being contrary to the Constitution and the Local Government Code (LGC) of 1991; (2) refund of the business taxes that the petitioner and intervenor corporations paid under protest; and (3) the issuance of a temporary restraining order (TRO), writ of preliminary injunction, writ of prohibition, and/or writ of permanent injunction to enjoin the implementation of Section 21(B) of the Manila Revenue Code, as amended.RTC-Branch 32 issued a TRO[11] on January 14, 1994 in favor of petitioners Maersk, APL, Flagship Tankers, CIMC, and CMC. The TRO was effective for 20 days and ordered respondent City of Manila and local officials to cease and desist from implementing Section 21(B) of the Manila Revenue Code, as amended, while the prayer for a writ of preliminary injunction was scheduled for presentation of evidence. On February 3, 1992, after hearing, RTC-Branch 32 issued an Order granting the prayer of petitioners Maersk, APL, Flagship Tankers, CIMC, CMC, and OFSI for the issuance of a Writ of Preliminary Injunction,[12] with the condition that each of said petitioner corporations should post an injunction bond in the amount of P50,000.00. The Writ of Preliminary Injunction enjoined respondent City of Manila and local officials from: (1) imposing, enforcing, assessing, and collecting the taxes under Section 21(B) of the Manila Revenue Code, as amended; and (2) denying to petitioners Maersk, APL, Flagship Tankers, CIMC, CMC, and OFSI their business permits and licenses for 1994. In another Order dated April 22, 1994, RTC-Branch 32 granted the prayer of intervenor corporations for the issuance of a similar Writ of Preliminary Injunction.In its Decision[13] dated August 28, 1995 in Civil Case Nos. 94-68861, 94-68862, 94-68863, 94-68919, 94-68936, 94-68939, 94-68940, 94-68941, and 94-69028, RTC-Branch 32 upheld the power of the respondent City of Manila, as a local government unit (LGU), to levy the business tax under Section 21(B) of the Manila Revenue Code, as amended, consistent with the basic policy of local autonomy. Ultimately, RTC-Branch 32 decreed:WHEREFORE, the petitions, the supplemental petitions, and the petitions or complaints in intervention in all these cases are DISMISSED.All temporary restraining orders are cancelled, all writs of preliminary injunction are recalled and dissolved, and the injunction bonds cancelled.[14]Maersk, APL, Flagship Tankers, CIMC, and CMC (collectively referred to herein as Maersk, et al.,), filed a direct appeal before the Court. Initially, Maersk, et al.,, filed a motion for extension of time to file their petition for review on certiorari. Upon filing of said motion, they were assessed docket and legal fees in the amount of P420.00, which they fully paid. The motion for extension of time was granted by the Court in a Resolution[15] dated October 4, 1995. Within the extended period, Maersk, et al.,, filed their Petition for Review on Certiorari with prayer for issuance of a writ of preliminary injunction and TRO,[16] docketed as G.R. No. 121613, naming RTC-Branch 32, the City of Manila, Mayor Lim, Vice Mayor Atienza, the Sangguniang Panlungsod ng Maynila, and City Treasurer Acevedo, as respondents. Maersk, et al.,, submitted for resolution by the Court a lone question of law, viz.:Whether or not Section 21(B) of Ordinance No. 7794, otherwise known as the Revenue Code of the City of Manila, as amended by Section 1(G) of Ordinance No. 7807, is valid and constitutional.[17]Meanwhile, Maersk, et al.,, also filed with RTC-Branch 32 a Motion to Stay or Restore Writ of Preliminary Injunction, presenting a Memorandum issued by City Treasurer Acevedo already ordering the collection of the business tax under Section 21(B) of the Manila Revenue Code, as amended. In an Order[18] dated October 16, 1995, RTC-Branch 32 granted the Motion of Maersk, et al.,, after finding the same to be meritorious and in conformity with Rule 39, Section 4 of the Rules of Court, on the condition that Maersk, et al.,, would increase their injunction bond from P50,000.00 each to P800,000.00 each, or for a total of P4,000,000.00. With this latest development, Maersk, et al.,, filed with the Court a Supplemental Petition and Motion praying for the confirmation of the RTC Order dated October 16, 1995 restoring the Writ of Preliminary Injunction and deletion of the name of RTC-Branch 32 from the caption of the Petition in G.R. No. 121613 as the trial court is not a necessary party.On October 23, 1995 though, the Court issued a Resolution[19] in G.R. No. 121613 in which it resolved as follows:On the basis of the foregoing, the Court RESOLVED to DISMISS the petition for review on certiorari for non-compliance with the above-mentioned requirement no. 1, [Maersk, et al.,,] having failed to remit the amount of P202.00 as payment for the balance of the prescribed legal fees.Accordingly, the supplemental petition and motion of [Maersk, et al.,.,] dated October 17, 1995 praying that the lower court\u2019s order restoring the Writ of Preliminary Injunction be confirmed and that the Regional Trial Court of Manila, Branch 32, be deleted from the caption of the petition for not being a necessary party is NOTED WITHOUT ACTION.Maersk, et al.,, filed a Motion for Reconsideration[20] of the foregoing Resolution dated October 23, 1995 of the Court. Maersk, et al.,, argued that the dismissal of their Petition by minute resolution would deprive them of their property rights on mere technical grounds. Maersk, et al.,, had no intention of not paying the amount of P202.00, which consisted of sheriff\u2019s fee of P200.00 and clerk\u2019s commission of P2.00, charged in connection with their prayer for the issuance of a preliminary injunction and TRO. While Maersk, et al.,, did include such a prayer in their Petition, the same had already become moot and academic after RTC-Branch 32 issued the Order dated October 16, 1995 restoring and reinstating the Writ of Preliminary Injunction in favor of Maersk, et al., In their Supplemental Petition and Motion in G.R. No. 121613, Maersk, et al.,, was then only seeking the confirmation by the Court of the Order dated October 16, 1995 of RTC-Branch 32 and, in effect, withdrawing their prayer for the issuance of a writ of preliminary injunction and TRO by the Court. Besides, Maersk, et al.,, submitted that the sheriff\u2019s fee of P200.00 and clerk\u2019s commission of P2.00 were not part of the \u201clegal fees\u201d required for perfecting an appeal from the decision of the Court of Appeals or the RTC. The sheriff\u2019s fee and clerk\u2019s commission would merely be \u201cdeposited\u201d with the Court, which implied that said amounts would be \u201crefunded\u201d to Maersk, et al.,, in case the Court decided not to issue the TRO prayed for. In fact, when Maersk, et al.,, filed their motion for extension of time to file their petition for review on certiorari, they fully paid the docket and legal fees as computed by the cashier of the Court; and when they actually filed their Petition for Review on Certiorari with prayer for issuance of a writ of preliminary injunction and TRO, they were not assessed and required to pay additional legal fees. In any event, Maersk, et al.,, had already deposited with the Cashier\u2019s Office of the Court the amount of P202.00. Maersk, et al.,, asserted that their case is meritorious and that dismissal is discretionary for the appellate court and discretion must be exercised wisely and prudently, never capriciously, with a view to substantial justice. Consequently, Maersk, et al.,, prayed that the Court reconsider its Resolution dated October 23, 1995 and give due course to and squarely resolve their Petition and Supplemental Petition and Motion in G.R. No. 121613.Counsel for Maersk, et al.,, subsequently submitted a joint Memorandum[21] for the petitioners in G.R. Nos. 121613, 122333, and 122349.G.R. No. 121675Eastern Shipping was the petitioner in Civil Case No. 94-69028, which was consolidated with Civil Case Nos. 94-68861, 94-68862, 94-68863, 94-68919, 94-68936, 94-68939, 94-68940, and 94-68941, before RTC-Branch 32.Since the Decision dated August 28, 1995 of RTC-Branch 32 in the consolidated cases was contrary to its interest, Eastern Shipping appealed the same before the Court through a Petition for Review on Certiorari with Prayer for Preliminary Injunction and/or Temporary Restraining Order,[22] with the City Council of Manila, the Mayor of Manila, and the City of Manila, as respondents. In its Petition, docketed as G.R. No. 121675, Eastern Shipping raised pure questions of law and argued two fundamental issues:WHETHER OR NOT SECTION 21 OF [THE MANILA REVENUE CODE, AS AMENDED,] IS VALID AND CONSTITUTIONAL.IN THE REMOTE POSSIBILITY THAT THE QUESTIONED ORDINANCE IS DECLARED VALID AND CONSTITUTIONAL, WHETHER OR NOT [EASTERN SHIPPING] IS LIABLE TO PAY THE BUSINESS TAX BASED ON GROSS RECEIPTS DERIVED FROM INCOMING FREIGHTS ONLY OR OUTGOING FREIGHTS ONLY OR BOTH.[23]The Office of the City Legal Officer, on behalf of the City of Manila, Mayor Lim, Vice Mayor Atienza, the City Council of Manila/Sangguniang Panlungsod ng Maynila, and City Treasurer Acevedo, filed a joint Comment[24] on the Petitions in G.R. Nos. 121675, 121720-28, and 121847-55. Eastern Shipping later on filed its Memorandum.[25]G.R. No. 121704William Lines, Negros Navigation, Lorenzo Shipping, Gothong Lines, the Aboitiz Group, and Solid Shipping (collectively referred to herein as William Lines, et al.,) are duly organized domestic corporations principally engaged in the business of operating domestic shipping vessels for the transportation of cargoes and passengers, except Aboitiz Air Transport Corp., which is engaged in the transportation of cargoes by air, and Aboitiz Haulers, Inc. which is engaged in the business of domestic freight and hauling by land. William Lines, et al.,, all have principal addresses in Manila.William Lines, et al.,, paid under protest to the City of Manila the business taxes assessed against them for the first quarter of 1994, based on Section 21(B) of the Manila Revenue Code, as amended. They were intervenors in Civil Case Nos. 94-68861, 94-68862, 94-68863, 94-68919, 94-68936, 94-68939, 94-68940, 94-68941, and 94-69028, before RTC-Branch 32.William Lines, et al.,, challenged the Decision dated August 28, 1995 rendered by RTC-Branch 32 in said civil cases through a Petition for Review on Certiorari with Prayer for Issuance of a Preliminary Injunction and for a Temporary Restraining Order,[26] docketed as G.R. No. 121704. They identified as respondents the City of Manila, Mayor Lim, Vice Mayor Atienza, City Treasurer Acevedo, the Sangguniang Panlungsod ng Maynila, and RTC-Branch 32 Presiding Judge Juan C. Nabong, Jr. (Nabong). William Lines, et al.,, assigned three major errors purportedly committed by RTC-Branch 32:A. The RTC erred in failing to declare the aforecited Section 21(B) of [the Manila Revenue Code, as amended, as] ultra vires and therefore null and void because such sections violate the Provisions of the LGC x x x.x x x xB. The RTC erred in holding that Sec. 143(h) which is an omnibus grant of power couched in general terms is the exception referred or adverted to in Section 133(j) of the LGC.C. The RTC erred in holding that there are only four basic requirements for a valid exercise of the power of the City of Manila to levy tax. [27]In their Memorandum,[28] William Lines, et al.,, focused their discussion on the following issues:IS COMPLIANCE WITH THE GUIDELINES AND LIMITATIONS SET FORTH IN BOOK II TITLE I OF THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT [CODE] (LGC) NECESSARY FOR THE VALIDITY OF SEC. 21(B) OF [THE MANILA REVENUE CODE, AS AMENDED]?DID SEC. 21(B) OF [THE MANILA REVENUE CODE, AS AMENDED] VIOLATE SUCH GUIDELINES AND LIMITATIONS OF THE LGC?IS SEC. 21(B) OF [THE MANILA REVENUE CODE, AS AMENDED,] INVALID, ULTRA VIRES AND UNLAWFUL?[29]G.R. Nos. 121720-28PSTC is a government owned and controlled corporation engaged in the business of shipping, tinkering, lighterage, barging, towing, transport, and shipment of goods, chattels, petroleum and other products, marine, and maritime commerce in general.Pursuant to Section 21(B) of the Manila Revenue Code, as amended, PSTC was assessed by the City of Manila for business tax in the amount of P2,233,994.35, representing 50% of 1% of the gross receipts earned by PSTC in the year 1993 which amounted to P446,798,871.87. The total amount of business tax due was payable in four equal parts every quarter of 1994. PSTC paid under protest on January 19, 1994 the business tax for the first quarter of 1994 in the amount of P558,498.59, and on April 20, 1994 the business tax for the second quarter of 1994 in the amount of P558,498.59, evidenced by Municipal License Receipt Nos. 003483 and 0057675, respectively. PSTC claimed it had no other recourse but to pay to the City of Manila the assessed local business tax, considering the latter had threatened to cancel its license to operate if said taxes were not paid. PSTC, by way of letters dated February 21, 1994 and April 27, 1994, filed protests or claims for refund with the City Treasurer of Manila, but the letters were not acted upon.PSTC intervened in Civil Case Nos. 94-68861, 94-68862, 94-68863, 94-68919, 94-68936, 94-68939, 94-68940, 94-68941, and 94-69028 before RTC-Branch 32.Unsatisfied with the Decision dated August 28, 1995 rendered by RTC-Branch 32 in the said civil cases, PSTC filed with the Court a Petition for Review on Certiorari with Prayer for Temporary Restraining Order and/or Preliminary Injunction,[30] against Presiding Judge Nabong of RTC-Branch 32, the City of Manila, Mayor Lim, Vice Mayor Atienza, City Treasurer Acevedo, and the Sangguniang Panlungsod ng Maynila. In its Petition, docketed as G.R. No. 121720-28, PSTC maintained that RTC-Branch 32 erred thus:IIN FAILING TO REALIZE AND CONSIDER THAT THE RESPONDENT CITY OF MANILA, A MERE MUNICIPAL CORPORATION, HAS NO INHERENT POWER OF TAXATION.IIEVEN ASSUMING ARGUENDO THAT SUCH POWER IS CATEGORICALLY GRANTED BY STATUTE, THE SAME IS SUBJECT TO SUCH GUIDELINES AND LIMITATIONS PROVIDED BY CONGRESS UNDER SECTION 133 OF THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT CODE OF 1991 AND, AS TO WHICH, NONE WAS GIVEN TO RESPONDENT CITY OF MANILA.IIIIN FAILING TO REALIZE AND CONSIDER THAT AN ORDINANCE WHICH AMENDS, ENLARGES OR LIMITS THE PROVISIONS OF A STATUTE CONSTITUTES AN UNCONSTITUTIONAL AND ILLEGAL DEROGATION OF LEGISLATIVE POWER, HENCE, THE ORDINANCE IS INVALID AND VOID AB-INITIO.IVIN FAILING TO REALIZE AND CONSIDER THAT THE RESPONDENT CITY OF MANILA\u2019S [REVENUE CODE, AS AMENDED, PARTICULARLY SECTION 21(B) THEREOF] WHICH IMPOSES 50% OF 1% OF THE GROSS SALES OR RECEIPT OF THE NEXT PRECEDING YEAR, ON TOP OF THE NATIONAL INTERNAL REVENUE TAXES ALREADY IMPOSED UNDER THE NATIONAL INTERNAL REVENUE CODE, IS UNREASONABLE, UNJUST, UNFAIR OR OPPRESSIVE, CONFISCATORY, AND CONTRAVENES THE CONSTITUTION OR STATUTE, HENCE, THE ORDINANCE IS INVALID AND NULL AND VOID AB-INITIO.VIN FAILING TO REALIZE AND CONSIDER THAT THE TAX IMPOSED UNDER SECTION 21(B) OF [THE MANILA REVENUE CODE, AS AMENDED,] PARTAKES THE NATURE OF A SALES TAX OR A PERCENTAGE TAX BEYOND THE TAXING POWER OF THE RESPONDENT CITY OF MANILA TO IMPOSE, HENCE, UNENFORCEABLE BY RESPONDENT CITY OFFICIALS.VIIN FAILING TO REALIZE AND CONSIDER THAT [PSTC] IS SPECIFICALLY EXEMPTED FROM LOCAL GOVERNMENT TAXES IMPOSED UNDER THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT CODE OF 1991, PURSUANT TO SECTION 115 OF THE NATIONAL INTERNAL REVENUE CODE, AS AMENDED BY REPUBLIC ACT 7761.[31]As mentioned previously, the Office of the City Legal Officer, on behalf of the City of Manila, Mayor Lim, Vice Mayor Atienza, the City Council of Manila/Sangguniang Panlungsod ng Maynila, and City Treasurer Acevedo, filed a joint Comment on the Petitions in G.R. Nos. 121675, 121720-28, and 121847-55.PSTC filed its Memorandum,[32] summing up its issues and arguments, to wit:ISSUES SUBMITTED FOR RESOLUTION1.

Nos. 121847-55OFSI is a domestic corporation engaged in business as a transportation contractor. It also represents, as a general agent in the Philippines, ZIM Israel Navigation Co., Ltd. and Gold Star Line, Hong Kong, which are engaged in the transport by common carrier of export/import goods to and from the Philippines. Its offices are located in Intramuros, Manila.OFSI questioned the legality of Section 21(B) of the Manila Revenue Code, as amended, in a Petition for Declaratory Relief with Prayer for Preliminary Injunction and/or Temporary Restraining Order, which was docketed as Civil Case No. 94-68919 and originally raffled to RTC-Branch 55. Civil Case No. 94-68919 was eventually consolidated with Civil Case Nos. 94-68861, 94-68862, 94-68863, 94-68936, 94-68939, 94-68940, 94-68941, and 94-69028 before RTC-Branch 32. During the pendency of said civil cases, OFSI paid under protest on January 20, 1994 the business tax for the first quarter of 1994 amounting to P181,928.97. Pursuant to Section 196 of the Local Government Code (LGC), OFSI wrote the City Treasurer of Manila a letter dated March 1, 1994 claiming refund of the business tax it had paid. The letter was received by the City Treasurer\u2019s Office of Manila on March 3, 1994. The City Treasurer\u2019s Office of Manila had seven days from receipt of the letter to refund the amount paid, but more than two months had passed and OFSI received no response from the City Treasurer. To avoid multiplicity of suits, OFSI filed a Supplemental Petition in Civil Case No. 94-68919 to incorporate its claim for refund of the business tax it had paid for the first quarter of 1994.Aggrieved by the Decision dated August 28, 1995 of RTC-Branch 32 in Civil Case Nos. 94-68861, 94-68862, 94-68863, 94-68919, 94-68936, 94-68939, 94-68940, 94-68941, and 94-69028, OFSI sought recourse from the Court by filing a Petition for Review by Certiorari with Prayer for the Issuance of a Preliminary Injunction and/or Temporary Restraining Order,[34] naming as respondents the City of Manila, Mayor Lim, Vice Mayor Atienza, the City Council of Manila, City Treasurer Acevedo, and Presiding Judge Nabong of RTC-Branch 32. The Petition of OFSI, docketed as G.R. Nos. 121847-55, presented for consideration and resolution of the Court the following:Assignment of ErrorsTHE RESPONDENT HONORABLE JUDGE ERRED IN HIS FINDING THAT SECTION 21(B) OF [THE MANILA REVENUE CODE, AS AMENDED,] IS VALID AND CONSTITUTIONAL.Legal Issues Involved In This PetitionWHETHER OR NOT SECTION 21(B) OF [THE MANILA REVENUE CODE, AS AMENDED,] IS VALID AND CONSTITUTIONAL.WHETHER OR NOT A WRIT OF PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION AND/OR TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER MAY BE ISSUED BY THE HONORABLE COURT.[35]In a subsequent Manifestation,[36] OFSI informed the Court that RTC-Branch 32 issued an Order dated October 26, 1995 granting its Motion to Restore Injunction Pending Appeal; reinstating and restoring the Writ of Preliminary Injunction lifted on August 28, 1995; and requiring OFSI to post a bond in the increased amount of P300,000.00.A joint Comment on the Petitions in G.R. Nos. 121675, 121720-28, and 121847-55 was filed by the Office of the City Legal Officer, on behalf of the City of Manila, Mayor Lim, Vice Mayor Atienza, the City Council of Manila/Sangguniang Panlungsod ng Maynila, and City Treasurer Acevedo.The Reply[37] of OFSI was the last pleading filed in G.R. Nos. 121847-55.G.R. No. 122333After RTC-Branch 32 rendered its Decision in Civil Case Nos. 94-68861, 94-68862, 94-68863, 94-68919, 94-68936, 94-68939, 94-68940, 94-68941, and 94-69028 on August 28, 1995, upholding the constitutionality and validity of Section 21(B) of the Manila Revenue Code, as amended, and lifting the Writs of Preliminary Injunction issued in said cases, the City of Manila and its officials resumed the enforcement of the local business tax in question. City Treasurer Acevedo issued a Memorandum dated September 7, 1995, instructing Oscar S. Dizon, Acting Chief, License Division, City Treasurer\u2019s Office of Manila, to prepare the complete staff work \u201cfor the collection of the unpaid taxes, plus interests\u201d imposed by Section 21(B) of the Manila Revenue Code, as amended, against shipping companies and other common carriers.A Petition for Prohibition with Temporary Restraining Order and/or Preliminary Injunction[38] was jointly filed before the Court by several foreign and domestic corporations doing business in Manila as shipping companies and/or common carriers, namely: Cosco Container Lines (Cosco) and Heung-A Shipping Co., LTD., both represented by their resident agent, Wallem Philippines Shipping, Inc.; DSR Senator Lines, Compania Sud Americana de Vapores S.A., and Arimura Sangyo Company, Ltd., all represented by their resident agent, C.F. Sharp Shipping Agencies, Inc.; Pacific International Lines (PTE) Ltd. and Pacific Eagle Lines (PTE) Ltd., both represented by their resident agent, TMS Ship Agencies, Inc.; Compagnie Maritime D\u2019 Affretement (CMA), represented by its resident Agent, Inchcape Shipping Services; Everett Orient Lines, Inc., represented by it resident agent, Everett Steamship Corporation; Yangming Marine Transport Corp., represented by its resident agent, Sky International, Inc.; Nipon Yusen Kaisha, represented by its resident agent, Fil-Japan Shipping Corporation; Hyundai Merchant Marine Co., Ltd., represented by its resident agent, Citadel Lines; Malaysian International Shipping Corporation Berhad, represented by its resident agent, Royal Cargo Agencies, Inc.; Bolt Orient Line, represented by its resident agent, FILSOV Shipping Company, Inc.; Mitsui-O.S.K. Lines, Ltd., represented by its resident agent, Magsaysay Agencies, Inc.; Phils., Micronesia & Orient Navigation Co. (PMSO Line), represented by its resident agent, Van Transport Company, Inc.; Lloyd Triestino di Navigazione S.P.A.N. and Compagnie Generale Maritime, both represented by their resident agent, F.E. Zuellig (M), Inc.; and Madrigal-Wan Hai Lines (collectively referred to herein as Cosco, et al.,).The Petition of Cosco, et al.,, was docketed as G.R. No. 122333. In their Petition, Cosco, et al.,, presented for resolution of the Court the principal issue of whether or not Section 21(B) of the Manila Revenue Code, as amended, is constitutional. Cosco, et al.,, posited that Section 21(B) of the Manila Revenue Code, as amended, is unconstitutional and void ab initio because it was enacted by the Sangguniang Panlungsod ng Maynila, which was presided over by Vice Mayor Atienza, approved by Mayor Lim, and implemented and enforced by City Treasurer Acevedo, ultra vires and in violation of constitutional and statutory limitations on the taxing power of LGUs. Hence, Cosco, et al.,, prayed for the issuance of a writ of prohibition to restrain, enjoin, and prohibit respondents City of Manila, Mayor Lim, Vice Mayor Atienza, Sangguniang Panlungsod, and City Treasurer Acevedo, from enforcing Section 21(B) of the Manila Revenue Code, as amended.A joint Memorandum was filed on behalf of the petitioners in G.R. Nos. 121613, 122333, and 122349.G.R. No. 122335Sulpicio Lines, Inc. (Sulpicio Lines) is a domestic corporation, holding office in North Harbor, Manila, whose principal business is the operation of domestic shipping vessels for the transportation of cargoes and passengers.Sulpicio Lines and Gothong Lines jointly filed a complaint for declaratory relief with prayer for the issuance of a writ of preliminary injunction, which was docketed as Civil Case No. 94-69141 and raffled to RTC-Branch 44. Sulpicio Lines and Gothong Lines asked the trial court to determine the validity of Section 21(B) of the Manila Revenue Code, as amended, as well as the rights and duties of said shipping companies thereunder. However, after being informed that Maersk already filed a similar case, i.e., Civil Case No. 94-68861 before RTC-Branch 32, Gothong Lines decided to withdraw as complainant in Civil Case No. 94-69141 and simply intervene in Civil Case No. 94-68861. As a result, Sulpicio Lines became the sole complainant in Civil Case No. 94-69141. Sulpicio Lines then filed a Motion to Consolidate Civil Case No. 94-69141 with Civil Case No. 94-68861 which was granted.On August 28, 1995, RTC-Branch 32 rendered a Decision in Civil Case Nos. 94-68861, 94-68862, 94-68863, 94-68919, 94-68936, 94-68939, 94-68940, 94-68941, and 94-69028. Civil Case No. 94-69141 was not included in the caption of the Decision, although the complaint of Sulpicio Lines was mentioned in the body of the same Decision.Sulpicio Lines did not formally receive a copy of the aforementioned Decision dated August 28, 1995 of RTC-Branch 32 and was merely informed of the same by the petitioners/intervenors in the other civil cases. This prompted Sulpicio Lines to file with RTC-Branch 32 a Motion for Clarificatory Order seeking to verify if said Decision included and was binding on Sulpicio Lines. Acting on the Motion of Sulpicio Lines, RTC-Branch 32 issued an Order[39] on October 16, 1995, which reads:Although Civil Case No. 94-64191 is not included in the caption of the above Decision, the Decision against all the petitioners, intervenors, most specifically against intervenor Carlos A. Gothong Lines, Inc. is binding and enforceable against Sulpicio Lines, Inc. because Civil Case No. 94-64191 had been consolidated with Civil Case No. 94-68861.WHEREFORE, the Decision and the dispositive portion of the Decision rendered on August 28, 1995, shall apply to and binds Sulpicio Lines, Inc. x x x.After Sulpicio Lines confirmed that the Decision dated August 28, 1995 of RTC-Branch 32 in Civil Case Nos. 94-68861, 94-68862, 94-68863, 94-68919, 94-68936, 94-68939, 94-68940, 94-68941, and 94-69028, was also applicable to and binding upon it, it filed with the Court a Petition for Review on Certiorari with Prayer for Issuance of a Preliminary Injunction and for a Temporary Restraining Order,[40] against the City of Manila, Mayor Lim, Vice Mayor Atienza, City Treasurer Acevedo, the Sangguniang Panlungsod ng Maynila, and Presiding Judge Nabong of RTC-Branch 32. The appeal of Sulpicio Lines was docketed as G.R. No. 122335.The assignment of errors in the Petition of Sulpicio Lines was the same as that in the Petition of William Lines, et al.,, in G.R. No. 121704, viz.:A. The RTC erred in failing to declare that the aforecited Section 21(B) of [the Manila Revenue Code, as amended, as] ultra vires and therefore null and void because such sections of the Ordinances of the City of Manila violate the Provisions of the LGC x x xx x x xB. The RTC erred in holding that Sec. 143(h) which is an omnibus grant of power couched in general terms is the exception referred or adverted to in Section 133(j) of the LGC.C. The RTC erred in holding that there are only four basic requirements for a valid exercise of the power of the City of Manila to levy tax.[41]On January 31, 1996, the Court issued a Resolution[42] referring the Petition of Sulpicio Lines in G.R. No. 122335 to the Court of Appeals for proper determination and disposition pursuant to Section 9, paragraph 3 of Batas Pambansa Blg. 129, which granted the Court of Appeals \u201cexclusive appellate jurisdiction over all final judgments, decisions, resolutions, orders or awards of Regional Trial Courts and quasi-judicial agencies, instrumentalities, boards or commission.\u201dAt the Court of Appeals, the Petition of Sulpicio Lines was docketed as CA-G.R. SP No. 39973. In a Resolution[43] dated April 12, 1996, the appellate court directed the respondents City of Manila, Mayor Lim, Vice Mayor Atienza, City Treasurer Acevedo, the Sangguniang Panlungsod ng Maynila, and Presiding Judge Nabong of RTC-Branch 32, to file their Comments.In the meantime, Sulpicio Lines filed with the Court in G.R. No. 122335 a Motion for Reconsideration of the Resolution dated January 31, 1996 and for Consolidation.[44] Sulpicio Lines prayed that the Resolution dated January 31, 1996 of the Court in G.R. No. 122335 be withdrawn; that the rollo of G.R. No. 122335 be transmitted back to the Court; and that G.R. No. 122335 be consolidated with the other cases pending before the Court en banc questioning the Decision dated August 28, 1995 of RTC-Branch 32 which upheld the constitutionality and validity of Section 21(B) of the Manila Revenue Code, as amended.After several copies of its Resolutions were returned unserved on the respondents in G.R. Nos. 122335, 122349, and 124855, the Court issued a Resolution[45] on December 2, 1997 dispensing with the filing of a Comment by the respondents in the three cases.G.R. No. 122349The Association of International Shipping Lines, Inc. (AISL) is a non-stock domestic corporation the members of which are mostly foreign corporations duly licensed to do business in the Philippines, specifically: American Transport Lines, Inc., represented by its resident agent, Anchor International Shipping Agency, Inc.; Australian National Line, Fleet Trans International, and United Arab Shipping Co., all represented by their resident agent, Jardine Davies Transport; Dongnama Shipping Co., Ltd., represented by its resident agent, Uni-Ship Incorporated; Hanjin Shipping Company, Ltd., represented by its resident agent, MOF Company, Inc.; Hapag-Lloyd A/G, represented by its resident agent, Hapag-Lloyd Phils., Inc.; Kawasaki Kisen Kaisha, represented by its resident agent, Transmar Agencies, Inc.; Knutsen Line, represented by its resident agent, AWB Trade International; Kyowa Line, represented by its resident agent, Sky International, Inc.; Neptune Orient Line, represented by its resident agent, Overseas Agency Services, Inc.; Orient Overseas Container Line, represented by its resident agent, OOCL (Philippines), Inc.; P&O Containers, Ltd., P&O Swire Containers and WILH Wilhelmsen Line A/S, all represented by their resident agent, Soriamont Steamship Agencies; Regional Container Lines (Pte) Ltd., represented by its resident agent, South China Lines Phils., Inc.; Senator Line Bremen Germany, represented by its resident agent, C.F.

The Petition of AISL, docketed as G.R. No. 122349, was substantially similar to the Petition of Cosco, et al.,, in G.R. No. 122333.In its Resolution dated December 2, 1997, the Court dispensed with the filing of a Comment by the respondents in G.R. Nos. 122335, 122349, and 124855.The only other pleading in G.R. No. 122349 is a joint Memorandum filed on behalf of the petitioners in G.R. Nos. 121613, 122333, and 122349.G.R. No. 124855Dongnama and Kyowa are foreign corporations, organized and existing under the laws of the Republic of Korea and Japan, respectively. Both shipping companies are doing business in the Philippines through their resident agent, Sky International, Inc. (Sky International), with office in Binondo, Manila.Dongnama and Kyowa, through Sky International, lodged a petition to declare unconstitutional Section 21(B) of the Manila Revenue Code, as amended, with prayer for a writ of preliminary injunction and TRO, docketed as Civil Case No. 94-68936 and initially raffled to RTC-Branch 47, but later consolidated with Civil Case Nos. 94-68861, 94-68862, 94-68863, 94-68919, 94-68939, 94-68940, 94-68941, and 94-69028 before RTC-Branch 32. On August 28, 1995, RTC-Branch 32 rendered its Decision in the consolidated civil cases upholding the constitutionality and validity of Section 21(B) of the Manila Revenue Code, as amended.Dongnama and Kyowa then filed with the Court a Petition for Certiorari with Urgent Prayer for Restraining Order, seeking the annulment or modification of the foregoing Decision of RTC-Branch 32. The Petition was docketed as G.R. No. 122120. Instead of consolidating G.R. No. 122120 with the other pending cases that challenge the constitutionality and validity of Section 21(B) of the Manila Revenue Code, as amended, the Court issued a Resolution dated October 23, 1995 referring the Petition in G.R. No. 122120 to the Court of Appeals for the following reason:Considering that under Section 19 (sic), paragraph (1) of Batas Pambansa Blg. 129, the Court of Appeals now exercises original jurisdiction to issue writs of mandamus, prohibitions, certiorari, habeas corpus, and quo warranto, and auxiliary writs or processes, whether or not in aid of its appellate jurisdiction, the Court resolved to REFER this case to the Court of Appeals, for disposition.[47]The Petition for Certiorari of Dongnama and Kyowa was docketed as CA-G.R. SP No. 39188 before the Court of Appeals. The Court of Appeals rendered its Decision[48] in CA-G.R. SP No. 39188 on March 29, 1996, finding no merit in the Petition of Dongnama and Kyowa as RTC-Branch 32 did not act with grave abuse of discretion when it ruled in its Decision dated August 28, 1995 that Section 21(B) of the Manila Revenue Code, as amended, is valid and in clear conformity with the law and the Constitution. In the end, the appellate court adjudged:WHEREFORE, IN VIEW OF THE FOREGOING, the instant petition is hereby DENIED for lack of merit.[49]Dongnama and Kyowa went back before the Court \u201cby way of Petition for Review on Certiorari under Rule 65 of the Rules of Court,\u201d docketed as G.R. No. 124355, based on a lone assignment of error:RESPONDENT COURT OF APPEALS GRAVELY ABUSED ITS DISCRETION IN ASSUMING JURISDICTION OVER SUPREME COURT G.R. NO. 122120 ENTITLED \u201cDONGNAMA SHIPPING CO. LTD., AND KYOWA SHIPPING LTD. HEREIN REPRESENTED BY SKY INTERNATIONAL INC. VS. HON. JUDGE JUAN C. NABONG JR., CITY OF MANILA, MAYOR ALFREDO LIM, VICE MAYOR LITO ATIENZA, CITY COUNCIL OF MANILA, AND CITY TREASURER ANTHONY ACEVEDO\u201d WHEN IN FACT AS PER SUPREME COURT\u2019S RESOLUTION DATED 23 OCTOBER 1995 IN RELATION [TO] SECTION 9, PARAGRAPH (1) BATAS PAMBANSA BLG. 129, THE ORIGINAL JURISDICTION PERTAINING TO THE COURT OF APPEALS REFERS TO THE ISSUANCE OF WRIT OF CERTIORARI, AMONG OTHERS AND NOT TO PETITION FOR CERTIORARI ON THE GROUND OF GRAVE ABUSE OF DISCRETION WHICH THE HON. SUPREME COURT HAS EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION.[50]Dongnama and Kyowa specifically prayed:1. That this petition be given due course;2. That the Decision dated 29 March 1996 be annulled and set aside pending the resolution of the same to be decided together with other related cases by this Court;3. That respondent\u2019s Court of Appeals jurisdiction over the instant case be limited to the issue on the propriety of the prayer for preliminary injunction and restraining order in relation to the assailed Decision dated 28 August 1995 by RTC-Manila, Branch 32.[51]The Court, in a Resolution dated December 2, 1997, dispensed with the filing of a Comment by the respondents in G.R. Nos. 122335, 122349, and 124855.Dongnama and Kyowa eventually filed a Memorandum.[52]Consolidation of the 10 PetitionsThe foregoing 10 cases were consolidated at different times and stages.[53]On December 2, 1997, the Court issued a Resolution[54] giving due course to the Petitions and requiring the parties to simultaneously file their Memoranda within 20 days from notice.Among the parties to the 10 Petitions, Maersk, et al.,; Eastern Shipping; William Lines, et al.,; PSTC; Cosco, et al.,; AISL; and Dongnama and Kyowa (petitioners in G.R. Nos. 121613, 121675, 121704, 121720-28, 122333, 122349, and 124855, respectively) complied with the Resolution dated December 2, 1997 and submitted their Memoranda.In a Resolution[55] dated April 23, 2002, the Court resolved to consider the cases submitted for deliberation.The Court issued a Resolution[56] on July 5, 2011 requiring the parties to the 10 cases to move in the premises.A copy of the Resolution dated July 5, 2011 was served upon and received by Atty. Renato G. Dela Cruz (Dela Cruz), City Legal Officer of Manila, on behalf of the City of Manila, Mayor Lim, Vice Mayor Atienza, the City Council of Manila/Sangguniang Panlungsod ng Maynila, and City Treasurer Acevedo, the petitioners in G.R. No. 120051 and respondents in the other nine cases.Atty. Dela Cruz filed a Manifestation[57] informing the Court that despite exerting effort, he could no longer locate the records for the 10 cases. The former lawyers who handled the cases had long ceased to be connected with the City of Manila and both were already deceased. Thus, Atty. Dela Cruz prayed that he be furnished copies of the petitions and pleadings in the cases and be given a fresh period of 10 days from receipt thereof to submit his compliance with the Resolution dated July 5, 2011. The Court granted Atty. Cruz\u2019s prayer in a Resolution[58] dated April 24, 2012. Atty. Dela Cruz once more moved for an extension of time to comply with the Resolution dated July 5, 2011, which the Court granted in a Resolution[59] dated November 20, 2012.In a Resolution[60] dated July 16, 2013, the Court took notice that Atty. Dela Cruz failed to comply with the Resolution dated July 5, 2011 within the extended period which expired on November 8, 2012. Resultantly, the Court resolved to require Atty. Dela Cruz to (a) show cause why he should not be disciplinarily dealt with or held in contempt for such failure; and (b) comply with the Resolution dated July 5, 2011, both within 10 days from notice.Atty. Sitro G. Tajonera (Tajonera) of the Office of the City Legal Officer of Manila filed a Manifestation and Motion for Leave to Withdraw Petition in G.R. No. 120051[61] dated August 12, 2013. Atty. Tajonera moved for the withdrawal of the Petition in G.R. No. 120051 on the ground that the issues therein had been rendered moot and academic by the Decisions of the Court in Coca-Cola Bottlers Philippines, Inc. v. City of Manila[62] and City of Manila v. Coca-Cola Bottlers Philippines, Inc.[63] (Coca-Cola cases), which declared with finality the unconstitutionality of Section 21 of the Manila Revenue Code, as amended.Atty. Dela Cruz likewise filed a Compliance with the Court\u2019s Show Cause Resolution dated July 16, 2013. According to Atty. Dela Cruz, he already resigned as City Legal Officer of Manila effective May 31, 2013. Still, Atty. Dela Cruz explained:c. Due to the multifarious duties that undersigned attended to and the many legal problems that confronted the Mayor whom he had to assist in resolving them, he inadvertently overlooked the deadline set for submission of his compliance of the Court\u2019s directive which in fact lapsed without him having been reminded by Atty. Karen Peralta of the unfulfilled obligation to this Honorable Court.d. For this, he acknowledges that he was remiss in his duty to the Court and in delegating it to another.[e.] Undersigned begs the Court\u2019s clemency on his inability to submit the pleading required of him and his fault in relying on his subordinate-lawyer to assist him in complying with the Court\u2019s directive.[f.] Undersigned assures the Court that henceforth, he shall not commit the same mistake or any neglect of duty or lack of respect to the Court.[64]IIARGUMENTS OF THE PARTIESThere is only one vital issue in all the 10 cases: Whether or not Section 21(B) of the Manila Revenue Code, as amended, was in conformity with the Constitution and the laws and, therefore, valid.There are two fundamental and opposing positions on the issue. Presented below are summaries of the arguments in support of each.Section 21(B) of the Manila Revenue Code, as amended, was constitutionaland valid. The City of Manila, Mayor Lim, Vice Mayor Atienza, the Sangguniang Panlungsod ng Maynila, and City Treasurer Acevedo argued that Section 21(B) was constitutional and valid. RTC-Branch 32, in its Decision dated August 28, 1995 in Civil Case Nos. 94-68861, 94-68862, 94-68863, 94-68919, 94-68936, 94-68939, 94-68940, 94-68941, and 94-69028, and the Court of Appeals, in its Decision dated March 29, 1996 in CA-G.R. SP No. 39188, adopted the same position.The 1987 Constitution granted LGUs the power to create their own sources of revenue and to levy taxes, fees, and charges subject to the guidelines and limitations provided by Congress, consistent with the policy of local autonomy. This grant was reiterated in Section 129 of the LGC and the scope of tax powers of a city such as Manila is described in Section 151 also of the LGC. Hence, the Constitution and Congress, through the LGC, expressly granted LGUs the general power to tax.The enactment of Section 21(B) of the Manila Revenue Code, as amended, is statutorily ingrained. It is based on the exempting clause at the beginning of Section 133, in conjunction with Section 143(h), of the LGC. The relevant provisions of the Code are reproduced below:SEC. 133. Common Limitations on the Taxing Powers of Local Government Units. \u2013 Unless otherwise provided herein, the exercise of the taxing powers of provinces, cities, municipalities, and barangays shall not extend to the levy of the following:x x x x(j) Taxes on the gross receipts of transportation contractors and persons engaged in the transportation of passengers or freight by hire and common carriers by air, land or water, except as provided in this Code;SEC. 143. Tax on Business. \u2013 The municipality may impose taxes on the following businesses:x x x x(h) On any business, not otherwise specified in the preceding paragraphs, which the sanggunian concerned may deem proper to tax: Provided, That on any business subject to the excise, value-added or percentage tax under the National Internal Revenue Code, as amended, the rate of tax shall not exceed two percent (2%) of gross sales or receipts of the preceding calendar year.The sanggunian concerned may prescribe a schedule of graduated tax rates but in no case to exceed the rates prescribed herein. (Emphases supplied.)Inasmuch as \u201ctransportation contractors, persons who transport passenger or freight for hire, and common carriers by land, air or water,\u201d are engaged in business subject to excise, value added, or percentage tax under the National Internal Revenue Code (NIRC), as amended, then the City of Manila could lawfully levy local business tax under Section 21(B) of the Manila Revenue Code, as amended. It is irrelevant which of Sections 133(j) and 143(h) of the LGC is the special or general provision since there is an exempting clause in Section 133, that is, \u201cUnless otherwise provided herein,\u201d which means that even if the businesses enumerated therein are exempted from the levy of local tax, if there is a provision to the contrary, such as Section 143(h), the Sanggunian concerned could still impose the local tax. As an alternative argument, Section 133(j) of the LGC is the general provision on the limitations on the taxing power of the LGUs, while Section 143(h) of the LGC is the specific provision on the businesses which the LGUs could tax; and per the rules of statutory construction, the latter prevails over the former. To rule otherwise and adopt the construction put forward by the opposing parties would render Section 143(h) of the LGC a hollow decorative provision with no subject to tax.Moreover, the business tax imposed by Section 21(B) of the Manila Revenue Code, as amended, complied with the limitations and conditions in the LGC for a valid local tax: (1) The rate of tax did not exceed 2% of gross sales or receipts of the preceding calendar year; (2) The tax is consistent with the basic policy of local autonomy; (3) The tax is not unjust, excessive, oppressive, confiscatory, or contrary to declared national policy; and (4) That a prior public hearing was conducted for the purpose of enacting the Manila Revenue Code, as amended.Section 21(B) of the Manila Revenue Code, as amended, also enjoyed the presumption of constitutionality and validity. This presumption can only be overridden by overwhelming evidence to the contrary. In Drilon v. Lim,[65] the Court already declared the Manila Revenue Code as valid given that the procedural requirements for the enactment of the same had been observed.Lastly, taxes are the lifeblood of the nation. Tax exemptions are construed strictly against the taxpayer, and the burden is upon the person claiming exemption from the tax to show a clear grant of exemption by organic law or statute.Section 21(B) of the Manila RevenueCode, as amended, was null and void for being contrary to the Constitution and the LGC.On the other end of the spectrum, MAS; Maersk, et al.,; Eastern Shipping; William Lines, et al.,; PSTC; OFSI; Cosco, et al.,; Sulpicio Lines; AISL; and Dongnama and Kyowa, asserted that Section 21(B) of the Manila Revenue Code, as amended, was null and void because it violated the Constitution and the LGC. It was the position affirmed by RTC-Branch 43 in its Decision dated April 3, 1995 in Civil Case No. 94-69052.Under the Philippine system of government, the power of taxation, while inherent in the State in view of its sovereign prerogatives, is not inherent in municipal corporations or LGUs. LGUs may exercise the power only if and to the extent that it is delegated to them. One of the common limitations on the power to tax of LGUs is Section 133(j) of the LGC, carried over from the Local Tax Code of 1973.Section 133(j) expressly states that the taxing powers of the LGUs shall not extend to the transportation business. Section 133(j) of the LGC is a special provision, which prevails over Section 143(h) of the same Code, a general provision. This interpretation would give effect to both Sections 133(j) and 143(h) of the LGC, and contrary to the assertion of the City of Manila and its public officials, would not render Section 143(h) useless, meaningless, and nugatory. There are other businesses which the LGUs may tax under Section 143(h). Besides, in case of any doubt, any tax ordinance or revenue measure shall be construed strictly against the LGU enacting it and liberally in favor of the taxpayer, for taxes, being burdens, are not to be presumed beyond what the applicable statute expressly and clearly declares.In addition, although Section 21(B) of the Manila Revenue Code, as amended, imposed what was denominated as a \u201cbusiness tax,\u201d in reality it was a percentage or sales tax. Business tax is imposed on the privilege of doing business, though it may be computed as a percentage of gross sales. For business tax, there is no set ratio between volume of sales and the amount of tax. Cities and municipalities are given the power to impose business tax under Section 143(h) of the LGC. In contrast, percentage or sales tax is based on gross sales or receipts. The percentage bears a direct relationship to the sales or receipts generated by a business, without regard for the extent of operation or size of the business. Cities and municipalities may validly impose a tax on business, but consonant with the limitations on local taxation, they may not impose percentage or sales tax on top of what is already imposed in the NIRC. Section 21(B) of the Manila Revenue Code, as amended, imposing on \u201ctransportation contractors, persons who transport passenger or freight for hire, and common carriers by land, air or water,\u201d a tax of 50% of 1% of the gross sales or receipts from the preceding year on top of the national taxes already imposed by the NIRC was unjust, unfair, excessive, confiscatory, and in restraint of economic trade.And finally, Section 21(B) of the Manila Revenue Code, as amended, violated the rule on uniformity in taxation. Uniformity in taxation should not be construed in a pure geographical sense, i.e., that the questioned tax was imposed with the same force and effect on all businesses located in Manila. Shipping companies should be differentiated from other businesses. Aside from the risks and responsibilities the shipping companies shoulder, their services are not confined within the territorial limits of Manila alone but extend to other parts of the world. It is not uniformity for the shipping companies to be classed and taxed under the same category with other common carriers domiciled and plying Manila territory 24 hours a day.IIIRULING OF THE COURTResolution of pending incidents in several cases.Before delving into the merits of the 10 cases, there are pending incidents in three cases that first need to be addressed:(1) G.R. No. 120051: The City Legal Officer of Manila, as counsel for the City of Manila, Mayor Lim, and City Treasurer Acevedo, petitioners in G.R. No. 120051, filed a Manifestation and Motion for Leave to Withdraw Petition in G.R. No. 120051, on the ground that the issues therein had been rendered moot and academic by the Decisions of the Court in the Coca-Cola cases, which declared with finality the unconstitutionality of Section 21 of the Manila Revenue Code, as amended.The Court resolves to deny the motion to withdraw.There already had been an exchange of pleadings between the parties in G.R. No. 120051, i.e., Petition, Comment, and Reply. In a Resolution dated December 2, 1997, the Court also already considered G.R. No. 120051 and all the other nine consolidated cases submitted for deliberation. At this stage, the decision to grant or not to grant the motion to withdraw is fully within the discretion of the Court.[66]The Court denies the motion to withdraw because the assertion by the City Legal Officer of Manila that the Coca-Cola cases already rendered the issues in G.R. No. 120051 moot and academic is erroneous. The Court did not declare in the Coca-Cola cases that Section 21 of the Manila Revenue Code, as amended, was unconstitutional. What the Court held in the two Coca-Cola cases was that Ordinance Nos. 7988 and 8011 (approved by then Mayor Atienza on February 25, 2000 and February 22, 2001, respectively), amending Section 21 of the Manila Revenue Code, were null and void for (a) failure to comply with the publication requirement for tax ordinances under Section 188 of the LGC; and (b) deletion of an exempting proviso found in Section 143(h) of the LGC and the prior Section 21 of the Manila Revenue Code, which opened the door to the double taxation of Coca-Cola. Section 21 of the Manila Revenue Code, as it was amended by Ordinance No. 7807, and more specifically, paragraph (B) thereof, was not the subject of a constitutional review by the Court in the Coca-Cola cases.As for Atty. Dela Cruz\u2019s Compliance with the Court\u2019s Show Cause Resolution, the Court finds the same satisfactory, although he is reminded to be more conscientious of his duties as legal counsel in the future, despite the heavy volume of his work load.(2) G.R. No. 121613: In a Resolution dated October 23, 1995, the Court dismissed the Petition of Maersk, et al.,, for the latter\u2019s failure to deposit sheriff\u2019s fee and clerk\u2019s commission in the total amount of P202.00; and in light of said dismissal, noted without action the Supplemental Petition and Motion of Maersk, et al.,, praying for the confirmation of the Writ of Preliminary Injunction restored by RTC-Branch 32 and deletion of RTC-Branch 32 from the caption of G.R. No. 121613 for not being a necessary party. In their pending Motion for Reconsideration of the Resolution dated October 23, 1995, Maersk, et al.,, prayed that the Court give due course to and squarely resolve their Petition and Supplemental Petition and Motion.The Court resolves to grant the Motion for Reconsideration of Maersk, et al., It sets aside the Resolution dated October 23, 1995; reinstates the Petition of Maersk, et al.,, in G.R. No. 121613; and gives due course to the Petition and Supplemental Petition and Motion of Maersk, et al.,, in the said case.Of particular relevance to the plight of Maersk, et al.,, herein is the following discussion of the Court in Ayala Land, Inc. v. Carpo[67]:To be sure, the remedy of appeal is a purely statutory right and one who seeks to avail thereof must comply with the statute or rule. For this reason, payment of the full amount of the appellate court docket and other lawful fees within the reglementary period is mandatory and jurisdictional. However, as we have ruled in Aranas v. Endona, the strict application of the jurisdictional nature of the above rule on payment of appellate docket fees may be mitigated under exceptional circumstances to better serve the interest of justice. As early as 1946, in the case of Segovia v. Barrios, we ruled that where an appellant in good faith paid less than the correct amount for the docket fee because that was the amount he was required to pay by the clerk of court, and he promptly paid the balance, it is error to dismiss his appeal because \u2013every citizen has the right to assume and trust that a public officer charged by law with certain duties knows his duties and performs them in accordance with law. To penalize such citizen for relying upon said officer in all good faith is repugnant to justice.The ruling in Segovia was applied by this Court in subsequent cases where an appellant\u2019s right to appeal was threatened by the mistake of public officers in computing the correct amount of docket fee. Respondents draw attention to Rule 41, \u00a74 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure which provides that the appellate court docket and other lawful fees must be paid in full to the clerk of the court which rendered the judgment or final order appealed from within the period for taking the appeal. They argue that this Rule has overruled the decision in Segovia.This contention is untenable. Rule 41, \u00a74 must be read in relation to Rule 50, \u00a71(c) which provides that:An appeal may be dismissed by the Court of Appeals, on its own motion or on that of the appellee, on the following grounds:x x x x(c) Failure of the appellant to pay the docket and other lawful fees as provided in Section 4 of Rule 41.x x x xWith the exception of \u00a71(b), which refers to the failure to file notice of appeal or the record on appeal within the period prescribed by these Rules, the grounds enumerated in Rule 50, \u00a71 are merely directory and not mandatory. This is plain from the use of the permissive \u201cmay\u201d in the text of the statute. Despite the jurisdictional nature of the rule on payment of docket fee, therefore, the appellate court still has the discretion to relax the rule in meritorious cases. The ruling in Segovia is still good law which the appellate court, in the exercise of its discretion, must apply in circumstances such as that in the present case where an appellant was, from the start, ready and willing to pay the correct amount of docket fee, but was unable to do so due to the error of an officer of the court in computing the correct amount. To hold otherwise would be unjust and unwarranted. (Citations omitted.)The Court notes that Revised Circular No. 1-88, effective July 1, 1991, which was cited in the Resolution dated October 23, 1995 as basis for the dismissal of the Petition of Maersk, et al.,, also used the word \u201cmay\u201d in the first paragraph thereof:(1) Payment of docketing and other fees. \u2013 Section 1 of Rule 45 requires that petitions for review be filed and the required fees paid within the prescribed period. Unless exempted by law or rule, such fees must be fully paid in accordance with this Circular; otherwise, the Court may deny the petition outright. The same rule shall govern petitions under Rule 65. (Emphasis supplied.)Hence, denial of the petition for review outright for failure to pay docketing and other fees within the prescribed period was also directory and not mandatory upon the Court under Revised Circular No. 1-88.In the exercise of its discretion, the Court determines that there was meritorious reason why Maersk, et al.,, paid docket and other legal fees within the prescribed period, but short of the P202.00 for sheriff\u2019s fee and clerk\u2019s commission. Maersk, et al.,, were already assessed and required to pay the docket and legal fees when they filed their Motion for Extension of Time to File Petition for Review on Certiorari. The Motion did not yet indicate that the intended Petition would include a prayer for a TRO, so the receiving clerk did not assess Maersk, et al.,, for sheriff\u2019s fee and clerk\u2019s commission. When Maersk, et al.,, actually filed their Petition with prayer for the issuance of a writ of preliminary injunction and TRO, they were no longer assessed additional fees by the receiving clerk. Maersk, et al.,, found out about the deficiency in their legal fees upon their receipt of the Resolution dated October 23, 1995 already dismissing their Petition and noting without action their Supplemental Petition and Motion. Maersk, et al.,, immediately filed a Motion for Reconsideration of said Resolution, and also deposited their balance of P202.00 with the Court.Given the circumstances, Maersk, et al.,, cannot be faulted for their failure to pay the required legal fees for such failure was clearly not a dilatory tactic nor intended to circumvent the Rules of Court. On the contrary, the subsequent payment by Maersk, et al.,, of the P202.00 deficiency even before the Court had passed upon their Motion for Reconsideration was indicative of their good faith and willingness to comply with the Rules.[68]Acting on the Supplemental Petition and Motion of Maersk, et al.,, the Court further resolves to NOTE WITHOUT ACTION the prayer to confirm the Writ of Preliminary Injunction restored by RTC-Branch 32 in light of the present judgment, and to GRANT the prayer to delete RTC-Branch 32 from the caption of the case as it was not a necessary party.(3) G.R. No. 122335: In a Resolution dated January 31, 1996, the Court referred the Petition of Sulpicio Lines to the Court of Appeals. There is a pending Motion for Reconsideration of the Resolution dated January 31, 1996 filed by Sulpicio Lines seeking the withdrawal of the Resolution dated January 31, 1996 and transmittal of the rollo of G.R. No. 122335 from the Court of Appeals back to the Court.The Court resolves to grant the Motion for Reconsideration of Sulpicio Lines. It sets aside the Resolution dated January 31, 1996 and gives due course to the Petition of Sulpicio Lines in G.R. No. 122335.The Petition for Review on Certiorari of Sulpicio Lines, filed under Rule 42 of the old Rules of Court, should not have been referred to the Court of Appeals. It is true that under Section 9, paragraph (3) of Batas Pambansa Blg. 129, the Court of Appeals has \u201c(e)xclusive appellate jurisdiction over all final judgments, resolutions, orders or awards of Regional Trial Courts x x x.\u201d However, Rule 42 of the old Rules of Court, then in effect, allowed an appeal straight from the RTC (formerly called Court of First Instance) to the Supreme Court when the appeal raised pure questions of law:RULE 42APPEAL FROM COURTS OF FIRST INSTANCETO SUPREME COURTSection 1. Procedure. \u2013 The procedure of appeal to the Supreme Court from Courts of First Instance shall be governed by the same rules governing appeals to the Court of Appeals, except as hereinafter provided.Section 2. Appeals on pure question of law. \u2013 Where the appellant states in his notice of appeal or record on appeal that he will raise only questions of law, no other question shall be allowed, and the evidence need not be elevated.A cursory reading of the Petition for Review on Certiorari of Sulpicio Lines would readily reveal that it appealed the Decision dated August 28, 1995 of RTC-Branch 32 in Civil Case Nos. 94-68861, 94-68862, 94-68863, 94-68919, 94-68936, 94-68939, 94-68940, 94-68941, and 94-69028 based only on questions of law. The Petition did not raise any question of fact and did not require the presentation or elevation of evidence.In G.R. No. 124855, Dongnama and Kyowa questioned the Resolution dated October 23, 1995, which similarly referred their original Petition for Certiorari, docketed as G.R. No. 122120, to the Court of Appeals, where it was docketed as CA-G.R. SP No. 39188. The Resolution dated October 23, 1995 cited as basis for the referral Section 9, paragraph (1) of Batas Pambansa Blg. 129 which gave the Court of Appeals \u201c[o]riginal jurisdiction to issue writs of mandamus, prohibition, certiorari, habeas corpus, and quo warranto, and auxiliary writs or processes, whether or not in aid of its appellate jurisdiction.\u201d The Court, however, will no longer address the propriety of the referral of the original Petition of Dongnama and Kyowa to the Court of Appeals since said issue has become moot and academic after the appellate court rendered its Decision in CA-G.R. SP No. 39188 on March 29, 1996. The Court will simply treat the Petition in G.R. No. 124855 as an appeal of the Decision dated March 29, 1996 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 39188.Ruling on the merits of the 10 Petitions. The Court rules in favor of MAS; Maersk, et al.,; Eastern Shipping; William Lines, et al.,; PSTC; OFSI; Cosco, et al.,; Sulpicio Lines; AISL; and Dongnama and Kyowa. Section 21(B) of the Manila Revenue Code, as amended, was null and void for being beyond the power of the City of Manila and its public officials to enact, approve, and implement under the LGC.It is already well-settled that although the power to tax is inherent in the State, the same is not true for the LGUs to whom the power must be delegated by Congress and must be exercised within the guidelines and limitations that Congress may provide. The Court expounded in Pelizloy Realty Corporation v. The Province of Benguet[69] that:The power to tax \u201cis an attribute of sovereignty,\u201d and as such, inheres in the State. Such, however, is not true for provinces, cities, municipalities and barangays as they are not the sovereign; rather, they are mere \u201cterritorial and political subdivisions of the Republic of the Philippines\u201d.The rule governing the taxing power of provinces, cities, municipalities and barangays is summarized in Icard v. City Council of Baguio:It is settled that a municipal corporation unlike a sovereign state is clothed with no inherent power of taxation. The charter or statute must plainly show an intent to confer that power or the municipality, cannot assume it. And the power when granted is to be construed in strictissimi juris. Any doubt or ambiguity arising out of the term used in granting that power must be resolved against the municipality. Inferences, implications, deductions \u2013 all these \u2013 have no place in the interpretation of the taxing power of a municipal corporation.Therefore, the power of a province to tax is limited to the extent that such power is delegated to it either by the Constitution or by statute. Section 5, Article X of the 1987 Constitution is clear on this point:Section 5. Each local government unit shall have the power to create its own sources of revenues and to levy taxes, fees and charges subject to such guidelines and limitations as the Congress may provide, consistent with the basic policy of local autonomy. Such taxes, fees, and charges shall accrue exclusively to the local governments.Per Section 5, Article X of the 1987 Constitution, \u201cthe power to tax is no longer vested exclusively on Congress; local legislative bodies are now given direct authority to levy taxes, fees and other charges.\u201d Nevertheless, such authority is \u201csubject to such guidelines and limitations as the Congress may provide\u201d.In conformity with Section 3, Article X of the 1987 Constitution, Congress enacted Republic Act No. 7160, otherwise known as the Local Government Code of 1991. Book II of the LGC governs local taxation and fiscal matters.Relevant provisions of Book II of the LGC establish the parameters of the taxing powers of LGUs found below.First, Section 130 provides for the following fundamental principles governing the taxing powers of LGUs:Taxation shall be uniform in each LGU.Taxes, fees, charges and other impositions shall:be equitable and based as far as practicable on the taxpayer\u2019s ability to pay;be levied and collected only for public purposes;not be unjust, excessive, oppressive, or confiscatory;not be contrary to law, public policy, national economic policy, or in the restraint of trade.The collection of local taxes, fees, charges and other impositions shall in no case be let to any private person.The revenue collected pursuant to the provisions of the LGC shall inure solely to the benefit of, and be subject to the disposition by, the LGU levying the tax, fee, charge or other imposition unless otherwise specifically provided by the LGC. Each LGU shall, as far as practicable, evolve a progressive system of taxation.Second, Section 133 provides for the common limitations on the taxing powers of LGUs. x x x. (Underscoring and citations omitted.)Among the common limitations on the taxing power of LGUs is Section 133(j) of the LGC, which states that \u201c[u]nless otherwise provided herein,\u201d the taxing power of LGUs shall not extend to \u201c[t]axes on the gross receipts of transportation contractors and persons engaged in the transportation of passengers or freight by hire and common carriers by air, land or water, except as provided in this Code[.]\u201dSection 133(j) of the LGC clearly and unambiguously proscribes LGUs from imposing any tax on the gross receipts of transportation contractors, persons engaged in the transportation of passengers or freight by hire, and common carriers by air, land, or water. Yet, confusion arose from the phrase \u201cunless otherwise provided herein,\u201d found at the beginning of the said provision. The City of Manila and its public officials insisted that said clause recognized the power of the municipality or city, under Section 143(h) of the LGC, to impose tax \u201con any business subject to the excise, value-added or percentage tax under the National Internal Revenue Code, as amended.\u201d And it was pursuant to Section 143(h) of the LGC that the City of Manila and its public officials enacted, approved, and implemented Section 21(B) of the Manila Revenue Code, as amended.The Court is not convinced. Section 133(j) of the LGC prevails over Section 143(h) of the same Code, and Section 21(B) of the Manila Revenue Code, as amended, was manifestly in contravention of the former.First, Section 133(j) of the LGC is a specific provision that explicitly withholds from any LGU, i.e., whether the province, city, municipality, or barangay, the power to tax the gross receipts of transportation contractors, persons engaged in the transportation of passengers or freight by hire, and common carriers by air, land, or water.In contrast, Section 143 of the LGC defines the general power of the municipality (as well as the city, if read in relation to Section 151[70] of the same Code) to tax businesses within its jurisdiction. While paragraphs (a) to (g) thereof identify the particular businesses and fix the imposable tax rates for each, paragraph (h) is apparently the \u201ccatch-all provision\u201d allowing the municipality to impose tax \u201con any business, not otherwise specified in the preceding paragraphs, which the sanggunian concerned may deem proper to tax[.]\u201dThe succeeding proviso of Section 143(h) of the LGC, viz., \u201cProvided, That on any business subject to the excise, value-added or percentage tax under the National Internal Revenue Code, as amended, the rate of tax shall not exceed two percent (2%) of gross sales or receipts of the preceding calendar year[,]\u201d is not a specific grant of power to the municipality or city to impose business tax on the gross sales or receipts of such a business. Rather, the proviso only fixes a maximum rate of imposable business tax in case the business taxed under Section 143(h) of the LGC happens to be subject to excise, value added, or percentage tax under the NIRC.The omnibus grant of power to municipalities and cities under Section 143(h) of the LGC cannot overcome the specific exception/exemption in Section 133(j) of the same Code. This is in accord with the rule on statutory construction that specific provisions must prevail over general ones.[71] A special and specific provision prevails over a general provision irrespective of their relative positions in the statute. Generalia specialibus non derogant. Where there is in the same statute a particular enactment and also a general one which in its most comprehensive sense would include what is embraced in the former, the particular enactment must be operative, and the general enactment must be taken to affect only such cases within its general language as are not within the provisions of the particular enactment.[72]In the case at bar, the sanggunian of the municipality or city cannot enact an ordinance imposing business tax on the gross receipts of transportation contractors, persons engaged in the transportation of passengers or freight by hire, and common carriers by air, land, or water, when said sanggunian was already specifically prohibited from doing so. Any exception to the express prohibition under Section 133(j) of the LGC should be just as specific and unambiguous.Second, the construction adopted by the Court gives effect to both Sections 133(j) and 143(h) of the LGC. In construing a law, care should be taken that every part thereof be given effect and a construction that could render a provision inoperative should be avoided, and inconsistent provisions should be reconciled whenever possible as parts of a harmonious whole.[73]As pointed out by William Lines, et al.,, in their Petition, despite the prohibition against LGUs imposing tax on the gross receipts of transportation contractors, persons engaged in the transportation of passengers or freight by hire, and common carriers by air, land, or water, under Section 133(j) of the LGC, there are still other multiple businesses subject to excise, value added, or percentage tax under the NIRC, which the municipalities and cities can still tax pursuant to Section 143(h) of the LGC, such as: 1) Hotels and motels under Sec. 113 of the NIRC; 2) Caterers, taxed under Sec. 114 of the NIRC; 3) Dealers in securities, taxed under Sec. 116 of the NIRC; 4) Franchise holders, taxed under Sec. 117 of the NIRC; 5) Senders of overseas dispatch, message or communication originating in the Philippines, taxed under Sec. 118 of the NIRC; 6) Banks and non-bank financial intermediaries, taxed under Sec. 119 of the NIRC; 7) Finance companies, taxed under Sec. 120 of the NIRC; 8) Agents of foreign insurance companies, taxed under Sec. 122 of the NIRC; 9) Amusement places, taxed under Sec. 123 of the NIRC; 10) Winners in horse races, taxed under Sec. 124 of the NIRC; and 11) Those who sell, barter, or exchange shares of stocks, taxed under Sec. 124-A of the NIRC.[74] Thus, Section 143(h) of the LGC would not be \u201ca hollow decorative provision with no subject to tax.\u201d On the contrary, it would be Section 133(j) of the LGC which would become inoperative should the Court accept the construction proffered by the City of Manila and its public officials, because then, there would be no instance at all when the gross receipts of the transportation contractors, persons engaged in the transportation of passengers or freight by hire, and common carriers by air, land, or water, would not be subject to tax by the LGUs.Third, Section 5(b) of the LGC itself, on Rules of Interpretation, provides:SEC. 5. Rules of Interpretation. \u2013 In the interpretation of the provisions of this Code, the following rules shall apply:x x x x(b) In case of doubt, any tax ordinance or revenue measure shall be construed strictly against the local government unit enacting it, and liberally in favor of the taxpayer. Any tax exemption, incentive or relief granted by any local government unit pursuant to the provisions of this Code shall be construed strictly against the person claiming it[.]The Court strictly construes Section 21(B) of the Manila Revenue Code, as amended, against the City of Manila and its public officials and liberally in favor of the transportation contractors, persons engaged in the transportation of passengers or freight by hire, and common carriers by air, land, or water. Strictly assessed against the guidelines and limitations set forth in the LGC, Section 21(B) of the Manila Revenue Code, as amended, was enacted ultra vires.And fourth, the construction adopted by the Court is in accordance with the consistent intention of the laws to withhold from the LGUs the power to tax transportation contractors, persons engaged in the transportation of passengers or freight by hire, and common carriers by air, land, or water.Even prior to Section 133(j) of the LGC, Section 5(e) of Presidential Decree No. 231, otherwise known as The Local Tax Code, as amended, already limited the taxing powers of LGUs as follows:SEC. 5. Common limitations on the taxing powers of local government. \u2013 The exercise of the taxing powers of provinces, cities, municipalities and barrios shall not extend to the imposition of the following:x x x x(e) Taxes on the business of transportation contractors and persons engaged in the transportation of passengers or freight by hire and common carries by air, land or water except as otherwise provided in this Code, and taxes or fees for the registration of motor vehicles and for the issuance of all kinds of licenses or permits for the driving thereof;The Court, in First Philippine Industrial Corp. v. Court of Appeals,[75] expounded on the lawmakers\u2019 reason for exempting the gross receipts of common carriers from the taxing powers of the LGUs:From the foregoing disquisition, there is no doubt that petitioner is a \u201ccommon carrier\u201d and, therefore, exempt from the business tax as provided for in Section 133 (j), of the Local Government Code x x xx x x xThe deliberations conducted in the House of Representatives on the Local Government Code of 1991 are illuminating:\u201cMR. AQUINO (A). Thank you, Mr. Speaker.Mr. Speaker, we would like to proceed to page 95, line 1. It states: \u201cSEC. 121 (now Sec. 131). Common Limitations on the Taxing Powers of Local Government Units.\u201d . . .MR. AQUINO (A.). Thank you Mr. Speaker.Still on page 95, subparagraph 5, on taxes on the business of transportation. This appears to be one of those being deemed to be exempted from the taxing powers of the local government units. May we know the reason why the transportation business is being excluded from the taxing powers of the local government units?MR. JAVIER (E.). Mr. Speaker, there is an exception contained in Section 121 (now Sec. 131), line 16, paragraph 5. It states that local government units may not impose taxes on the business of transportation, except as otherwise provided in this code.Now, Mr. Speaker, if the Gentleman would care to go to page 98 of Book II, one can see there that provinces have the power to impose a tax on business enjoying a franchise at the rate of not more than one-half of 1 percent of the gross annual receipts. So, transportation contractors who are enjoying a franchise would be subject to tax by the province. That is the exception, Mr. Speaker.What we want to guard against here, Mr. Speaker is the imposition of taxes by local government units on the carrier business. Local government units may impose taxes on top of what is already being imposed by the National Internal Revenue Code which is the so-called \u201ccommon carriers tax.\u201d We do not want a duplication of this tax, so we just provided for an exception under Section 125 (now Section 137) that a province may impose this tax at a specific rate.MR. AQUINO (A.). Thank you for that clarification, Mr. Speaker. . . .It is clear that the legislative intent in excluding from the taxing power of the local government unit the imposition of business tax against common carriers is to prevent a duplication of the so-called \u201ccommon carrier\u2019s tax.\u201dPetitioner is already paying three (3%) percent common carrier's tax on its gross sales/earnings under the National Internal Revenue Code. To tax petitioner again on its gross receipts in its transportation of petroleum business would defeat the purpose of the Local Government Code. (Citations omitted.)Consistent with the foregoing legislative intent, Republic Act No. 7716, more popularly known as the Expanded Value-Added Tax (E-VAT) Law, which took effect after the LGC on May 28, 1994, expressly amended the NIRC of 1977 and added to Section 115 of the latter on \u201cPercentage tax on carriers and keepers of garages,\u201d the following proscription: \u201cThe gross receipts of common carriers derived from their incoming and outgoing freight shall not be subjected to the local taxes imposed under Republic Act No. 7160, otherwise known as the Local Government Code of 1991.\u201dIVDISPOSITIVE PORTIONWHEREFORE, in view of the foregoing, the Court hereby RESOLVES:1. In G.R. No. 120051: (a) to DENY the Motion to Withdraw the Petition filed by the Office of the City Legal Officer on behalf of the City of Manila, Mayor Atienza, and City Treasurer Acevedo; and (b) to DECLARE as SATISFACTORY the Compliance submitted by Atty.

[2]\n\nI\nANTECEDENT FACTS\n\nThe Manila Revenue Code was enacted on June 22, 1993 by the City Council of Manila and approved on June 29, 1993 by then Manila Mayor Alfredo S. Lim (Lim).\u00a0 Section 21(B) of said Code originally provided:\n\nSection 21. Tax on Businesses Subject to the Excise, Value-Added or Percentage Taxes Under the NIRC . \u2013 On any of the following businesses and articles of commerce subject to the excise, value-added or percentage taxes under the National Internal Revenue Code, hereinafter referred to as NIRC, as amended, a tax of three percent (3%) per annum on the gross sales or receipts of the preceding calendar year is hereby imposed:\n\nx x x x\n\nB)\u00a0 On the gross receipts of keepers of garages, cars for rent or hire driven by the lessee, transportation contractors, persons who transport passenger or freight for hire, and common carriers by land, air or water, except owners of bancas and owners of animal-drawn two-wheel vehicle.\n\nShortly thereafter, Ordinance No. 7807 was enacted by the City Council of Manila on September 27, 1993 and approved by Mayor Lim on September 29, 1993, already amending several provisions of the Manila Revenue Code.\u00a0 Section 21 of the Manila Revenue Code, as amended, imposed a lower tax rate on the businesses that fell under it, and paragraph (B) thereof read as follows:\n\nSection 21. Tax on Business Subject to the Excise, Value-Added or Percentage Taxes Under the NIRC \u2013\u00a0 On any of the following businesses and articles of commerce subject to the excise, value-added or percentage taxes under the National Internal Revenue Code hereinafter referred to as NIRC, as amended, a tax of FIFTY PERCENT (50%) OF ONE PERCENT (1%) per annum on the gross sales or receipts of the preceding calendar year is hereby imposed:\n\nx x x x\n\nB)\u00a0 On the gross receipts of keepers of garages, cars for rent or hire driven by the lessee, transportation contractors, persons who transport passenger or freight for hire, and common carriers by land, air or water, except owners of bancas and owners of animal-drawn two-wheel vehicle.\nThe City of Manila, through its City Treasurer, began imposing and collecting the business tax under Section 21(B) of the Manila Revenue Code, as amended, beginning January 1994.\n\nG.R. No. 120051\n\nMalaysian Airline System (MAS) is a foreign corporation organized and existing under the laws of Malaysia.\u00a0 It is licensed to engage in business in the Philippines by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), particularly in the airline business which involves the transportation of passengers and cargo for hire.\u00a0 Its principal office and place of business in the Philippines is located in the City of Manila.\n\nAs MAS was renewing its business permit for 1994, it was assessed by the City Treasurer of Manila on January 17, 1994 for the following taxes and fees:\n\n[TABLE_CONTENT]\nMayor\u2019s permit and regulatory fees | P \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 10,307.50 | \nMunicipal license tax or business tax | 1,100,000.00 | \nTotal | P 1,110,307.50[3] | \n[END_TABLE]\n\nMayor\u2019s permit and regulatory fees P \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 10,307.50 Municipal license tax or business tax 1,100,000.00 Total P 1,110,307.50 [3]\nMAS, believing that it was exempt from the municipal license tax or business tax, tendered, via Far East Bank and Trust Company (FEBTC) Check No. 06564 dated January 19, 1994, only the amount of P10,307.50 for the mayor\u2019s permit and regulatory fees.\u00a0 The City Treasurer of Manila refused to accept FEBTC Check No. 06564.\n\nConsequently, on January 20, 1994, MAS instituted Civil Case No. 94-69052, to consign with the trial court the amount of P10,307.50 for mayor\u2019s permit and regulatory fees; to challenge the assessment against it by the City Treasurer of Manila in the amount of P1,100,000.00 for municipal license tax or business tax; and to have Section\u00a0 21(B) of the Manila Revenue Code, as amended, on which said assessment for municipal license tax or business tax was based, be declared invalid or null and void.\u00a0 Civil Case No.\u00a0 94-69052 was assigned to the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Manila, Branch 43.\n\nOn April 3, 1995, RTC-Branch 43 rendered a Decision [4] in favor of MAS.\u00a0 The dispositive portion of said Decision reads:\n\nWHEREFORE, the foregoing disquisitions considered, judgment is hereby rendered in favor of the plaintiff against the defendants:\nDeclaring the consignation valid and made in accordance with law;\n\nOrdering defendants to issue to plaintiff the mayor\u2019s permit or permit to operate for 1994, the necessary certificates and official receipts evidencing payment of [plaintiff\u2019s] liabilities for mayor\u2019s permit fee and other regulatory fees for 1994; and,\n\nDeclaring Section 21(B) of Ordinance No. 7794, as amended by Ordinance No. 7807, of the City of Manila as invalid or null and void insofar as it imposes a business tax on transportation contractors, persons engaged in the transportation of passengers or freight by hire and common carriers by air, land or water, or that plaintiff is exempt from the tax imposed by said section 21(B).\n\nDeclaring plaintiff\u2019s obligation to the defendant City of Manila for mayor\u2019s permit fee and other regulatory fees for 1994 as having been paid and extinguished without any liability for surcharges, interests or any additional amount whatsoever. Not having been proven, the prayer for the payment of attorney\u2019s fees is denied.\n\nNo pronouncement as to costs. [5]\n\nThe City of Manila, Mayor Lim, and City Treasurer Anthony Y. Acevedo (Acevedo) filed with the Court a Petition for Review on Certiorari, [6] assailing the Decision dated April 3, 1995 of RTC-Branch 43 in Civil Case No. 94-69052 based on pure questions of law.\u00a0 They assigned the following errors on the part of RTC-Branch 43:\n\n4.1. That the trial court erred in declaring Section 21(B) of [the Manila Revenue Code, as amended,] as invalid or null and void.\n\n4.2.

(Eastern Shipping)\nAll of the aforementioned cases were later consolidated before RTC-Branch 32.\n\nSeveral more corporations with principal offices in Manila and engaged in the same line of business as the above-named petitioner corporations filed petitions/complaints-in-intervention in the pending cases, namely: William Lines, Inc. (William Lines); Negros Navigation Co., Inc. (Negros Navigation); Lorenzo Shipping Corp. (Lorenzo Shipping); Carlos A. Gothong Lines, Inc. (Gothong Lines); Aboitiz Shipping Corp., Aboitiz Air Transport Corp., and Aboitiz Haulers, Inc. (collectively referred to as the Aboitiz Group); Solid Shipping Lines Corp. (Solid Shipping); and PNOC Shipping & Transport Corp. (PSTC).\n\nPetitioner and intervenor corporations essentially sought the (1) declaration of Section 21(B) of the Manila Revenue Code, as amended, as void/invalid for being contrary to the Constitution and the Local Government Code (LGC) of 1991; (2) refund of the business taxes that the petitioner and intervenor corporations paid under protest; and (3) the issuance of a temporary restraining order (TRO), writ of preliminary injunction, writ of prohibition, and/or writ of permanent injunction to enjoin the implementation of Section 21(B) of the Manila Revenue Code, as amended.\n\nRTC-Branch 32 issued a TRO [11] on January 14, 1994 in favor of petitioners Maersk, APL, Flagship Tankers, CIMC, and CMC.\u00a0 The TRO was effective for 20 days and ordered respondent City of Manila and local officials to cease and desist from implementing Section 21(B) of the Manila Revenue Code, as amended, while the prayer for a writ of preliminary injunction was scheduled for presentation of evidence.\u00a0 On February 3, 1992, after hearing, RTC-Branch 32 issued an Order granting the prayer of petitioners Maersk, APL, Flagship Tankers, CIMC, CMC, and OFSI for the issuance of a Writ of Preliminary Injunction, [12] with the condition that each of said petitioner corporations should post an injunction bond in the amount of P50,000.00.\u00a0 The Writ of Preliminary Injunction enjoined respondent City of Manila and local officials from: (1) imposing, enforcing, assessing, and collecting the taxes under Section 21(B) of the Manila Revenue Code, as amended; and (2) denying to petitioners Maersk, APL, Flagship Tankers, CIMC, CMC, and OFSI their business permits and licenses for 1994.\u00a0 In another Order dated April 22, 1994, RTC-Branch 32 granted the prayer of intervenor corporations for the issuance of a similar Writ of Preliminary Injunction.\n\nIn its Decision [13] dated August 28, 1995 in Civil Case Nos. 94-68861, 94-68862, 94-68863, 94-68919, 94-68936, 94-68939, 94-68940, 94-68941, and 94-69028, RTC-Branch 32 upheld the power of the respondent City of Manila, as a local government unit (LGU), to levy the business tax under Section 21(B) of the Manila Revenue Code, as amended, consistent with the basic policy of local autonomy.\u00a0 Ultimately, RTC-Branch 32 decreed:\n\nWHEREFORE, the petitions, the supplemental petitions, and the petitions or complaints in intervention in all these cases are DISMISSED.\n\nAll temporary restraining orders are cancelled, all writs of preliminary injunction are recalled and dissolved, and the injunction bonds cancelled. [14]\nMaersk, APL, Flagship Tankers, CIMC, and CMC (collectively referred to herein as Maersk, et al., ), filed a direct appeal before the Court.\u00a0 Initially, Maersk, et al., , filed a motion for extension of time to file their petition for review on certiorari .\u00a0 Upon filing of said motion, they were assessed docket and legal fees in the amount of P420.00, which they fully paid.\u00a0 The motion for extension of time was granted by the Court in a Resolution [15] dated October 4, 1995.\u00a0 Within the extended period, Maersk, et al., , filed their Petition for Review on Certiorari with prayer for issuance of a writ of preliminary injunction and TRO, [16] docketed as G.R. No. 121613, naming RTC-Branch 32, the City of Manila, Mayor Lim, Vice Mayor Atienza, the Sangguniang Panlungsod ng Maynila, and City Treasurer Acevedo, as respondents.\u00a0 Maersk, et al., , submitted for resolution by the Court a lone question of law, viz .:\n\nWhether or not Section 21(B) of Ordinance No. 7794, otherwise known as the Revenue Code of the City of Manila, as amended by Section 1(G) of Ordinance No. 7807, is valid and constitutional. [17]\n\nMeanwhile, Maersk, et al., , also filed with RTC-Branch 32 a Motion to Stay or Restore Writ of Preliminary Injunction, presenting a Memorandum issued by City Treasurer Acevedo already ordering the collection of the business tax under Section 21(B) of the Manila Revenue Code, as amended.\u00a0 In an Order [18] dated October 16, 1995, RTC-Branch 32 granted the Motion of Maersk, et al., , after finding the same to be meritorious and in conformity with Rule 39, Section 4 of the Rules of Court, on the condition that Maersk, et al., , would increase their injunction bond from P50,000.00 each to P800,000.00 each, or for a total of P4,000,000.00.\u00a0 With this latest development, Maersk, et al., , filed with the Court a Supplemental Petition and Motion praying for the confirmation of the RTC Order dated October 16, 1995 restoring the Writ of Preliminary Injunction and deletion of the name of RTC-Branch 32 from the caption of the Petition in G.R. No. 121613 as the trial court is not a necessary party.\n\nOn October 23, 1995 though, the Court issued a Resolution [19] in G.R. No. 121613 in which it resolved as follows:\n\nOn the basis of the foregoing, the Court RESOLVED to DISMISS the petition for review on certiorari for non-compliance with the above-mentioned requirement no. 1, [Maersk, et al., ,] having failed to remit the amount of P202.00 as payment for the balance of the prescribed legal fees.\n\nAccordingly, the supplemental petition and motion of [Maersk, et al., .,] dated October 17, 1995 praying that the lower court\u2019s order restoring the Writ of Preliminary Injunction be confirmed and that the Regional Trial Court of Manila, Branch 32, be deleted from the caption of the petition for not being a necessary party is NOTED WITHOUT ACTION.\n\nMaersk, et al., , filed a Motion for Reconsideration [20] of the foregoing Resolution dated October 23, 1995 of the Court.\u00a0 Maersk, et al., , argued that the dismissal of their Petition by minute resolution would deprive them of their property rights on mere technical grounds.\u00a0 Maersk, et al., , had no intention of not paying the amount of P202.00, which consisted of sheriff\u2019s fee of P200.00 and clerk\u2019s commission of P2.00, charged in connection with their prayer for the issuance of a preliminary injunction and TRO.\u00a0 While Maersk, et al., , did include such a prayer in their Petition, the same had already become moot and academic after RTC-Branch 32 issued the Order dated October 16, 1995 restoring and reinstating the Writ of Preliminary Injunction in favor of Maersk, et al., In their Supplemental Petition and Motion in G.R. No. 121613, Maersk, et al., , was then only seeking the confirmation by the Court of the Order dated October 16, 1995 of RTC-Branch 32 and, in effect, withdrawing their prayer for the issuance of a writ of preliminary injunction and TRO by the Court.\u00a0 Besides, Maersk, et al., , submitted that the sheriff\u2019s fee of P200.00 and clerk\u2019s commission of P2.00 were not part of the \u201clegal fees\u201d required for perfecting an appeal from the decision of the Court of Appeals or the RTC.\u00a0 The sheriff\u2019s fee and clerk\u2019s commission would merely be \u201cdeposited\u201d with the Court, which implied that said amounts would be \u201crefunded\u201d to Maersk, et al., , in case the Court decided not to issue the TRO prayed for.\u00a0 In fact, when Maersk, et al., , filed their motion for extension of time to file their petition for review on certiorari , they fully paid the docket and legal fees as computed by the cashier of the Court; and when they actually filed their Petition for Review on Certiorari with prayer for issuance of a writ of preliminary injunction and TRO, they were not assessed and required to pay additional legal fees.\u00a0 In any event, Maersk, et al., , had already deposited with the Cashier\u2019s Office of the Court the amount of P202.00.\u00a0 Maersk, et al., , asserted that their case is meritorious and that dismissal is discretionary for the appellate court and discretion must be exercised wisely and prudently, never capriciously, with a view to substantial justice.\u00a0 Consequently, Maersk, et al., , prayed that the Court reconsider its Resolution dated October 23, 1995 and give due course to and squarely resolve their Petition and Supplemental Petition and Motion in G.R. No. 121613.\n\nCounsel for Maersk, et al., , subsequently submitted a joint Memorandum [21] for the petitioners in G.R. Nos. 121613, 122333, and 122349.\n\nG.R. No. 121675\n\nEastern Shipping was the petitioner in Civil Case No. 94-69028, which was consolidated with Civil Case Nos. 94-68861, 94-68862, 94-68863, 94-68919, 94-68936, 94-68939, 94-68940, and 94-68941, before RTC-Branch 32.\n\nSince the Decision dated August 28, 1995 of RTC-Branch 32 in the consolidated cases was contrary to its interest, Eastern Shipping appealed the same before the Court through a Petition for Review on Certiorari with Prayer for Preliminary Injunction and/or Temporary Restraining Order, [22] with the City Council of Manila, the Mayor of Manila, and the City of Manila, as respondents.\u00a0 In its Petition, docketed as G.R. No. 121675, Eastern Shipping raised pure questions of law and argued two fundamental issues:\n\nWHETHER OR NOT SECTION 21 OF [THE MANILA REVENUE CODE, AS AMENDED,] IS VALID AND CONSTITUTIONAL.\n\nIN THE REMOTE POSSIBILITY THAT THE QUESTIONED ORDINANCE IS DECLARED VALID AND CONSTITUTIONAL, WHETHER OR NOT [EASTERN SHIPPING] IS LIABLE TO PAY THE BUSINESS TAX BASED ON GROSS RECEIPTS DERIVED FROM INCOMING FREIGHTS ONLY OR OUTGOING FREIGHTS ONLY OR BOTH. [23]\nThe Office of the City Legal Officer, on behalf of the City of Manila, Mayor Lim, Vice Mayor Atienza, the City Council of Manila/Sangguniang Panlungsod ng Maynila, and City Treasurer Acevedo, filed a joint Comment [24] on the Petitions in G.R. Nos. 121675, 121720-28, and 121847-55.\u00a0 Eastern Shipping later on filed its Memorandum. [25]\n\nG.R. No. 121704\n\nWilliam Lines, Negros Navigation, Lorenzo Shipping, Gothong Lines, the Aboitiz Group, and Solid Shipping (collectively referred to herein as William Lines, et al., ) are duly organized domestic corporations principally engaged in the business of operating domestic shipping vessels for the transportation of cargoes and passengers, except Aboitiz Air Transport Corp., which is engaged in the transportation of cargoes by air, and Aboitiz Haulers, Inc. which is engaged in the business of domestic freight and hauling by land.\u00a0 William Lines, et al., , all have principal addresses in Manila.\n\nWilliam Lines, et al., , paid under protest to the City of Manila the business taxes assessed against them for the first quarter of 1994, based on Section 21(B) of the Manila Revenue Code, as amended.\u00a0 They were intervenors in Civil Case Nos. 94-68861, 94-68862, 94-68863, 94-68919, 94-68936, 94-68939, 94-68940, 94-68941, and 94-69028, before RTC-Branch 32.\n\nWilliam Lines, et al., , challenged the Decision dated August 28, 1995 rendered by RTC-Branch 32 in said civil cases through a Petition for Review on Certiorari with Prayer for Issuance of a Preliminary Injunction and for a Temporary Restraining Order, [26] docketed as G.R. No. 121704.\u00a0 They identified as respondents the City of Manila, Mayor Lim, Vice Mayor Atienza, City Treasurer Acevedo, the Sangguniang Panlungsod ng Maynila, and RTC-Branch 32 Presiding Judge Juan C. Nabong, Jr. (Nabong).\u00a0 William Lines, et al., , assigned three major errors purportedly committed by RTC-Branch 32:\n\nA. The RTC erred in failing to declare the aforecited Section 21(B) of [the Manila Revenue Code, as amended, as] ultra vires and therefore null and void because such sections violate the Provisions of the LGC x x x.\n\nx x x x\n\nB.\u00a0 The RTC erred in holding that Sec. 143(h) which is an omnibus grant of power couched in general terms is the exception referred or adverted to in Section 133(j) of the LGC.\n\nC.\u00a0 The RTC erred in holding that there are only four basic requirements for a valid exercise of the power of the City of Manila to levy tax. [27]\nIn their Memorandum, [28] William Lines, et al., , focused their discussion on the following issues:\n\nIS COMPLIANCE WITH THE GUIDELINES AND LIMITATIONS SET FORTH IN BOOK II TITLE I OF THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT [CODE] (LGC) NECESSARY FOR THE VALIDITY OF SEC. 21(B) OF [THE MANILA REVENUE CODE, AS AMENDED]?\n\nDID SEC. 21(B) OF [THE MANILA REVENUE CODE, AS AMENDED] VIOLATE SUCH GUIDELINES AND LIMITATIONS OF THE LGC?\n\nIS SEC. 21(B) OF [THE MANILA REVENUE CODE, AS AMENDED,] INVALID, ULTRA VIRES AND UNLAWFUL?

[31]\n\nAs mentioned previously, the Office of the City Legal Officer, on behalf of the City of Manila, Mayor Lim, Vice Mayor Atienza, the City Council of Manila/Sangguniang Panlungsod ng Maynila, and City Treasurer Acevedo, filed a joint Comment on the Petitions in G.R. Nos. 121675, 121720-28, and 121847-55.\n\nPSTC filed its Memorandum, [32] summing up its issues and arguments, to wit:\n\nISSUES SUBMITTED FOR RESOLUTION\n\n1.

No. 122333.\u00a0 In their Petition, Cosco, et al., , presented for resolution of the Court the principal issue of whether or not Section 21(B) of the Manila Revenue Code, as amended, is constitutional.\u00a0 Cosco, et al., , posited that Section 21(B) of the Manila Revenue Code, as amended, is unconstitutional and void ab initio because it was enacted by the Sangguniang Panlungsod ng Maynila, which was presided over by Vice Mayor Atienza, approved by Mayor Lim, and implemented and enforced by City Treasurer Acevedo, ultra vires and in violation of constitutional and statutory limitations on the taxing power of LGUs.\u00a0 Hence, Cosco, et al., , prayed for the issuance of a writ of prohibition to restrain, enjoin, and prohibit respondents City of Manila, Mayor Lim, Vice Mayor Atienza, Sangguniang Panlungsod, and City Treasurer Acevedo, from enforcing Section 21(B) of the Manila Revenue Code, as amended.\n\nA joint Memorandum was filed on behalf of the petitioners in G.R. Nos. 121613, 122333, and 122349.\n\nG.R. No. 122335\n\nSulpicio Lines, Inc. (Sulpicio Lines) is a domestic corporation, holding office in North Harbor, Manila, whose principal business is the operation of domestic shipping vessels for the transportation of cargoes and passengers.\n\nSulpicio Lines and Gothong Lines jointly filed a complaint for declaratory relief with prayer for the issuance of a writ of preliminary injunction, which was docketed as Civil Case No. 94-69141 and raffled to RTC-Branch 44.\u00a0 Sulpicio Lines and Gothong Lines asked the trial court to determine the validity of Section 21(B) of the Manila Revenue Code, as amended, as well as the rights and duties of said shipping companies thereunder.\u00a0 However, after being informed that Maersk already filed a similar case, i.e., Civil Case No. 94-68861 before RTC-Branch 32, Gothong Lines decided to withdraw as complainant in Civil Case No. 94-69141 and simply intervene in Civil Case No. 94-68861.\u00a0 As a result, Sulpicio Lines became the sole complainant in Civil Case No. 94-69141.\u00a0 Sulpicio Lines then filed a Motion to Consolidate Civil Case No. 94-69141 with Civil Case No. 94-68861 which was granted.\n\nOn August 28, 1995, RTC-Branch 32 rendered a Decision in Civil Case Nos. 94-68861, 94-68862, 94-68863, 94-68919, 94-68936, 94-68939, 94-68940, 94-68941, and 94-69028.\u00a0 Civil Case No. 94-69141 was not included in the caption of the Decision, although the complaint of Sulpicio Lines was mentioned in the body of the same Decision.\n\nSulpicio Lines did not formally receive a copy of the aforementioned Decision dated August 28, 1995 of RTC-Branch 32 and was merely informed of the same by the petitioners/intervenors in the other civil cases.\u00a0 This prompted Sulpicio Lines to file with RTC-Branch 32 a Motion for Clarificatory Order seeking to verify if said Decision included and was binding on Sulpicio Lines.\u00a0 Acting on the Motion of Sulpicio Lines, RTC-Branch 32 issued an Order [39] on October 16, 1995, which reads:\n\nAlthough Civil Case No. 94-64191 is not included in the caption of the above Decision, the Decision against all the petitioners, intervenors, most specifically against intervenor Carlos A. Gothong Lines, Inc. is binding and enforceable against Sulpicio Lines, Inc. because Civil Case No. 94-64191 had been consolidated with Civil Case No. 94-68861.\n\nWHEREFORE, the Decision and the dispositive portion of the Decision rendered on August 28, 1995, shall apply to and binds Sulpicio Lines, Inc. x x x.\nAfter Sulpicio Lines confirmed that the Decision dated August 28, 1995 of RTC-Branch 32 in Civil Case Nos. 94-68861, 94-68862, 94-68863, 94-68919, 94-68936, 94-68939, 94-68940, 94-68941, and 94-69028, was also applicable to and binding upon it, it filed with the Court a Petition for Review on Certiorari with Prayer for Issuance of a Preliminary Injunction and for a Temporary Restraining Order, [40] against the City of Manila, Mayor Lim, Vice Mayor Atienza, City Treasurer Acevedo, the Sangguniang Panlungsod ng Maynila, and Presiding Judge Nabong of RTC-Branch 32.\u00a0 The appeal of Sulpicio Lines was docketed as G.R. No. 122335.\n\nThe assignment of errors in the Petition of Sulpicio Lines was the same as that in the Petition of William Lines, et al., , in G.R. No. 121704, viz.:\n\nA. The RTC erred in failing to declare that the aforecited Section 21(B) of [the Manila Revenue Code, as amended, as] ultra vires and therefore null and void because such sections of the Ordinances of the City of Manila violate the Provisions of the LGC x x x\n\nx x x x\n\nB.\u00a0 The RTC erred in holding that Sec. 143(h) which is an omnibus grant of power couched in general terms is the exception referred or adverted to in Section 133(j) of the LGC.\n\nC.\u00a0 The RTC erred in holding that there are only four basic requirements for a valid exercise of the power of the City of Manila to levy tax. [41]\nOn January 31, 1996, the Court issued a Resolution [42] referring the Petition of Sulpicio Lines in G.R. No. 122335 to the Court of Appeals for proper determination and disposition pursuant to Section 9, paragraph 3 of Batas Pambansa Blg. 129, which granted the Court of Appeals \u201cexclusive appellate jurisdiction over all final judgments, decisions, resolutions, orders or awards of Regional Trial Courts and quasi-judicial agencies, instrumentalities, boards or commission.\u201d\n\nAt the Court of Appeals, the Petition of Sulpicio Lines was docketed as CA-G.R. SP No. 39973.\u00a0 In a Resolution [43] dated April 12, 1996, the appellate court directed the respondents City of Manila, Mayor Lim, Vice Mayor Atienza, City Treasurer Acevedo, the Sangguniang Panlungsod ng Maynila, and Presiding Judge Nabong of RTC-Branch 32, to file their Comments.\n\nIn the meantime, Sulpicio Lines filed with the Court in G.R. No. 122335 a Motion for Reconsideration of the Resolution dated January 31, 1996 and for Consolidation. [44] Sulpicio Lines prayed that the Resolution dated January 31, 1996 of the Court in G.R. No. 122335 be withdrawn; that the rollo of G.R. No. 122335 be transmitted back to the Court; and that G.R. No. 122335 be consolidated with the other cases pending before the Court en banc questioning the Decision dated August 28, 1995 of RTC-Branch 32 which upheld the constitutionality and validity of Section 21(B) of the Manila Revenue Code, as amended.\n\nAfter several copies of its Resolutions were returned unserved on the respondents in G.R. Nos. 122335, 122349, and 124855, the Court issued a Resolution [45] on December 2, 1997 dispensing with the filing of a Comment by the respondents in the three cases.\n\nG.R. No. 122349\n\nThe Association of International Shipping Lines, Inc.

No. 122349, was substantially similar to the Petition of Cosco, et al., , in G.R. No. 122333.\n\nIn its Resolution dated December 2, 1997, the Court dispensed with the filing of a Comment by the respondents in G.R. Nos. 122335, 122349, and 124855.\n\nThe only other pleading in G.R. No. 122349 is a joint Memorandum filed on behalf of the petitioners in G.R. Nos. 121613, 122333, and 122349.\n\nG.R. No. 124855\n\nDongnama and Kyowa are foreign corporations, organized and existing under the laws of the Republic of Korea and Japan, respectively.\u00a0 Both shipping companies are doing business in the Philippines through their resident agent, Sky International, Inc. (Sky International), with office in Binondo, Manila.\n\nDongnama and Kyowa, through Sky International, lodged a petition to declare unconstitutional Section 21(B) of the Manila Revenue Code, as amended, with prayer for a writ of preliminary injunction and TRO, docketed as Civil Case No. 94-68936 and initially raffled to RTC-Branch 47, but later consolidated with Civil Case Nos. 94-68861, 94-68862, 94-68863, 94-68919, 94-68939, 94-68940, 94-68941, and 94-69028 before RTC-Branch 32.\u00a0 On August 28, 1995, RTC-Branch 32 rendered its Decision in the consolidated civil cases upholding the constitutionality and validity of Section 21(B) of the Manila Revenue Code, as amended.\n\nDongnama and Kyowa then filed with the Court a Petition for Certiorari with Urgent Prayer for Restraining Order, seeking the annulment or modification of the foregoing Decision of RTC-Branch 32.\u00a0 The Petition was docketed as G.R. No. 122120.\u00a0 Instead of consolidating G.R. No. 122120 with the other pending cases that challenge the constitutionality and validity of Section 21(B) of the Manila Revenue Code, as amended, the Court issued a Resolution dated October 23, 1995 referring the Petition in G.R. No. 122120 to the Court of Appeals for the following reason:\n\nConsidering that under Section 19 (sic), paragraph (1) of Batas Pambansa Blg. 129, the Court of Appeals now exercises original jurisdiction to issue writs of mandamus, prohibitions, certiorari , habeas corpus, and quo warranto, and auxiliary writs or processes, whether or not in aid of its appellate jurisdiction, the Court resolved to REFER this case to the Court of Appeals, for disposition. [47]\nThe Petition for Certiorari of Dongnama and Kyowa was docketed as CA-G.R. SP No. 39188 before the Court of Appeals.\u00a0 The Court of Appeals rendered its Decision [48] in CA-G.R. SP No. 39188 on March 29, 1996, finding no merit in the Petition of Dongnama and Kyowa as RTC-Branch 32 did not act with grave abuse of discretion when it ruled in its Decision dated August 28, 1995 that Section 21(B) of the Manila Revenue Code, as amended, is valid and in clear conformity with the law and the Constitution.\u00a0 In the end, the appellate court adjudged:\n\nWHEREFORE, IN VIEW OF THE FOREGOING, the instant petition is hereby DENIED for lack of merit. [49]\nDongnama and Kyowa went back before the Court \u201cby way of Petition for Review on Certiorari under Rule 65 of the Rules of Court,\u201d docketed as G.R. No. 124355, based on a lone assignment of error:\n\nRESPONDENT COURT OF APPEALS GRAVELY ABUSED ITS DISCRETION IN ASSUMING JURISDICTION OVER SUPREME COURT G.R.

SUPREME COURT HAS EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION. [50]\nDongnama and Kyowa specifically prayed:\n\n1. That this petition be given due course;\n\n2. That the Decision dated 29 March 1996 be annulled and set aside pending the resolution of the same to be decided together with other related cases by this Court;\n\n3. That respondent\u2019s Court of Appeals jurisdiction over the instant case be limited to the issue on the propriety of the prayer for preliminary injunction and restraining order in relation to the assailed Decision dated 28 August 1995 by RTC-Manila, Branch 32. [51]\nThe Court, in a Resolution dated December 2, 1997, dispensed with the filing of a Comment by the respondents in G.R. Nos. 122335, 122349, and 124855.\n\nDongnama and Kyowa eventually filed a Memorandum. [52]\n\nConsolidation of the 10 Petitions\n\nThe foregoing 10 cases were consolidated at different times and stages. [53]\n\nOn December 2, 1997, the Court issued a Resolution [54] giving due course to the Petitions and requiring the parties to simultaneously file their Memoranda within 20 days from notice.\n\nAmong the parties to the 10 Petitions, Maersk, et al., ; Eastern Shipping; William Lines, et al., ; PSTC; Cosco, et al., ; AISL; and Dongnama and Kyowa (petitioners in G.R. Nos. 121613, 121675, 121704, 121720-28, 122333, 122349, and 124855, respectively) complied with the Resolution dated December 2, 1997 and submitted their Memoranda.\n\nIn a Resolution [55] dated April 23, 2002, the Court resolved to consider the cases submitted for deliberation.\n\nThe Court issued a Resolution [56] on July 5, 2011 requiring the parties to the 10 cases to move in the premises.\n\nA copy of the Resolution dated July 5, 2011 was served upon and received by Atty. Renato G. Dela Cruz (Dela Cruz), City Legal Officer of Manila, on behalf of the City of Manila, Mayor Lim, Vice Mayor Atienza, the City Council of Manila/Sangguniang Panlungsod ng Maynila, and City Treasurer Acevedo, the petitioners in G.R. No. 120051 and respondents in the other nine cases.\n\nAtty. Dela Cruz filed a Manifestation [57] informing the Court that despite exerting effort, he could no longer locate the records for the 10 cases.\u00a0 The former lawyers who handled the cases had long ceased to be connected with the City of Manila and both were already deceased.\u00a0 Thus, Atty. Dela Cruz prayed that he be furnished copies of the petitions and pleadings in the cases and be given a fresh period of 10 days from receipt thereof to submit his compliance with the Resolution dated July 5, 2011.\u00a0 The Court granted Atty. Cruz\u2019s prayer in a Resolution [58] dated April 24, 2012.\u00a0 Atty. Dela Cruz once more moved for an extension of time to comply with the Resolution dated July 5, 2011, which the Court granted in a Resolution [59] dated November 20, 2012.\n\nIn a Resolution [60] dated July 16, 2013, the Court took notice that Atty. Dela Cruz failed to comply with the Resolution dated July 5, 2011 within the extended period which expired on November 8, 2012.\u00a0 Resultantly, the Court resolved to require Atty. Dela Cruz to (a) show cause why he should not be disciplinarily dealt with or held in contempt for such failure; and (b) comply with the Resolution dated July 5, 2011, both within 10 days from notice.\n\nAtty. Sitro G. Tajonera (Tajonera) of the Office of the City Legal Officer of Manila filed a Manifestation and Motion for Leave to Withdraw Petition in G.R. No. 120051 [61] dated August 12, 2013.\u00a0 Atty. Tajonera moved for the withdrawal of the Petition in G.R. No. 120051 on the ground that the issues therein had been rendered moot and academic by the Decisions of the Court in Coca-Cola Bottlers Philippines, Inc. v. City of Manila [62] and City of Manila v. Coca-Cola Bottlers Philippines, Inc. [63] (Coca-Cola cases), which declared with finality the unconstitutionality of Section 21 of the Manila Revenue Code, as amended.\n\nAtty. Dela Cruz likewise filed a Compliance with the Court\u2019s Show Cause Resolution dated July 16, 2013.\u00a0 According to Atty. Dela Cruz, he already resigned as City Legal Officer of Manila effective May 31, 2013.\u00a0 Still, Atty. Dela Cruz explained:\n\nc. Due to the multifarious duties that undersigned attended to and the many legal problems that confronted the Mayor whom he had to assist in resolving them, he inadvertently overlooked the deadline set for submission of his compliance of the Court\u2019s directive which in fact lapsed without him having been reminded by Atty. Karen Peralta of the unfulfilled obligation to this Honorable Court.\n\nd. For this, he acknowledges that he was remiss in his duty to the Court and in delegating it to another.\n\n[e.] Undersigned begs the Court\u2019s clemency on his inability to submit the pleading required of him and his fault in relying on his subordinate-lawyer to assist him in complying with the Court\u2019s directive.\n\n[f.] Undersigned assures the Court that henceforth, he shall not commit the same mistake or any neglect of duty or lack of respect to the Court. [64]\nII\nARGUMENTS OF THE PARTIES\n\nThere is only one vital issue in all the 10 cases: Whether or not Section 21(B) of the Manila Revenue Code, as amended, was in conformity with the Constitution and the laws and, therefore, valid.\n\nThere are two fundamental and opposing positions on the issue.\u00a0 Presented below are summaries of the arguments in support of each.\n\nSection 21(B) of the Manila Revenue\nCode, as amended, was constitutional\nand valid.\n\nThe City of Manila, Mayor Lim, Vice Mayor Atienza, the Sangguniang Panlungsod ng Maynila, and City Treasurer Acevedo argued that Section 21(B) was constitutional and valid.\u00a0 RTC-Branch 32, in its Decision dated August 28, 1995 in Civil Case Nos. 94-68861, 94-68862, 94-68863, 94-68919, 94-68936, 94-68939, 94-68940, 94-68941, and 94-69028, and the Court of Appeals, in its Decision dated March 29, 1996 in CA-G.R. SP No. 39188, adopted the same position.\n\nThe 1987 Constitution granted LGUs the power to create their own sources of revenue and to levy taxes, fees, and charges subject to the guidelines and limitations provided by Congress, consistent with the policy of local autonomy.\u00a0 This grant was reiterated in Section 129 of the LGC and the scope of tax powers of a city such as Manila is described in Section 151 also of the LGC.\u00a0 Hence, the Constitution and Congress, through the LGC, expressly granted LGUs the general power to tax.\n\nThe enactment of Section 21(B) of the Manila Revenue Code, as amended, is statutorily ingrained.\u00a0 It is based on the exempting clause at the beginning of Section 133, in conjunction with Section 143(h), of the LGC.\u00a0 The relevant provisions of the Code are reproduced below:\n\nSEC. 133. Common Limitations on the Taxing Powers of Local Government Units. \u2013 Unless otherwise provided herein , the exercise of the taxing powers of provinces, cities, municipalities, and barangays shall not extend to the levy of the following:\n\nx x x x\n\n(j) Taxes on the gross receipts of transportation contractors and persons engaged in the transportation of passengers or freight by hire and common carriers by air, land or water, except as provided in this Code;\n\nSEC. 143. Tax on Business . \u2013 The municipality may impose taxes on the following businesses:\n\nx x x x\n\n(h) On any business, not otherwise specified in the preceding paragraphs , which the sanggunian concerned may deem proper to tax: Provided , That on any business subject to the excise, value-added or percentage tax under the National Internal Revenue Code, as amended , the rate of tax shall not exceed two percent (2%) of gross sales or receipts of the preceding calendar year.\n\nThe sanggunian concerned may prescribe a schedule of graduated tax rates but in no case to exceed the rates prescribed herein. (Emphases supplied.)\nInasmuch as \u201ctransportation contractors, persons who transport passenger or freight for hire, and common carriers by land, air or water,\u201d are engaged in business subject to excise, value added, or percentage tax under the National Internal Revenue Code (NIRC), as amended, then the City of Manila could lawfully levy local business tax under Section 21(B) of the Manila Revenue Code, as amended.\u00a0 It is irrelevant which of Sections 133(j) and 143(h) of the LGC is the special or general provision since there is an exempting clause in Section 133, that is, \u201cUnless otherwise provided herein,\u201d which means that even if the businesses enumerated therein are exempted from the levy of local tax, if there is a provision to the contrary, such as Section 143(h), the Sanggunian concerned could still impose the local tax.\u00a0 As an alternative argument, Section 133(j) of the LGC is the general provision on the limitations on the taxing power of the LGUs, while Section 143(h) of the LGC is the specific provision on the businesses which the LGUs could tax; and per the rules of statutory construction, the latter prevails over the former.\u00a0 To rule otherwise and adopt the construction put forward by the opposing parties would render Section 143(h) of the LGC a hollow decorative provision with no subject to tax.\n\nMoreover, the business tax imposed by Section 21(B) of the Manila Revenue Code, as amended, complied with the limitations and conditions in the LGC for a valid local tax:\u00a0 (1) The rate of tax did not exceed 2% of gross sales or receipts of the preceding calendar year; (2) The tax is consistent with the basic policy of local autonomy; (3) The tax is not unjust, excessive, oppressive, confiscatory, or contrary to declared national policy; and (4) That a prior public hearing was conducted for the purpose of enacting the Manila Revenue Code, as amended.\n\nSection 21(B) of the Manila Revenue Code, as amended, also enjoyed the presumption of constitutionality and validity.\u00a0 This presumption can only be overridden by overwhelming evidence to the contrary.\u00a0 In Drilon v. Lim , [65] the Court already declared the Manila Revenue Code as valid given that the procedural requirements for the enactment of the same had been observed.\n\nLastly, taxes are the lifeblood of the nation.\u00a0 Tax exemptions are construed strictly against the taxpayer, and the burden is upon the person claiming exemption from the tax to show a clear grant of exemption by organic law or statute.\n\nSection 21(B) of the Manila Revenue\nCode, as amended, was null and void\nfor being contrary to the Constitution\nand the LGC.\n\nOn the other end of the spectrum, MAS; Maersk, et al., ; Eastern Shipping; William Lines, et al., ; PSTC; OFSI; Cosco, et al., ; Sulpicio Lines; AISL; and Dongnama and Kyowa, asserted that Section 21(B) of the Manila Revenue Code, as amended, was null and void because it violated the Constitution and the LGC.\u00a0 It was the position affirmed by RTC-Branch 43 in its Decision dated April 3, 1995 in Civil Case No. 94-69052.\n\nUnder the Philippine system of government, the power of taxation, while inherent in the State in view of its sovereign prerogatives, is not inherent in municipal corporations or LGUs.\u00a0 LGUs may exercise the power only if and to the extent that it is delegated to them.\u00a0 One of the common limitations on the power to tax of LGUs is Section 133(j) of the LGC, carried over from the Local Tax Code of 1973.\n\nSection 133(j) expressly states that the taxing powers of the LGUs shall not extend to the transportation business.\u00a0 Section 133(j) of the LGC is a special provision, which prevails over Section 143(h) of the same Code, a general provision.\u00a0 This interpretation would give effect to both Sections 133(j) and 143(h) of the LGC, and contrary to the assertion of the City of Manila and its public officials, would not render Section 143(h) useless, meaningless, and nugatory.\u00a0 There are other businesses which the LGUs may tax under Section 143(h).\u00a0 Besides, in case of any doubt, any tax ordinance or revenue measure shall be construed strictly against the LGU enacting it and liberally in favor of the taxpayer, for taxes, being burdens, are not to be presumed beyond what the applicable statute expressly and clearly declares.\n\nIn addition, although Section 21(B) of the Manila Revenue Code, as amended, imposed what was denominated as a \u201cbusiness tax,\u201d in reality it was a percentage or sales tax.\u00a0 Business tax is imposed on the privilege of doing business, though it may be computed as a percentage of gross sales. For business tax, there is no set ratio between volume of sales and the amount of tax.\u00a0 Cities and municipalities are given the power to impose business tax under Section 143(h) of the LGC.\u00a0 In contrast, percentage or sales tax is based on gross sales or receipts.\u00a0 The percentage bears a direct relationship to the sales or receipts generated by a business, without regard for the extent of operation or size of the business.\u00a0 Cities and municipalities may validly impose a tax on business, but consonant with the limitations on local taxation, they may not impose percentage or sales tax on top of what is already imposed in the NIRC.\u00a0 Section 21(B) of the Manila Revenue Code, as amended, imposing on \u201ctransportation contractors, persons who transport passenger or freight for hire, and common carriers by land, air or water,\u201d a tax of 50% of 1% of the gross sales or receipts from the preceding year on top of the national taxes already imposed by the NIRC was unjust, unfair, excessive, confiscatory, and in restraint of economic trade.\n\nAnd finally, Section 21(B) of the Manila Revenue Code, as amended, violated the rule on uniformity in taxation.\u00a0 Uniformity in taxation should not be construed in a pure geographical sense, i.e. , that the questioned tax was imposed with the same force and effect on all businesses located in Manila.\u00a0 Shipping companies should be differentiated from other businesses.\u00a0 Aside from the risks and responsibilities the shipping companies shoulder, their services are not confined within the territorial limits of Manila alone but extend to other parts of the world.\u00a0 It is not uniformity for the shipping companies to be classed and taxed under the same category with other common carriers domiciled and plying Manila territory 24 hours a day.\n\nIII\nRULING OF THE COURT\n\nResolution of pending incidents in\nseveral cases.\n\nBefore delving into the merits of the 10 cases, there are pending incidents in three cases that first need to be addressed:\n\n(1) G.R. No. 120051 :\u00a0 The City Legal Officer of Manila, as counsel for the City of Manila, Mayor Lim, and City Treasurer Acevedo, petitioners in G.R. No. 120051, filed a Manifestation and Motion for Leave to Withdraw Petition in G.R. No. 120051, on the ground that the issues therein had been rendered moot and academic by the Decisions of the Court in the Coca-Cola cases, which declared with finality the unconstitutionality of Section 21 of the Manila Revenue Code, as amended.\n\nThe Court resolves to deny the motion to withdraw.\n\nThere already had been an exchange of pleadings between the parties in G.R. No. 120051, i.e., Petition, Comment, and Reply.\u00a0 In a Resolution dated December 2, 1997, the Court also already considered G.R. No. 120051 and all the other nine consolidated cases submitted for deliberation.\u00a0 At this stage, the decision to grant or not to grant the motion to withdraw is fully within the discretion of the Court. [66]\n\nThe Court denies the motion to withdraw because the assertion by the City Legal Officer of Manila that the Coca-Cola cases already rendered the issues in G.R. No. 120051 moot and academic is erroneous.\u00a0 The Court did not declare in the Coca-Cola cases that Section 21 of the Manila Revenue Code, as amended, was unconstitutional.\u00a0 What the Court held in the two Coca-Cola cases was that Ordinance Nos. 7988 and 8011 (approved by then Mayor Atienza on February 25, 2000 and February 22, 2001, respectively), amending Section 21 of the Manila Revenue Code, were null and void for (a) failure to comply with the publication requirement for tax ordinances under Section 188 of the LGC; and (b) deletion of an exempting proviso found in Section 143(h) of the LGC and the prior Section 21 of the Manila Revenue Code, which opened the door to the double taxation of Coca-Cola.\u00a0 Section 21 of the Manila Revenue Code, as it was amended by Ordinance No. 7807, and more specifically, paragraph (B) thereof, was not the subject of a constitutional review by the Court in the Coca-Cola cases.\n\nAs for Atty. Dela Cruz\u2019s Compliance with the Court\u2019s Show Cause Resolution, the Court finds the same satisfactory, although he is reminded to be more conscientious of his duties as legal counsel in the future, despite the heavy volume of his work load.\n\n(2) G.R. No. 121613 :\u00a0 In a Resolution dated October 23, 1995, the Court dismissed the Petition of Maersk, et al., , for the latter\u2019s failure to deposit sheriff\u2019s fee and clerk\u2019s commission in the total amount of P202.00; and in light of said dismissal, noted without action the Supplemental Petition and Motion of Maersk, et al., , praying for the confirmation of the Writ of Preliminary Injunction restored by RTC-Branch 32 and deletion of RTC-Branch 32 from the caption of G.R. No. 121613 for not being a necessary party.\u00a0 In their pending Motion for Reconsideration of the Resolution dated October 23, 1995, Maersk, et al., , prayed that the Court give due course to and squarely resolve their Petition and Supplemental Petition and Motion.\n\nThe Court resolves to grant the Motion for Reconsideration of Maersk, et al., It sets aside the Resolution dated October 23, 1995; reinstates the Petition of Maersk, et al., , in G.R. No. 121613; and gives due course to the Petition and Supplemental Petition and Motion of Maersk, et al., , in the said case.\n\nOf particular relevance to the plight of Maersk, et al., , herein is the following discussion of the Court in Ayala Land, Inc. v. Carpo [67] :\n\nTo be sure, the remedy of appeal is a purely statutory right and one who seeks to avail thereof must comply with the statute or rule.\u00a0 For this reason, payment of the full amount of the appellate court docket and other lawful fees within the reglementary period is mandatory and jurisdictional. However, as we have ruled in Aranas v. Endona , the strict application of the jurisdictional nature of the above rule on payment of appellate docket fees may be mitigated under exceptional circumstances to better serve the interest of justice.\u00a0 As early as 1946, in the case of Segovia v. Barrios , we ruled that where an appellant in good faith paid less than the correct amount for the docket fee because that was the amount he was required to pay by the clerk of court, and he promptly paid the balance, it is error to dismiss his appeal because \u2013\nevery citizen has the right to assume and trust that a public officer charged by law with certain duties knows his duties and performs them in accordance with law. To penalize such citizen for relying upon said officer in all good faith is repugnant to justice.\nThe ruling in Segovia was applied by this Court in subsequent cases where an appellant\u2019s right to appeal was threatened by the mistake of public officers in computing the correct amount of docket fee. Respondents draw attention to Rule 41, \u00a74 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure which provides that the appellate court docket and other lawful fees must be paid in full to the clerk of the court which rendered the judgment or final order appealed from within the period for taking the appeal.\u00a0 They argue that this Rule has overruled the decision in Segovia.\n\nThis contention is untenable. Rule 41, \u00a74 must be read in relation to Rule 50, \u00a71(c) which provides that:\nAn appeal may be dismissed by the Court of Appeals, on its own motion or on that of the appellee, on the following grounds:\n\nx x x x\n\n(c)\u00a0 Failure of the appellant to pay the docket and other lawful fees as provided in Section 4 of Rule 41.\n\nx x x x\nWith the exception of \u00a71(b), which refers to the failure to file notice of appeal or the record on appeal within the period prescribed by these Rules, the grounds enumerated in Rule 50, \u00a71 are merely directory and not mandatory. This is plain from the use of the permissive \u201cmay\u201d in the text of the statute. Despite the jurisdictional nature of the rule on payment of docket fee, therefore, the appellate court still has the discretion to relax the rule in meritorious cases. The ruling in Segovia is still good law which the appellate court, in the exercise of its discretion, must apply in circumstances such as that in the present case where an appellant was, from the start, ready and willing to pay the correct amount of docket fee, but was unable to do so due to the error of an officer of the court in computing the correct amount. To hold otherwise would be unjust and unwarranted. (Citations omitted.)\nThe Court notes that Revised Circular No. 1-88, effective July 1, 1991, which was cited in the Resolution dated October 23, 1995 as basis for the dismissal of the Petition of Maersk, et al., , also used the word \u201cmay\u201d in the first paragraph thereof:\n\n(1) Payment of docketing and other fees. \u2013 Section 1 of Rule 45 requires that petitions for review be filed and the required fees paid within the prescribed period. Unless exempted by law or rule, such fees must be fully paid in accordance with this Circular; otherwise, the Court may deny the petition outright. The same rule shall govern petitions under Rule 65. (Emphasis supplied.)\nHence, denial of the petition for review outright for failure to pay docketing and other fees within the prescribed period was also directory and not mandatory upon the Court under Revised Circular No. 1-88.\n\nIn the exercise of its discretion, the Court determines that there was meritorious reason why Maersk, et al., , paid docket and other legal fees within the prescribed period, but short of the P202.00 for sheriff\u2019s fee and clerk\u2019s commission.\u00a0 Maersk, et al., , were already assessed and required to pay the docket and legal fees when they filed their Motion for Extension of Time to File Petition for Review on Certiorari. The Motion did not yet indicate that the intended Petition would include a prayer for a TRO, so the receiving clerk did not assess Maersk, et al., , for sheriff\u2019s fee and clerk\u2019s commission.\u00a0 When Maersk, et al., , actually filed their Petition with prayer for the issuance of a writ of preliminary injunction and TRO, they were no longer assessed additional fees by the receiving clerk.\u00a0 Maersk, et al., , found out about the deficiency in their legal fees upon their receipt of the Resolution dated October 23, 1995 already dismissing their Petition and noting without action their Supplemental Petition and Motion.\u00a0 Maersk, et al., , immediately filed a Motion for Reconsideration of said Resolution, and also deposited their balance of P202.00 with the Court.\n\nGiven the circumstances, Maersk, et al., , cannot be faulted for their failure to pay the required legal fees for such failure was clearly not a dilatory tactic nor intended to circumvent the Rules of Court.\u00a0 On the contrary, the subsequent payment by Maersk, et al., , of the P202.00 deficiency even before the Court had passed upon their Motion for Reconsideration was indicative of their good faith and willingness to comply with the Rules. [68]\n\nActing on the Supplemental Petition and Motion of Maersk, et al., , the Court further resolves to NOTE WITHOUT ACTION the prayer to confirm the Writ of Preliminary Injunction restored by RTC-Branch 32 in light of the present judgment, and to GRANT the prayer to delete RTC-Branch 32 from the caption of the case as it was not a necessary party.\n\n(3) G.R. No. 122335 : In a Resolution dated January 31, 1996, the Court referred the Petition of Sulpicio Lines to the Court of Appeals.\u00a0 There is a pending Motion for Reconsideration of the Resolution dated January 31, 1996 filed by Sulpicio Lines seeking the withdrawal of the Resolution dated January 31, 1996 and transmittal of the rollo of G.R. No. 122335 from the Court of Appeals back to the Court.\n\nThe Court resolves to grant the Motion for Reconsideration of Sulpicio Lines.\u00a0 It sets aside the Resolution dated January 31, 1996 and gives due course to the Petition of Sulpicio Lines in G.R. No. 122335.\n\nThe Petition for Review on Certiorari of Sulpicio Lines, filed under Rule 42 of the old Rules of Court, should not have been referred to the Court of Appeals.\u00a0 It is true that under Section 9, paragraph (3) of Batas Pambansa Blg. 129, the Court of Appeals has \u201c(e)xclusive appellate jurisdiction over all final judgments, resolutions, orders or awards of Regional Trial Courts x x x.\u201d However,\u00a0 Rule\u00a0 42\u00a0 of\u00a0 the\u00a0 old\u00a0 Rules\u00a0 of\u00a0 Court,\u00a0 then in effect, allowed an appeal straight from the RTC (formerly called Court of First Instance) to the Supreme Court when the appeal raised pure questions of law:\n\nRULE 42\nAPPEAL FROM COURTS OF FIRST INSTANCE\nTO SUPREME COURT\n\nSection 1. Procedure . \u2013 The procedure of appeal to the Supreme Court from Courts of First Instance shall be governed by the same rules governing appeals to the Court of Appeals, except as hereinafter provided.\n\nSection 2. Appeals on pure question of law. \u2013 Where the appellant states in his notice of appeal or record on appeal that he will raise only questions of law, no other question shall be allowed, and the evidence need not be elevated.\nA cursory reading of the Petition for Review on Certiorari of Sulpicio Lines would readily reveal that it appealed the Decision dated August 28, 1995 of RTC-Branch 32 in Civil Case Nos. 94-68861, 94-68862, 94-68863, 94-68919, 94-68936, 94-68939, 94-68940, 94-68941, and 94-69028 based only on questions of law.\u00a0 The Petition did not raise any question of fact and did not require the presentation or elevation of evidence.\n\nIn G.R. No. 124855, Dongnama and Kyowa questioned the Resolution dated October 23, 1995, which similarly referred their original Petition for Certiorari, docketed as G.R. No. 122120, to the Court of Appeals, where it was docketed as CA-G.R. SP No. 39188.\u00a0 The Resolution dated October 23, 1995 cited as basis for the referral Section 9, paragraph (1) of Batas Pambansa Blg. 129 which gave the Court of Appeals \u201c[o]riginal jurisdiction to issue writs of mandamus, prohibition, certiorari, habeas corpus, and quo warranto, and auxiliary writs or processes, whether or not in aid of its appellate jurisdiction.\u201d\u00a0 The Court, however, will no longer address the propriety of the referral of the original Petition of Dongnama and Kyowa to the Court of Appeals since said issue has become moot and academic after the appellate court rendered its Decision in CA-G.R. SP No. 39188 on March 29, 1996.\u00a0 The Court will simply treat the Petition in G.R. No. 124855 as an appeal of the Decision dated March 29, 1996 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 39188.\n\nRuling on the merits of the 10 Petitions.\n\nThe Court rules in favor of MAS; Maersk, et al., ; Eastern Shipping; William Lines, et al., ; PSTC; OFSI; Cosco, et al., ; Sulpicio Lines; AISL; and Dongnama and Kyowa.\u00a0 Section 21(B) of the Manila Revenue Code, as amended, was null and void for being beyond the power of the City of Manila and its public officials to enact, approve, and implement under the LGC.\n\nIt is already well-settled that although the power to tax is inherent in the State, the same is not true for the LGUs to whom the power must be delegated by Congress and must be exercised within the guidelines and limitations that Congress may provide.\u00a0 The Court expounded in Pelizloy Realty Corporation v. The Province of Benguet [69] that:\n\nThe power to tax \u201cis an attribute of sovereignty,\u201d and as such, inheres in the State. Such, however, is not true for provinces, cities, municipalities and barangays as they are not the sovereign; rather, they are mere \u201cterritorial and political subdivisions of the Republic of the Philippines\u201d.\n\nThe rule governing the taxing power of provinces, cities, municipalities and barangays is summarized in Icard v. City Council of Baguio :\nIt is settled that a municipal corporation unlike a sovereign state is clothed with no inherent power of taxation. The charter or statute must plainly show an intent to confer that power or the municipality, cannot assume it . And the power when granted is to be construed in strictissimi juris.\u00a0 Any doubt or ambiguity arising out of the term used in granting that power must be resolved against the municipality.\u00a0 Inferences, implications, deductions \u2013 all these \u2013 have no place in the interpretation of the taxing power of a municipal corporation. Therefore, the power of a province to tax is limited to the extent that such power is delegated to it either by the Constitution or by statute. Section 5, Article X of the 1987 Constitution is clear on this point:\nSection 5.\u00a0 Each local government unit shall have the power to create its own sources of revenues and to levy taxes, fees and charges subject to such guidelines and limitations as the Congress may provide, consistent with the basic policy of local autonomy. Such taxes, fees, and charges shall accrue exclusively to the local governments. Per Section 5, Article X of the 1987 Constitution, \u201cthe power to tax is no longer vested exclusively on Congress; local legislative bodies are now given direct authority to levy taxes, fees and other charges.\u201d Nevertheless, such authority is \u201csubject to such guidelines and limitations as the Congress may provide\u201d.\n\nIn conformity with Section 3, Article X of the 1987 Constitution, Congress enacted Republic Act No. 7160, otherwise known as the Local Government Code of 1991. Book II of the LGC governs local taxation and fiscal matters.\n\nRelevant provisions of Book II of the LGC establish the parameters of the taxing powers of LGUs found below.\n\nFirst, Section 130 provides for the following fundamental principles governing the taxing powers of LGUs:\n\nTaxation shall be uniform in each LGU.\n\nTaxes, fees, charges and other impositions shall:\n\nbe equitable and based as far as practicable on the taxpayer\u2019s ability to pay;\n\nbe levied and collected only for public purposes;\n\nnot be unjust, excessive, oppressive, or confiscatory;\n\nnot be contrary to law, public policy, national economic policy, or in the restraint of trade.\n\nThe collection of local taxes, fees, charges and other impositions shall in no case be let to any private person.\n\nThe revenue collected pursuant to the provisions of the LGC shall inure solely to the benefit of, and be subject to the disposition by, the LGU levying the tax, fee, charge or other imposition unless otherwise specifically provided by the LGC.\n\nEach LGU shall, as far as practicable, evolve a progressive system of taxation.\nSecond, Section 133 provides for the common limitations on the taxing powers of LGUs. x x x. (Underscoring and citations omitted.)\nAmong the common limitations on the taxing power of LGUs is Section 133(j) of the LGC, which states that \u201c[u]nless otherwise provided herein,\u201d the taxing power of LGUs shall not extend to \u201c[t]axes on the gross receipts of transportation contractors and persons engaged in the transportation of passengers or freight by hire and common carriers by air, land or water, except as provided in this Code[.]\u201d\n\nSection 133(j) of the LGC clearly and unambiguously proscribes LGUs from imposing any tax on the gross receipts of transportation contractors, persons engaged in the transportation of passengers or freight by hire, and common carriers by air, land, or water.\u00a0 Yet, confusion arose from the phrase \u201cunless otherwise provided herein,\u201d found at the beginning of the said provision.\u00a0 The City of Manila and its public officials insisted that said clause recognized the power of the municipality or city, under Section 143(h) of the LGC, to impose tax \u201con any business subject to the excise, value-added or percentage tax under the National Internal Revenue Code, as amended.\u201d\u00a0 And it was pursuant to Section 143(h) of the LGC that the City of Manila and its public officials enacted, approved, and implemented Section 21(B) of the Manila Revenue Code, as amended.\n\nThe Court is not convinced.\u00a0 Section 133(j) of the LGC prevails over Section 143(h) of the same Code, and Section 21(B) of the Manila Revenue Code, as amended, was manifestly in contravention of the former.\n\nFirst , Section 133(j) of the LGC is a specific provision that explicitly withholds from any LGU, i.e., whether the province, city, municipality, or barangay, the power to tax the gross receipts of transportation contractors, persons engaged in the transportation of passengers or freight by hire, and common carriers by air, land, or water.\n\nIn contrast, Section 143 of the LGC defines the general power of the municipality (as well as the city, if read in relation to Section 151 [70] of the same Code) to tax businesses within its jurisdiction.\u00a0 While paragraphs (a) to (g) thereof identify the particular businesses and fix the imposable tax rates for each, paragraph (h) is apparently the \u201ccatch-all provision\u201d allowing the municipality to impose tax \u201con any business, not otherwise specified in the preceding paragraphs, which the sanggunian concerned may deem proper to tax[.]\u201d\n\nThe succeeding proviso of Section 143(h) of the LGC, viz., \u201cProvided, That on any business subject to the excise, value-added or percentage tax under the National Internal Revenue Code, as amended, the rate of tax shall not exceed two percent (2%) of gross sales or receipts of the preceding calendar year[,]\u201d is not a specific grant of power to the municipality or city to impose business tax on the gross sales or receipts of such a business.\u00a0 Rather, the proviso only fixes a maximum rate of imposable business tax in case the business taxed under Section 143(h) of the LGC happens to be subject to excise, value added, or percentage tax under the NIRC.\n\nThe omnibus grant of power to municipalities and cities under Section 143(h) of the LGC cannot overcome the specific exception/exemption in Section 133(j) of the same Code.\u00a0 This is in accord with the rule on statutory construction that specific provisions must prevail over general ones. [71] A special and specific provision prevails over a general provision irrespective of their relative positions in the statute. Generalia specialibus non derogant. Where there is in the same statute a particular enactment and also a general one which in its most comprehensive sense would include what is embraced in the former, the particular enactment must be operative, and the general enactment must be taken to affect only such cases within its general language as are not within the provisions of the particular enactment. [72]\n\nIn the case at bar, the sanggunian of the municipality or city cannot enact an ordinance imposing business tax on the gross receipts of transportation contractors, persons engaged in the transportation of passengers or freight by hire, and common carriers by air, land, or water, when said sanggunian was already specifically prohibited from doing so.\u00a0 Any exception to the express prohibition under Section 133(j) of the LGC should be just as specific and unambiguous.\n\nSecond, the construction adopted by the Court gives effect to both Sections 133(j) and 143(h) of the LGC.\u00a0 In construing a law, care should be taken that every part thereof be given effect and a construction that could render a provision inoperative should be avoided, and inconsistent provisions should be reconciled whenever possible as parts of a harmonious whole. [73]\n\nAs pointed out by William Lines, et al., , in their Petition, despite the prohibition against LGUs imposing tax on the gross receipts of transportation contractors, persons engaged in the transportation of passengers or freight by hire, and common carriers by air, land, or water, under Section 133(j) of the LGC, there are still other multiple businesses subject to excise, value added, or percentage tax under the NIRC, which the municipalities and cities can still tax pursuant to Section 143(h) of the LGC, such as:\n\n[TABLE_CONTENT]\n1) | Hotels and motels under Sec. 113 of the NIRC;\n2) | Caterers, taxed under Sec. 114 of the NIRC;\n3) | Dealers in securities, taxed under Sec. 116 of the NIRC;\n4) | Franchise holders, taxed under Sec. 117 of the NIRC;\n5) | Senders of overseas dispatch, message or communication originating in the Philippines, taxed under Sec. 118 of the NIRC;\n6) | Banks and non-bank financial intermediaries, taxed under Sec. 119 of the NIRC;\n7) | Finance companies, taxed under Sec. 120 of the NIRC;\n8) | Agents of foreign insurance companies, taxed under Sec. 122 of the NIRC;\n9) | Amusement places, taxed under Sec. 123 of the NIRC;\n10) | Winners in horse races, taxed under Sec. 124 of the NIRC; and\n11) | Those who sell, barter, or exchange shares of stocks, taxed under Sec. 124-A of the NIRC.[74]\n[END_TABLE]\n\n1) Hotels and motels under Sec. 113 of the NIRC; 2) Caterers, taxed under Sec. 114 of the NIRC; 3) Dealers in securities, taxed under Sec. 116 of the NIRC; 4) Franchise holders, taxed under Sec. 117 of the NIRC; 5) Senders of overseas dispatch, message or communication originating in the Philippines, taxed under Sec. 118 of the NIRC; 6) Banks and non-bank financial intermediaries, taxed under Sec. 119 of the NIRC; 7) Finance companies, taxed under Sec. 120 of the NIRC; 8) Agents of foreign insurance companies, taxed under Sec. 122 of the NIRC; 9) Amusement places, taxed under Sec. 123 of the NIRC; 10) Winners in horse races, taxed under Sec. 124 of the NIRC; and 11) Those who sell, barter, or exchange shares of stocks, taxed under Sec. 124-A of the NIRC. [74]\nThus, Section 143(h) of the LGC would not be \u201ca hollow decorative provision with no subject to tax.\u201d\u00a0 On the contrary, it would be Section 133(j) of the LGC which would become inoperative should the Court accept the construction proffered by the City of Manila and its public officials, because then, there would be no instance at all when the gross receipts of the transportation contractors, persons engaged in the transportation of passengers or freight by hire, and common carriers by air, land, or water, would not be subject to tax by the LGUs.\n\nThird , Section 5(b) of the LGC itself, on Rules of Interpretation, provides:\n\nSEC. 5. Rules of Interpretation. \u2013\u00a0 In the interpretation of the provisions of this Code, the following rules shall apply:\n\nx x x x\n\n(b)\u00a0 In case of doubt, any tax ordinance or revenue measure shall be construed strictly against the local government unit enacting it, and liberally in favor of the taxpayer.\u00a0 Any tax exemption, incentive or relief granted by any local government unit pursuant to the provisions of this Code shall be construed strictly against the person claiming it[.]\n\nThe Court strictly construes Section 21(B) of the Manila Revenue Code, as amended, against the City of Manila and its public officials and liberally in favor of the transportation contractors, persons engaged in the transportation of passengers or freight by hire, and common carriers by air, land, or water.\u00a0 Strictly assessed against the guidelines and limitations set forth in the LGC, Section 21(B) of the Manila Revenue Code, as amended, was enacted ultra vires.\n\nAnd fourth, the construction adopted by the Court is in accordance with the consistent intention of the laws to withhold from the LGUs the power to tax transportation contractors, persons engaged in the transportation of passengers or freight by hire, and common carriers by air, land, or water.\n\nEven prior to Section 133(j) of the LGC, Section 5(e) of Presidential Decree No. 231, otherwise known as The Local Tax Code, as amended, already limited the taxing powers of LGUs as follows:\n\nSEC. 5. Common limitations on the taxing powers of local government . \u2013 The exercise of the taxing powers of provinces, cities, municipalities and barrios shall not extend to the imposition of the following:\n\nx x x x\n\n(e)\u00a0 Taxes on the business of transportation contractors and persons engaged in the transportation of passengers or freight by hire and common carries by air, land or water except as otherwise provided in this Code, and taxes or fees for the registration of motor vehicles and for the issuance of all kinds of licenses or permits for the driving thereof;\n\nThe Court, in First Philippine Industrial Corp. v. Court of Appeals , [75] expounded on the lawmakers\u2019 reason for exempting the gross receipts of common carriers from the taxing powers of the LGUs:\n\nFrom the foregoing disquisition, there is no doubt that petitioner is a \u201ccommon carrier\u201d and, therefore, exempt from the business tax as provided for in Section 133 (j), of the Local Government Code x x x\n\nx x x x\n\nThe deliberations conducted in the House of Representatives on the Local Government Code of 1991 are illuminating:\n\u201cMR. AQUINO (A). Thank you, Mr. Speaker.\n\nMr. Speaker, we would like to proceed to page 95, line 1. It states: \u201cSEC. 121 (now Sec. 131). Common Limitations on the Taxing Powers of Local Government Units.\u201d . . .\n\nMR. AQUINO (A.). Thank you Mr. Speaker.\n\nStill on page 95, subparagraph 5, on taxes on the business of transportation. This appears to be one of those being deemed to be exempted from the taxing powers of the local government units. May we know the reason why the transportation business is being excluded from the taxing powers of the local government units?\n\nMR. JAVIER (E.). Mr. Speaker, there is an exception contained in Section 121 (now Sec. 131), line 16, paragraph 5. It states that local government units may not impose taxes on the business of transportation, except as otherwise provided in this code.\n\nNow, Mr. Speaker, if the Gentleman would care to go to page 98 of Book II, one can see there that provinces have the power to impose a tax on business enjoying a franchise at the rate of not more than one-half of 1 percent of the gross annual receipts. So, transportation contractors who are enjoying a franchise would be subject to tax by the province. That is the exception, Mr. Speaker.\n\nWhat we want to guard against here, Mr. Speaker is the imposition of taxes by local government units on the carrier business. Local government units may impose taxes on top of what is already being imposed by the National Internal Revenue Code which is the so-called \u201ccommon carriers tax.\u201d We do not want a duplication of this tax, so we just provided for an exception under Section 125 (now Section 137) that a province may impose this tax at a specific rate.\n\nMR. AQUINO (A.). Thank you for that clarification, Mr. Speaker. . . . It is clear that the legislative intent in excluding from the taxing power of the local government unit the imposition of business tax against common carriers is to prevent a duplication of the so-called \u201ccommon carrier\u2019s tax.\u201d\n\nPetitioner is already paying three (3%) percent common carrier's tax on its gross sales/earnings under the National Internal Revenue Code. To tax petitioner again on its gross receipts in its transportation of petroleum business would defeat the purpose of the Local Government Code. (Citations omitted.)\nConsistent with the foregoing legislative intent, Republic Act No. 7716, more popularly known as the Expanded Value-Added Tax (E-VAT) Law, which took effect after the LGC on May 28, 1994, expressly amended the NIRC of 1977 and added to Section 115 of the latter on \u201cPercentage tax on carriers and keepers of garages,\u201d the following proscription: \u201cThe gross receipts of common carriers derived from their incoming and outgoing freight shall not be subjected to the local taxes imposed under Republic Act No. 7160, otherwise known as the Local Government Code of 1991.\u201d\n\nIV\nDISPOSITIVE PORTION\n\nWHEREFORE , in view of the foregoing, the Court hereby RESOLVES :\n\n1.\u00a0 In G.R.

Peralta, En Banc].In Nacar, this court held:To recapitulate and for future guidance, the guidelines laid down in the case of Eastern Shipping Lines are accordingly modified to embody BSP-MB Circular No. 799, as follows:I. When an obligation, regardless of its source, i.e., law, contracts, quasi-contracts, delicts or quasi-delicts is breached, the contravenor can be held liable for damages. The provisions under Title XVIII on \u201cDamages\u201d of the Civil Code govern in determining the measure of recoverable damages.II. With regard particularly to an award of interest in the concept of actual and compensatory damages, the rate of interest, as well as the accrual thereof, is imposed, as follows: When the obligation is breached, and it consists in the payment of a sum of money, i.e., a loan or forbearance of money, the interest due should be that which may have been stipulated in writing. Furthermore, the interest due shall itself earn legal interest from the time it is judicially demanded. In the absence of stipulation, the rate of interest shall be 6% per annum to be computed from default, i.e., from judicial or extrajudicial demand under and subject to the provisions of Article 1169 of the Civil Code.When an obligation, not constituting a loan or forbearance of money, is breached, an interest on the amount of damages awarded may be imposed at the discretion of the court at the rate of 6% per annum. No interest, however, shall be adjudged on unliquidated claims or damages, except when or until the demand can be established with reasonable certainty. Accordingly, where the demand is established with reasonable certainty, the interest shall begin to run from the time the claim is made judicially or extrajudicially (Art. 1169, Civil Code), but when such certainty cannot be so reasonably established at the time the demand is made, the interest shall begin to run only from the date the judgment of the court is made (at which time the quantification of damages may be deemed to have been reasonably ascertained). The actual base for the computation of legal interest shall, in any case, be on the amount finally adjudged.When the judgment of the court awarding a sum of money becomes final and executory, the rate of legal interest, whether the case falls under paragraph 1 or paragraph 2, above, shall be 6% per annum from such finality until its satisfaction, this interim period being deemed to be by then an equivalent to a forbearance of credit.And, in addition to the above, judgments that have become final and executory prior to July 1, 2013, shall not be disturbed and shall continue to be implemented applying the rate of interest fixed therein.

No. 204944-45, December 03, 2014 ]\n\nFUJI TELEVISION NETWORK, INC., PETITIONER, VS. ARLENE S. ESPIRITU, RESPONDENT.D E C I S I O N\nFUJI TELEVISION NETWORK, INC., PETITIONER, VS. ARLENE S. ESPIRITU, RESPONDENT.\n\nD E C I S I O N\n\nLEONEN, J.:\n\nIt is the burden of the employer to prove that a person whose services it pays for is an independent contractor rather than a regular employee with or without a fixed term. That a person has a disease does not per se entitle the employer to terminate his or her services. Termination is the last resort. At the very least, a competent public health authority must certify that the disease cannot be cured within six (6) months, even with appropriate treatment.\n\nWe decide this petition for review [1] on certiorari filed by Fuji Television Network, Inc., seeking the reversal of the Court of Appeals\u2019 decision [2] dated June 25, 2012, affirming with modification the decision [3] of the National Labor Relations Commission.\n\nIn 2005, Arlene S. Espiritu (\u201cArlene\u201d) was engaged by Fuji Television Network, Inc. (\u201cFuji\u201d) as a news correspondent/producer [4] \u201ctasked to report Philippine news to Fuji through its Manila Bureau field office.\u201d [5] Arlene\u2019s employment contract initially provided for a term of one (1) year but was successively renewed on a yearly basis with salary adjustment upon every renewal. [6]\n\nSometime in January 2009, Arlene was diagnosed with lung cancer. [7] She informed Fuji about her condition. In turn, the Chief of News Agency of Fuji, Yoshiki Aoki, informed Arlene \u201cthat the company will have a problem renewing her contract\u201d [8] since it would be difficult for her to perform her job. [9] She \u201cinsisted that she was still fit to work as certified by her attending physician.\u201d [10]\n\nAfter several verbal and written communications, [11] Arlene and Fuji signed a non-renewal contract on May 5, 2009 where it was stipulated that her contract would no longer be renewed after its expiration on May 31, 2009. The contract also provided that the parties release each other from liabilities and responsibilities under the employment contract. [12]\n\nIn consideration of the non-renewal contract, Arlene \u201cacknowledged receipt of the total amount of US$18,050.00 representing her monthly salary from March 2009 to May 2009, year-end bonus, mid-year bonus, and separation pay.\u201d [13] However, Arlene affixed her signature on the non-renewal contract with the initials \u201cU.P.\u201d for \u201cunder protest.\u201d [14]\n\nOn May 6, 2009, the day after Arlene signed the non-renewal contract, she filed a complaint for illegal dismissal and attorney\u2019s fees with the National Capital Region Arbitration Branch of the National Labor Relations Commission. She alleged that she was forced to sign the non-renewal contract when Fuji came to know of her illness and that Fuji withheld her salaries and other benefits for March and April 2009 when she refused to sign. [15]\n\nArlene claimed that she was left with no other recourse but to sign the non-renewal contract, and it was only upon signing that she was given her salaries and bonuses, in addition to separation pay equivalent to four (4) years. [16]\n\nIn the decision [17] dated September 10, 2009, Labor Arbiter Corazon C. Borbolla dismissed Arlene\u2019s complaint. [18] Citing Sonza v. ABS-CBN [19] and applying the four-fold test, the Labor Arbiter held that Arlene was not Fuji\u2019s employee but an independent contractor. [20]\n\nArlene appealed before the National Labor Relations Commission. In its decision dated March 5, 2010, the National Labor Relations Commission reversed the Labor Arbiter\u2019s decision. [21] It held that Arlene was a regular employee with respect to the activities for which she was employed since she continuously rendered services that were deemed necessary and desirable to Fuji\u2019s business. [22] The National Labor Relations Commission ordered Fuji to pay Arlene backwages, computed from the date of her illegal dismissal. [23] The dispositive portion of the decision reads:\n\nWHEREFORE , premises considered, judgment is hereby rendered GRANTING the instant appeal. The Decision of the Labor Arbiter dated 19 September 2009 is hereby REVERSED and SET ASIDE, and a new one is issued ordering respondents-appellees to pay complainant-appellant backwages computed from the date of her illegal dismissal until finality of this Decision.\n\nSO ORDERED . [24]\n\nArlene and Fuji filed separate motions for reconsideration. [25] Both motions were denied by the National Labor Relations Commission for lack of merit in the resolution dated April 26, 2010. [26]\n\nFrom the decision of the National Labor Relations Commission, both parties filed separate petitions for certiorari [27] before the Court of Appeals. The Court of Appeals consolidated the petitions and considered the following issues for resolution:\n\n1) Whether or not Espiritu is a regular employee or a fixed-term contractual employee;\n\n2) Whether or not Espiritu was illegally dismissed; and\n\n3) Whether or not Espiritu is entitled to damages and attorney\u2019s fees. [28]\nIn the assailed decision, the Court of Appeals affirmed the National Labor Relations Commission with the modification that Fuji immediately reinstate Arlene to her position as News Producer without loss of seniority rights, and pay her backwages, 13th-month pay, mid-year and year-end bonuses, sick leave and vacation leave with pay until reinstated, moral damages, exemplary damages, attorney\u2019s fees, and legal interest of 12% per annum of the total monetary awards. [29]\n\nThe Court of Appeals ruled that:\n\nWHEREFORE , for lack of merit, the petition of Fuji Television Network, Inc. and Yoshiki Aoki is DENIED and the petition of Arlene S. Espiritu is GRANTED. Accordingly, the Decision dated March 5, 2010 of the National Labor Relations Commission, 6th Division in NLRC NCR Case No. 05-06811-09 and its subsequent Resolution dated April 26, 2010 are hereby AFFIRMED with MODIFICATIONS , as follows:\n\nFuji Television, Inc. is hereby ORDERED to immediately REINSTATE Arlene S. Espiritu to her position as News Producer without loss of seniority rights and privileges and to pay her the following:\n\n1. Backwages at the rate of $1,900.00 per month computed from May 5, 2009 (the date of dismissal), until reinstated;\n\n2. 13 th Month Pay at the rate of $1,900.00 per annum from the date of dismissal, until reinstated;\n\n3. One and a half (1\u00bd) months pay or $2,850.00 as midyear bonus per year from the date of dismissal, until reinstated;\n\n4. One and a half (1\u00bd) months pay or $2,850.00 as year-end bonus per year from the date of dismissal, until reinstated;\n\n5. Sick leave of 30 days with pay or $1,900.00 per year from the date of dismissal, until reinstated; and\n\n6. Vacation leave with pay equivalent to 14 days or $1,425.00 per annum from date of dismissal, until reinstated.\n\n7. The amount of P100,000.00 as moral damages;\n\n8. The amount of P50,000.00 as exemplary damages;\n\n9. Attorney\u2019s fees equivalent to 10% of the total monetary awards herein stated; and\n\n10. Legal interest of twelve percent (12%) per annum of the total monetary awards computed from May 5, 2009, until their full satisfaction.\n\nThe Labor Arbiter is hereby DIRECTED to make another re-computation of the above monetary awards consistent with the above directives.\n\nSO ORDERED . [30]\n\nIn arriving at the decision, the Court of Appeals held that Arlene was a regular employee because she was engaged to perform work that was necessary or desirable in the business of Fuji, [31] and the successive renewals of her fixed-term contract resulted in regular employment. [32]\n\nAccording to the Court of Appeals, Sonza does not apply in order to establish that Arlene was an independent contractor because she was not contracted on account of any peculiar ability, special talent, or skill. [33] The fact that everything used by Arlene in her work was owned by Fuji negated the idea of job contracting. [34]\n\nThe Court of Appeals also held that Arlene was illegally dismissed because Fuji failed to comply with the requirements of substantive and procedural due process necessary for her dismissal since she was a regular employee. [35]\n\nThe Court of Appeals found that Arlene did not sign the non-renewal contract voluntarily and that the contract was a mere subterfuge by Fuji to secure its position that it was her choice not to renew her contract. She was left with no choice since Fuji was decided on severing her employment. [36]\n\nFuji filed a motion for reconsideration that was denied in the resolution [37] dated December 7, 2012 for failure to raise new matters. [38]\n\nAggrieved, Fuji filed this petition for review and argued that the Court of Appeals erred in affirming with modification the National Labor Relations Commission\u2019s decision, holding that Arlene was a regular employee and that she was illegally dismissed. Fuji also questioned the award of monetary claims, benefits, and damages. [39]\n\nFuji points out that Arlene was hired as a stringer, and it informed her that she would remain one. [40] She was hired as an independent contractor as defined in Sonza. [41] Fuji had no control over her work. [42] The employment contracts were executed and renewed annually upon Arlene\u2019s insistence to which Fuji relented because she had skills that distinguished her from ordinary employees. [43] Arlene and Fuji dealt on equal terms when they negotiated and entered into the employment contracts. [44] There was no illegal dismissal because she freely agreed not to renew her fixed-term contract as evidenced by her e-mail correspondences with Yoshiki Aoki. [45] In fact, the signing of the non-renewal contract was not necessary to terminate her employment since \u201csuch employment terminated upon expiration of her contract.\u201d [46] Finally, Fuji had dealt with Arlene in good faith, thus, she should not have been awarded damages. [47]\n\nFuji alleges that it did not need a permanent reporter since the news reported by Arlene could easily be secured from other entities or from the internet. [48] Fuji \u201cnever controlled the manner by which she performed her functions.\u201d [49] It was Arlene who insisted that Fuji execute yearly fixed-term contracts so that she could negotiate for annual increases in her pay. [50]\n\nFuji points out that Arlene reported for work for only five (5) days in February 2009, three (3) days in March 2009, and one (1) day in April 2009. [51] Despite the provision in her employment contract that sick leaves in excess of 30 days shall not be paid, Fuji paid Arlene her entire salary for the months of March, April, and May; four (4) months of separation pay; and a bonus for two and a half months for a total of US$18,050.00. [52] Despite having received the amount of US$18,050.00, Arlene still filed a case for illegal dismissal. [53]\n\nFuji further argues that the circumstances would show that Arlene was not illegally dismissed. The decision to not renew her contract was mutually agreed upon by the parties as indicated in Arlene\u2019s e-mail [54] dated March 11, 2009 where she consented to the non-renewal of her contract but refused to sign anything. [55] Aoki informed Arlene in an e-mail [56] dated March 12, 2009 that she did not need to sign a resignation letter and that Fuji would pay Arlene\u2019s salary and bonus until May 2009 as well as separation pay. [57]\n\nArlene sent an e-mail dated March 18, 2009 with her version of the non-renewal agreement that she agreed to sign this time. [58] This attached version contained a provision that Fuji shall re-hire her if she was still interested to work for Fuji. [59] For Fuji, Arlene\u2019s e-mail showed that she had the power to bargain. [60]\n\nFuji then posits that the Court of Appeals erred when it held that the elements of an employer-employee relationship are present, particularly that of control; [61] that Arlene\u2019s separation from employment upon the expiration of her contract constitutes illegal dismissal; [62] that Arlene is entitled to reinstatement; [63] and that Fuji is liable to Arlene for damages and attorney\u2019s fees. [64]\n\nThis petition for review on certiorari under Rule 45 was filed on February 8, 2013. [65] On February 27, 2013, Arlene filed a manifestation [66] stating that this court may not take jurisdiction over the case since Fuji failed to authorize Corazon E. Acerden to sign the verification. [67] Fuji filed a comment on the manifestation [68] on March 9, 2013.\n\nBased on the arguments of the parties, there are procedural and substantive issues for resolution:\n\nWhether the petition for review should be dismissed as Corazon E. Acerden, the signatory of the verification and certification of non-forum shopping of the petition, had no authority to sign the verification and certification on behalf of Fuji;\n\nWhether the Court of Appeals correctly determined that no grave abuse of discretion was committed by the National Labor Relations Commission when it ruled that Arlene was a regular employee, not an independent contractor, and that she was illegally dismissed; and\n\nWhether the Court of Appeals properly modified the National Labor Relations Commission\u2019s decision by awarding reinstatement, damages, and attorney\u2019s fees.\nThe petition should be dismissed.\n\nI\nValidity of the verification and certification against forum shopping\n\nIn its comment on Arlene\u2019s manifestation, Fuji alleges that Corazon was authorized to sign the verification and certification of non-forum shopping because Mr. Shuji Yano was empowered under the secretary\u2019s certificate to delegate his authority to sign the necessary pleadings, including the verification and certification against forum shopping. [69]\n\nOn the other hand, Arlene points out that the authority given to Mr. Shuji Yano and Mr. Jin Eto in the secretary\u2019s certificate is only for the petition for certiorari before the Court of Appeals. [70] Fuji did not attach any board resolution authorizing Corazon or any other person to file a petition for review on certiorari with this court. [71] Shuji Yano and Jin Eto could not re-delegate the power that was delegated to them. [72] In addition, the special power of attorney executed by Shuji Yano in favor of Corazon indicated that she was empowered to sign on behalf of Shuji Yano, and not on behalf of Fuji. [73]\n\nThe Rules of Court requires the\nsubmission of verification and\ncertification against forum shopping\n\nRule 7, Section 4 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure provides the requirement of verification, while Section 5 of the same rule provides the requirement of certification against forum shopping. These sections state:\n\nSEC. 4. Verification . \u2014 Except when otherwise specifically required by law or rule, pleadings need not be under oath, verified or accompanied by affidavit.\n\nA pleading is verified by an affidavit that the affiant has read the pleading and that the allegations therein are true and correct of his knowledge and belief.\n\nA pleading required to be verified which contains a verification based on \u201cinformation and belief,\u201d or upon \u201cknowledge, information and belief,\u201d or lacks a proper verification, shall be treated as an unsigned pleading.\n\nSEC. 5. Certification against forum shopping. \u2014 The plaintiff or principal party shall certify under oath in the complaint or other initiatory pleading asserting a claim for relief or in a sworn certification annexed thereto and simultaneously filed therewith: (a) that he has not theretofore commenced any action or filed any claim involving the same issues in any court, tribunal or quasi-judicial agency and, to the best of his knowledge, no such other action or claim is pending therein; (b) if there is such other pending action or claim, a complete statement of the present status thereof; and (c) if he should thereafter learn that the same or similar action or claim has been filed or is pending, he shall report that fact within five (5) days therefrom to the court wherein his aforesaid complaint or initiatory pleading has been filed.\n\nFailure to comply with the foregoing requirements shall not be curable by mere amendment of the complaint or other initiatory pleading but shall be cause for the dismissal of the case without prejudice, unless otherwise provided, upon motion and after hearing. The submission of a false certification or non-compliance with any of the undertakings therein shall constitute indirect contempt of court, without prejudice to the corresponding administrative and criminal actions. If the acts of the party or his counsel clearly constitute willful and deliberate forum shopping, the same shall be ground for summary dismissal with prejudice and shall constitute direct contempt, as well as a cause for administrative sanctions.\nSection 4(e) of Rule 45 [74] requires that petitions for review should \u201ccontain a sworn certification against forum shopping as provided in the last paragraph of section 2, Rule 42.\u201d Section 5 of the same rule provides that failure to comply with any requirement in Section 4 is sufficient ground to dismiss the petition.\n\nEffects of non-compliance\n\nUy v. Landbank [75] discussed the effect of non-compliance with regard to verification and stated that:\n\n[t]he requirement regarding verification of a pleading is formal, not jurisdictional. Such requirement is simply a condition affecting the form of pleading, the non-compliance of which does not necessarily render the pleading fatally defective. Verification is simply intended to secure an assurance that the allegations in the pleading are true and correct and not the product of the imagination or a matter of speculation, and that the pleading is filed in good faith. The court may order the correction of the pleading if the verification is lacking or act on the pleading although it is not verified, if the attending circumstances are such that strict compliance with the rules may be dispensed with in order that the ends of justice may thereby be served. [76] (Citations omitted)\nShipside Incorporated v. Court of Appeals [77] cited the discussion in Uy and differentiated its effect from non-compliance with the requirement of certification against forum shopping:\n\nOn the other hand, the lack of certification against forum shopping is generally not curable by the submission thereof after the filing of the petition. Section 5, Rule 45 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure provides that the failure of the petitioner to submit the required documents that should accompany the petition, including the certification against forum shopping, shall be sufficient ground for the dismissal thereof. The same rule applies to certifications against forum shopping signed by a person on behalf of a corporation which are unaccompanied by proof that said signatory is authorized to file a petition on behalf of the corporation. [78] (Emphasis supplied)\nEffects of substantial compliance\nwith the requirement of verification\nand certification against forum shopping\n\nAlthough the general rule is that failure to attach a verification and certification against forum shopping is a ground for dismissal, there are cases where this court allowed substantial compliance.\n\nIn Loyola v. Court of Appeals , [79] petitioner Alan Loyola submitted the required certification one day after filing his electoral protest. [80] This court considered the subsequent filing as substantial compliance since the purpose of filing the certification is to curtail forum shopping. [81]\n\nIn LDP Marketing, Inc. v. Monter, [82] Ma. Lourdes Dela Pe\u00f1a signed the verification and certification against forum shopping but failed to attach the board resolution indicating her authority to sign. [83] In a motion for reconsideration, LDP Marketing attached the secretary\u2019s certificate quoting the board resolution that authorized Dela Pe\u00f1a. [84] Citing Shipside, this court deemed the belated submission as substantial compliance since LDP Marketing complied with the requirement; what it failed to do was to attach proof of Dela Pe\u00f1a\u2019s authority to sign. [85]\n\nHavtor Management Phils., Inc. v. National Labor Relations Commission [86] and General Milling Corporation v. National Labor Relations Commission [87] involved petitions that were dismissed for failure to attach any document showing that the signatory on the verification and certification against forum-shopping was authorized. [88] In both cases, the secretary\u2019s certificate was attached to the motion for reconsideration. [89] This court considered the subsequent submission of proof indicating authority to sign as substantial compliance. [90]\n\nAltres v. Empleo [91] summarized the rules on verification and certification against forum shopping in this manner:\n\nFor the guidance of the bench and bar, the Court restates in capsule form the jurisprudential pronouncements . . . respecting non-compliance with the requirement on, or submission of defective, verification and certification against forum shopping:\n\n[TABLE_CONTENT]\n1) | A distinction must be made between non-compliance with the requirement on or submission of defective verification, and non-compliance with the requirement on or submission of defective certification against forum shopping.\n2) | As to verification, non-compliance therewith or a defect therein does not necessarily render the pleading fatally defective. The court may order its submission or correction or act on the pleading if the attending circumstances are such that strict compliance with the Rule may be dispensed with in order that the ends of justice may be served thereby.\n3) | Verification is deemed substantially complied with when one who has ample knowledge to swear to the truth of the allegations in the complaint or petition signs the verifcation, and when matters alleged in the petition have been made in good faith or are true and correct.\n4) | As to certification against forum shopping, non-compliance therewith or a defect therein, unlike in verification, is generally not curable by its subsequent submission or correction thereof, unless there is a need to relax the Rule on the ground of \u201csubstantial compliance\u201d or presence of \u201cspecial circumstances or compelling reasons.\u201d\n5) | The certification against forum shopping must be signed by all the plaintiffs or petitioners in a case; otherwise, those who did not sign will be dropped as parties to the case. Under reasonable or justifiable circumstances, however, as when all the plaintiffs or petitioners share a common interest and invoke a common cause of action or defense, the signature of only one of them in the certification against forum shopping substantially complies with the Rule.\n6) | Finally, the certification against forum shopping must be executed by the party-pleader, not by his counsel. If, however, for reasonable or justifiable reasons, the party-pleader is unable to sign, he must execute a Special Power of Attorney designating his counsel of record to sign on his behalf.[92]\n[END_TABLE]\n\n1) A distinction must be made between non-compliance with the requirement on or submission of defective verification, and non-compliance with the requirement on or submission of defective certification against forum shopping. 2) As to verification, non-compliance therewith or a defect therein does not necessarily render the pleading fatally defective. The court may order its submission or correction or act on the pleading if the attending circumstances are such that strict compliance with the Rule may be dispensed with in order that the ends of justice may be served thereby. 3) Verification is deemed substantially complied with when one who has ample knowledge to swear to the truth of the allegations in the complaint or petition signs the verifcation, and when matters alleged in the petition have been made in good faith or are true and correct. 4) As to certification against forum shopping, non-compliance therewith or a defect therein, unlike in verification, is generally not curable by its subsequent submission or correction thereof, unless there is a need to relax the Rule on the ground of \u201csubstantial compliance\u201d or presence of \u201cspecial circumstances or compelling reasons.\u201d 5) The certification against forum shopping must be signed by all the plaintiffs or petitioners in a case; otherwise, those who did not sign will be dropped as parties to the case. Under reasonable or justifiable circumstances, however, as when all the plaintiffs or petitioners share a common interest and invoke a common cause of action or defense, the signature of only one of them in the certification against forum shopping substantially complies with the Rule. 6) Finally, the certification against forum shopping must be executed by the party-pleader, not by his counsel. If, however, for reasonable or justifiable reasons, the party-pleader is unable to sign, he must execute a Special Power of Attorney designating his counsel of record to sign on his behalf. [92]\nThere was substantial compliance\nby Fuji Television Network, Inc.\n\nBeing a corporation, Fuji exercises its power to sue and be sued through its board of directors or duly authorized officers and agents. Thus, the physical act of signing the verification and certification against forum shopping can only be done by natural persons duly authorized either by the corporate by-laws or a board resolution. [93]\n\nIn its petition for review on certiorari, Fuji attached Hideaki Ota\u2019s secretary\u2019s certificate, [94] authorizing Shuji Yano and Jin Eto to represent and sign for and on behalf of Fuji. [95] The secretary\u2019s certificate was duly authenticated [96] by Sulpicio Confiado, Consul-General of the Philippines in Japan. Likewise attached to the petition is the special power of attorney executed by Shuji Yano, authorizing Corazon to sign on his behalf. [97] The verification and certification against forum shopping was signed by Corazon. [98]\n\nArlene filed the manifestation dated February 27, 2013, arguing that the petition for review should be dismissed because Corazon was not duly authorized to sign the verification and certification against forum shopping.\n\nFuji filed a comment on Arlene\u2019s manifestation, stating that Corazon was properly authorized to sign. On the basis of the secretary\u2019s certificate, Shuji Yano was empowered to delegate his authority.\n\nQuoting the board resolution dated May 13, 2010, the secretary's certificate states:\n\n(a) The Corporation shall file a Petition for Certiorari with the Court of Appeals, against Philippines\u2019 National Labor Relations Commission (\u201cNLRC\u201d) and Arlene S. Espiritu, pertaining to NLRC-NCR Case No. LAC 00-002697-09, RAB No. 05-06811-00 and entitled \u201cArlene S. Espiritu v. Fuji Television Network, Inc./Yoshiki Aoki\u201d , and participate in any other subsequent proceeding that may necessarily arise therefrom, including but not limited to the filing of appeals in the appropriate venue;\n\n(b) Mr. Shuji Yano and Mr. Jin Eto be authorized, as they are hereby authorized, to verify and execute the certification against non-forum shopping which may be necessary or required to be attached to any pleading to [sic] submitted to the Court of Appeals; and the authority to so verify and certify for the Corporation in favor of the said persons shall subsist and remain effective until the termination of the said case;\n\n. . . .\n\n(d) Mr. Shuji Yano and Mr. Jin Eto be authorized, as they are hereby authorized, to represent and appear on behalf the [sic] Corporation in all stages of the [sic] this case and in any other proceeding that may necessarily arise thereform [sic], and to act in the Corporation\u2019s name, place and stead to determine, propose, agree, decide, do, and perform any and all of the following:\nThe possibility of amicable settlement or of submission to alternative mode of dispute resolution;\nThe simplification of the issue;\nThe necessity or desirability of amendments to the pleadings;\nThe possibility of obtaining stipulation or admission of facts and documents; and\nSuch other matters as may aid in the prompt disposition of the action. [99] (Emphasis in the original; Italics omitted)\nShuji Yano executed a special power of attorney appointing Ms. Ma. Corazon E. Acerden and Mr. Moises A. Rollera as his attorneys-in-fact. [100] The special power of attorney states:\n\nThat I, SHUJI YANO , of legal age, Japanese national, with office address at 2-4-8 Daiba, Minato-Ku, Tokyo, 137-8088 Japan, and being the representative of Fuji TV, INc., [sic] (evidenced by the attached Secretary\u2019s Certificate) one of the respondents in NLRC-NCR Case No. 05-06811-00 entitled \u201c Arlene S. Espiritu v. Fuji Television Network, Inc./Yoshiki Aoki\u201d, and subsequently docketed before the Court of Appeals as C.A. G.R. S.P. No. 114867 ( Consolidated with SP No. 114889 ) do hereby make, constitute and appoint Ms. Ma. Corazon E. Acerden and Mr. Moises A. Rollera as my true and lawful attorneys-in-fact for me and my name, place and stead to act and represent me in the above-mentioned case, with special power to make admission/s and stipulations and/or to make and submit as well as to accept and approve compromise proposals upon such terms and conditions and under such covenants as my attorney-in-fact may deem fit, and to engage the services of Villa Judan and Cruz Law Offices as the legal counsel to represent the Company in the Supreme Court;\n\nThe said Attorneys-in-Fact are hereby further authorized to make, sign, execute and deliver such papers or documents as may be necessary in furtherance of the power thus granted, particularly to sign and execute the verification and certification of non-forum shopping needed to be filed. [101] (Emphasis in the original)\nIn its comment [102] on Arlene\u2019s manifestation, Fuji argues that Shuji Yano could further delegate his authority because the board resolution empowered him to \u201cact in the Corporation\u2019s name, place and stead to determine, propose, agree, decided [sic], do and perform any and all of the following: . . . such other matters as may aid in the prompt disposition of the action. \u201d [103]\n\nTo clarify, Fuji attached a verification and certification against forum shopping, but Arlene questions Corazon\u2019s authority to sign. Arlene argues that the secretary\u2019s certificate empowered Shuji Yano to file a petition for certiorari before the Court of Appeals, and not a petition for review before this court, and that since Shuji Yano\u2019s authority was delegated to him, he could not further delegate such power. Moreover, Corazon was representing Shuji Yano in his personal capacity, and not in his capacity as representative of Fuji.\n\nA review of the board resolution quoted in the secretary\u2019s certificate shows that Fuji shall \u201c file a Petition for Certiorari with the Court of Appeals \u201d [104] and \u201cparticipate in any other subsequent proceeding that may necessarily arise therefrom, including but not limited to the filing of appeals in the appropriate venue, \u201d [105] and that Shuji Yano and Jin Eto are authorized to represent Fuji \u201c in any other proceeding that may necessarily arise thereform [sic].\u201d [106] As pointed out by Fuji, Shuji Yano and Jin Eto were also authorized to \u201cact in the Corporation\u2019s name, place and stead to determine, propose, agree, decide, do, and perform any and all of the following: . . . 5. Such other matters as may aid in the prompt disposition of the action. \u201d [107]\n\nConsidering that the subsequent proceeding that may arise from the petition for certiorari with the Court of Appeals is the filing of a petition for review with this court, Fuji substantially complied with the procedural requirement.\n\nOn the issue of whether Shuji Yano validly delegated his authority to Corazon, Article 1892 of the Civil Code of the Philippines states:\n\nART. 1892. The agent may appoint a substitute if the principal has not prohibited him from doing so; but he shall be responsible for the acts of the substitute:\n\n(1) When he was not given the power to appoint one;\n\n(2) When he was given such power, but without designating the person, and the person appointed was notoriously incompetent or insolvent.\n\nAll acts of the substitute appointed against the prohibition of the principal shall be void.\nThe secretary\u2019s certificate does not state that Shuji Yano is prohibited from appointing a substitute. In fact, he is empowered to do acts that will aid in the resolution of this case.\n\nThis court has recognized that there are instances when officials or employees of a corporation can sign the verification and certification against forum shopping without a board resolution. In Cagayan Valley Drug Corporation v. CIR , [108] it was held that:\n\nIn sum, we have held that the following officials or employees of the company can sign the verification and certification without need of a board resolution: (1) the Chairperson of the Board of Directors, (2) the President of a corporation, (3) the General Manager or Acting General Manager, (4) Personnel Officer, and (5) an Employment Specialist in a labor case.\n\nWhile the above cases [109] do not provide a complete listing of authorized signatories to the verification and certification required by the rules, the determination of the sufficiency of the authority was done on a case to case basis. The rationale applied in the foregoing cases is to justify the authority of corporate officers or representatives of the corporation to sign the verification or certificate against forum shopping, being \u2018in a position to verify the truthfulness and correctness of the allegations in the petition.\u2019 [110]\nCorazon\u2019s affidavit [111] states that she is the \u201c office manager and resident interpreter of the Manila Bureau of Fuji Television Network, Inc. \u201d [112] and that she has \u201cheld the position for the last twenty-three years.\u201d [113]\n\nAs the office manager for 23 years, Corazon can be considered as having knowledge of all matters in Fuji\u2019s Manila Bureau Office and is in a position to verify \u201cthe truthfulness and the correctness of the allegations in the Petition.\u201d [114]\n\nThus, Fuji substantially complied with the requirements of verification and certification against forum shopping.\n\nBefore resolving the substantive issues in this case, this court will discuss the procedural parameters of a Rule 45 petition for review in labor cases.\n\nII\nProcedural parameters of petitions for review in labor cases\nArticle 223 of the Labor Code [115] does not provide any mode of appeal for decisions of the National Labor Relations Commission. It merely states that \u201c[t]he decision of the Commission shall be final and executory after ten (10) calendar days from receipt thereof by the parties.\u201d Being final, it is no longer appealable. However, the finality of the National Labor Relations Commission\u2019s decisions does not mean that there is no more recourse for the parties.\n\nIn St. Martin Funeral Home v. National Labor Relations Commission, [116] this court cited several cases [117] and rejected the notion that this court had no jurisdiction to review decisions of the National Labor Relations Commission. It stated that this court had the power to review the acts of the National Labor Relations Commission to see if it kept within its jurisdiction in deciding cases and also as a form of check and balance. [118] This court then clarified that judicial review of National Labor Relations Commission decisions shall be by way of a petition for certiorari under Rule 65. Citing the doctrine of hierarchy of courts, it further ruled that such petitions shall be filed before the Court of Appeals. From the Court of Appeals, an aggrieved party may file a petition for review on certiorari under Rule 45.\n\nA petition for certiorari under Rule 65 is an original action where the issue is limited to grave abuse of discretion. As an original action, it cannot be considered as a continuation of the proceedings of the labor tribunals.\n\nOn the other hand, a petition for review on certiorari under Rule 45 is a mode of appeal where the issue is limited to questions of law. In labor cases, a Rule 45 petition is limited to reviewing whether the Court of Appeals correctly determined the presence or absence of grave abuse of discretion and deciding other jurisdictional errors of the National Labor Relations Commission. [119]\n\nIn Odango v. National Labor Relations Commission , [120] this court explained that a petition for certiorari is an extraordinary remedy that is \u201cavailable only and restrictively in truly exceptional cases\u201d [121] and that its sole office \u201cis the correction of errors of jurisdiction including commission of grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction.\u201d [122] A petition for certiorari does not include a review of findings of fact since the findings of the National Labor Relations Commission are accorded finality. [123] In cases where the aggrieved party assails the National Labor Relations Commission\u2019s findings, he or she must be able to show that the Commission \u201cacted capriciously and whimsically or in total disregard of evidence material to the controversy.\u201d [124]\n\nWhen a decision of the Court of Appeals under a Rule 65 petition is brought to this court by way of a petition for review under Rule 45, only questions of law may be decided upon. As held in Meralco Industrial v. National Labor Relations Commission : [125]\n\nThis Court is not a trier of facts. Well-settled is the rule that the jurisdiction of this Court in a petition for review on certiorari under Rule 45 of the Revised Rules of Court is limited to reviewing only errors of law, not of fact, unless the factual findings complained of are completely devoid of support from the evidence on record, or the assailed judgment is based on a gross misapprehension of facts. Besides, factual findings of quasi-judicial agencies like the NLRC, when affirmed by the Court of Appeals, are conclusive upon the parties and binding on this Court. [126]\nCareer Philippines v. Serna , [127] citing Montoya v. Transmed, [128] is instructive on the parameters of judicial review under Rule 45:\n\nAs a rule, only questions of law may be raised in a Rule 45 petition. In one case, we discussed the particular parameters of a Rule 45 appeal from the CA\u2019s Rule 65 decision on a labor case, as follows:\nIn a Rule 45 review, we consider the correctness of the assailed CA decision, in contrast with the review for jurisdictional error that we undertake under Rule 65. Furthermore, Rule 45 limits us to the review of questions of law raised against the assailed CA decision. In ruling for legal correctness, we have to view the CA decision in the same context that the petition for certiorari it ruled upon was presented to it; we have to examine the CA decision from the prism of whether it correctly determined the presence or absence of grave abuse of discretion in the NLRC decision before it, not on the basis of whether the NLRC decision on the merits of the case was correct. In other words, we have to be keenly aware that the CA undertook a Rule 65 review, not a review on appeal, of the NLRC decision challenged before it. [129] (Emphasis in the original)\nJustice Brion\u2019s dissenting opinion in Abott Laboratories, PhiIippines v. AIcaraz [130] discussed that in petitions for review under Rule 45, \u201c the Court simply determines whether the legal correctness of the CA\u2019s finding that the NLRC ruling . . . had basis in fact and in Iaw.\u201d [131] In this kind of petition, the proper question to be raised is, \u201c Did the CA correctly determine whether the NLRC committed grave abuse of discretion in ruling on the case?\u201d [132]\n\nJustice Brion\u2019s dissenting opinion also laid down the following guidelines:\n\nIf the NLRC ruling has basis in the evidence and the applicable law and jurisprudence, then no grave abuse of discretion exists and the CA should so declare and, accordingly, dismiss the petition. If grave abuse of discretion exists, then the CA must grant the petition and nullify the NLRC ruling, entering at the same time the ruling that is justified under the evidence and the governing law, rules and jurisprudence. In our Rule 45 review, this Court must deny the petition if it finds that the CA correctly acted. [133] (Emphasis in the original)\nThese parameters shall be used in resolving the substantive issues in this petition.\n\nIII\nDetermination of employment status; burden of proof\nIn this case, there is no question that Arlene rendered services to Fuji. However, Fuji alleges that Arlene was an independent contractor, while Arlene alleges that she was a regular employee. To resolve this issue, we ascertain whether an employer-employee relationship existed between Fuji and Arlene.\n\nThis court has often used the four-fold test to determine the existence of an employer-employee relationship. Under the four-fold test, the \u201ccontrol test\u201d is the most important. [134] As to how the elements in the four-fold test are proven, this court has discussed that:\n\n[t]here is no hard and fast rule designed to establish the aforesaid elements. Any competent and relevant evidence to prove the relationship may be admitted. Identification cards, cash vouchers, social security registration, appointment letters or employment contracts, payrolls, organization charts, and personnel lists, serve as evidence of employee status. [135]\n\nIf the facts of this case vis-\u00e0-vis the four-fold test show that an employer-employee relationship existed, we then determine the status of Arlene\u2019s employment, i.e., whether she was a regular employee. Relative to this, we shall analyze Arlene\u2019s fixed-term contract and determine whether it supports her argument that she was a regular employee, or the argument of Fuji that she was an independent contractor. We shall scrutinize whether the nature of Arlene\u2019s work was necessary and desirable to Fuji\u2019s business or whether Fuji only needed the output of her work. If the circumstances show that Arlene\u2019s work was necessary and desirable to Fuji, then she is presumed to be a regular employee. The burden of proving that she was an independent contractor lies with Fuji.\n\nIn labor cases, the quantum of proof required is substantial evidence. [136] \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d has been defined as \u201csuch amount of relevant evidence which a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to justify a conclusion.\u201d [137]\n\nIf Arlene was a regular employee, we then determine whether she was illegally dismissed. In complaints for illegal dismissal, the burden of proof is on the employee to prove the fact of dismissal. [138] Once the employee establishes the fact of dismissal, supported by substantial evidence, the burden of proof shifts to the employer to show that there was a just or authorized cause for the dismissal and that due process was observed. [139]\n\nIV\nWhether the Court of Appeals correctly affirmed the National Labor Relations Commission\u2019s finding that Arlene was a regular employee\nFuji alleges that Arlene was an independent contractor, citing Sonza v. ABS-CBN and relying on the following facts: (1) she was hired because of her skills; (2) her salary was US$1,900.00, which is higher than the normal rate; (3) she had the power to bargain with her employer; and (4) her contract was for a fixed term. According to Fuji, the Court of Appeals erred when it ruled that Arlene was forced to sign the non-renewal agreement, considering that she sent an email with another version of the non-renewal agreement. [140] Further, she is not entitled to moral damages and attorney\u2019s fees because she acted in bad faith when she filed a labor complaint against Fuji after receiving US$18,050.00 representing her salary and other benefits. [141]\n\nArlene argues that she was a regular employee because Fuji had control and supervision over her work. The news events that she covered were all based on the instructions of Fuji. [142] She maintains that the successive renewal of her employment contracts for four (4) years indicates that her work was necessary and desirable. [143] In addition, Fuji\u2019s payment of separation pay equivalent to one (1) month\u2019s pay per year of service indicates that she was a regular employee. [144] To further support her argument that she was not an independent contractor, she states that Fuji owns the laptop computer and mini-camera that she used for work. [145]\n\nArlene also argues that Sonza is not applicable because she was a plain reporter for Fuji, unlike Jay Sonza who was a news anchor, talk show host, and who enjoyed a celebrity status. [146]\n\nOn her illness, Arlene points out that it was not a ground for her dismissal because her attending physician certified that she was fit to work. [147]\n\nArlene admits that she signed the non-renewal agreement with quitclaim, not because she agreed to its terms, but because she was not in a position to reject the non-renewal agreement. Further, she badly needed the salary withheld for her sustenance and medication. [148] She posits that her acceptance of separation pay does not bar filing of a complaint for illegal dismissal. [149]\n\nArticle 280 of the Labor Code provides that:\n\nArt. 280. Regular and casual employment. The provisions of written agreement to the contrary notwithstanding and regardless of the oral agreement of the parties, an employment shall be deemed to be regular where the employee has been engaged to perform activities which are usually necessary or desirable in the usual business or trade of the employer, except where the employment has been fixed for a specific project or undertaking the completion or termination of which has been determined at the time of the engagement of the employee or where the work or services to be performed is seasonal in nature and the employment is for the duration of the season.\n\nAn employment shall be deemed to be casual if it is not covered by the preceding paragraph; Provided, That, any employee who has rendered at least one year of service, whether such service is continuous or broken, shall be considered a regular employee with respect to the activity in which he is employed and his employment shall continue while such activity exist.\n\nThis provision classifies employees into regular, project, seasonal, and casual. It further classifies regular employees into two kinds: (1) those \u201cengaged to perform activities which are usually necessary or desirable in the usual business or trade of the employer\u201d; and (2) casual employees who have \u201crendered at least one year of service, whether such service is continuous or broken.\u201d\n\nAnother classification of employees, i.e. , employees with fixed-term contracts, was recognized in Brent School, Inc. v. Zamora [150] where this court discussed that:\n\nLogically, the decisive determinant in the term employment should not be the activities that the employee is called upon to perform, but the day certain agreed upon by the parties for the commencement and termination of their employment relationship, a day certain being understood to be \u201cthat which must necessarily come, although it may not be known when.\u201d [151] (Emphasis in the original)\nThis court further discussed that there are employment contracts where \u201ca fixed term is an essential and natural appurtenance\u201d [152] such as overseas employment contracts and officers in educational institutions. [153]\n\nDistinctions among fixed-term\nemployees, independent contractors,\nand regular employees\n\nGMA Network, Inc. v. Pabriga [154] expounded the doctrine on fixed-term contracts laid down in Brent in the following manner:\n\nCognizant of the possibility of abuse in the utilization of fixed-term employment contracts, we emphasized in Brent that where from the circumstances it is apparent that the periods have been imposed to preclude acquisition of tenurial security by the employee, they should be struck down as contrary to public policy or morals. We thus laid down indications or criteria under which \u201cterm employment\u201d cannot be said to be in circumvention of the law on security of tenure, namely:\n\n1) The fixed period of employment was knowingly and voluntarily agreed upon by the parties without any force, duress, or improper pressure being brought to bear upon the employee and absent any other circumstances vitiating his consent; or\n\n2) It satisfactorily appears that the employer and the employee dealt with each other on more or less equal terms with no moral dominance exercised by the former or the latter. These indications, which must be read together, make the Brent doctrine applicable only in a few special cases wherein the employer and employee are on more or less in equal footing in entering into the contract. The reason for this is evident: when a prospective employee, on account of special skills or market forces, is in a position to make demands upon the prospective employer, such prospective employee needs less protection than the ordinary worker. Lesser limitations on the parties\u2019 freedom of contract are thus required for the protection of the employee. [155] (Citations omitted)\nFor as long as the guidelines laid down in Brent are satisfied, this court will recognize the validity of the fixed-term contract.\n\nIn Labayog v. M.Y. San Biscuits, Inc. , [156] this court upheld the fixed-term employment of petitioners because from the time they were hired, they were informed that their engagement was for a specific period. This court stated that:\n\n[s]imply put, petitioners were not regular employees. While their employment as mixers, packers and machine operators was necessary and desirable in the usual business of respondent company, they were employed temporarily only, during periods when there was heightened demand for production. Consequently, there could have been no illegal dismissal when their services were terminated on expiration of their contracts. There was even no need for notice of termination because they knew exactly when their contracts would end. Contracts of employment for a fixed period terminate on their own at the end of such period.\n\nContracts of employment for a fixed period are not unlawful. What is objectionable is the practice of some scrupulous employers who try to circumvent the law protecting workers from the capricious termination of employment. [157] (Citation omitted)\nCaparoso v. Court of Appeals [158] upheld the validity of the fixed-term contract of employment. Caparoso and Quindipan were hired as delivery men for three (3) months. At the end of the third month, they were hired on a monthly basis. In total, they were hired for five (5) months. They filed a complaint for illegal dismissal. [159] This court ruled that there was no evidence indicating that they were pressured into signing the fixed-term contracts. There was likewise no proof that their employer was engaged in hiring workers for five (5) months only to prevent regularization. In the absence of these facts, the fixed-term contracts were upheld as valid. [160]\n\nOn the other hand, an independent contractor is defined as:\n\n. . . one who carries on a distinct and independent business and undertakes to perform the job, work, or service on its own account and under one\u2019s own responsibility according to one\u2019s own manner and method, free from the control and direction of the principal in all matters connected with the performance of the work except as to the results thereof. [161]\nIn view of the \u201cdistinct and independent business\u201d of independent contractors, no employer-employee relationship exists between independent contractors and their principals.\n\nIndependent contractors are recognized under Article 106 of the Labor Code:\n\nArt. 106. Contractor or subcontractor. Whenever an employer enters into a contract with another person for the performance of the former\u2019s work, the employees of the contractor and of the latter\u2019s subcontractor, if any, shall be paid in accordance with the provisions of this Code.\n\n. . . .\n\nThe Secretary of Labor and Employment may, by appropriate regulations, restrict or prohibit the contracting-out of labor to protect the rights of workers established under this Code. In so prohibiting or restricting, he may make appropriate distinctions between labor-only contracting and job contracting as well as differentiations within these types of contracting and determine who among the parties involved shall be considered the employer for purposes of this Code, to prevent any violation or circumvention of any provision of this Code.\n\nThere is \u201clabor-only\u201d contracting where the person supplying workers to an employer does not have substantial capital or investment in the form of tools, equipment, machineries, work premises, among others, and the workers recruited and placed by such person are performing activities which are directly related to the principal business of such employer. In such cases, the person or intermediary shall be considered merely as an agent of the employer who shall be responsible to the workers in the same manner and extent as if the latter were directly employed by him.\nIn Department Order No. 18-A, Series of 2011, of the Department of Labor and Employment, a contractor is defined as having:\n\nSection 3. . . .\n\n. . . .\n\n(c) . . . an arrangement whereby a principal agrees to put out or farm out with a contractor the performance or completion of a specific job, work or service within a definite or predetermined period, regardless of whether such job, work or service is to be performed or completed within or outside the premises of the principal.\nThis department order also states that there is a trilateral relationship in legitimate job contracting and subcontracting arrangements among the principal, contractor, and employees of the contractor. There is no employer-employee relationship between the contractor and principal who engages the contractor\u2019s services, but there is an employer-employee relationship between the contractor and workers hired to accomplish the work for the principal. [162]\n\nJurisprudence has recognized another kind of independent contractor: individuals with unique skills and talents that set them apart from ordinary employees. There is no trilateral relationship in this case because the independent contractor himself or herself performs the work for the principal. In other words, the relationship is bilateral.\n\nIn Orozco v. Court of Appeals , [163] Wilhelmina Orozco was a columnist for the Philippine Daily Inquirer. This court ruled that she was an independent contractor because of her \u201ctalent, skill, experience, and her unique viewpoint as a feminist advocate.\u201d [164] In addition, the Philippine Daily Inquirer did not have the power of control over Orozco, and she worked at her own pleasure. [165]\n\nSemblante v. Court of Appeals [166] involved a masiador [167] and a sentenciador . [168] This court ruled that \u201cpetitioners performed their functions as masiador and sentenciador free from the direction and control of respondents\u201d [169] and that the masiador and sentenciador \u201crelied mainly on their \u2018expertise that is characteristic of the cockfight gambling.\u2019\u201d [170] Hence, no employer-employee relationship existed.\n\nBernarte v. Philippine Basketball Association [171] involved a basketball referee. This court ruled that \u201ca referee is an independent contractor, whose special skills and independent judgment are required specifically for such position and cannot possibly be controlled by the hiring party.\u201d [172]\n\nIn these cases, the workers were found to be independent contractors because of their unique skills and talents and the lack of control over the means and methods in the performance of their work.\n\nIn other words, there are different kinds of independent contractors: those engaged in legitimate job contracting and those who have unique skills and talents that set them apart from ordinary employees.\n\nSince no employer-employee relationship exists between independent contractors and their principals, their contracts are governed by the Civil Code provisions on contracts and other applicable laws. [173]\n\nA contract is defined as \u201ca meeting of minds between two persons whereby one binds himself, with respect to the other, to give something or to render some service.\u201d [174] Parties are free to stipulate on terms and conditions in contracts as long as these \u201care not contrary to law, morals, good customs, public order, or public policy.\u201d [175] This presupposes that the parties to a contract are on equal footing. They can bargain on terms and conditions until they are able to reach an agreement.\n\nOn the other hand, contracts of employment are different and have a higher level of regulation because they are impressed with public interest. Article XIII, Section 3 of the 1987 Constitution provides full protection to labor:\n\nArticle XIII. Social Justice and Human Rights\n. . . .\n\nLabor\n\nSection 3. The State shall afford full protection to labor, local and overseas, organized and unorganized, and promote full employment and equality of employment opportunities for all.\n\nIt shall guarantee the rights of all workers to self-organization, collective bargaining and negotiations, and peaceful concerted activities, including the right to strike in accordance with law. They shall be entitled to security of tenure, humane conditions of work, and a living wage. They shall also participate in policy and decision-making processes affecting their rights and benefits as may be provided by law.\n\nThe State shall promote the principle of shared responsibility between workers and employers and the preferential use of voluntary modes in settling disputes, including conciliation, and shall enforce their mutual compliance therewith to foster industrial peace.\n\nThe State shall regulate the relations between workers and employers, recognizing the right of labor to its just share in the fruits of production and the right of enterprises to reasonable returns on investments, and to expansion and growth.\nApart from the constitutional guarantee of protection to labor, Article 1700 of the Civil Code states:\n\nART. 1700. The relations between capital and labor are not merely contractual. They are so impressed with public interest that labor contracts must yield to the common good. Therefore, such contracts are subject to the special laws on labor unions, collective bargaining, strikes and lockouts, closed shop, wages, working conditions, hours of labor and similar subjects.\nIn contracts of employment, the employer and the employee are not on equal footing. Thus, it is subject to regulatory review by the labor tribunals and courts of law. The law serves to equalize the unequal. The labor force is a special class that is constitutionally protected because of the inequality between capital and labor. [176] This presupposes that the labor force is weak.\n\nHowever, the level of protection to labor should vary from case to case; otherwise, the state might appear to be too paternalistic in affording protection to labor. As stated in GMA Network, Inc. v. Pabriga, the ruling in Brent applies in cases where it appears that the employer and employee are on equal footing. [177] This recognizes the fact that not all workers are weak. To reiterate the discussion in GMA Network v. Pabriga :\n\nThe reason for this is evident: when a prospective employee, on account of special skills or market forces, is in a position to make demands upon the prospective employer, such prospective employee needs less protection than the ordinary worker. Lesser limitations on the parties\u2019 freedom of contract are thus required for the protection of the employee. [178]\nThe level of protection to labor must be determined on the basis of the nature of the work, qualifications of the employee, and other relevant circumstances.\n\nFor example, a prospective employee with a bachelor\u2019s degree cannot be said to be on equal footing with a grocery bagger with a high school diploma. Employees who qualify for jobs requiring special qualifications such as \u201c[having] a Master\u2019s degree\u201d or \u201c[having] passed the licensure exam\u201d are different from employees who qualify for jobs that require \u201c[being a] high school graduate; with pleasing personality.\u201d In these situations, it is clear that those with special qualifications can bargain with the employer on equal footing. Thus, the level of protection afforded to these employees should be different.\n\nFuji\u2019s argument that Arlene was an independent contractor under a fixed-term contract is contradictory. Employees under fixed-term contracts cannot be independent contractors because in fixed-term contracts, an employer-employee relationship exists. The test in this kind of contract is not the necessity and desirability of the employee\u2019s activities, \u201cbut the day certain agreed upon by the parties for the commencement and termination of the employment relationship.\u201d [179] For regular employees, the necessity and desirability of their work in the usual course of the employer\u2019s business are the determining factors. On the other hand, independent contractors do not have employer-employee relationships with their principals.\n\nHence, before the status of employment can be determined, the existence of an employer-employee relationship must be established.\n\nThe four-fold test [180] can be used in determining whether an employer-employee relationship exists. The elements of the four-fold test are the following: (1) the selection and engagement of the employee; (2) the payment of wages; (3) the power of dismissal; and (4) the power of control, which is the most important element. [181]\n\nThe \u201cpower of control\u201d was explained by this court in Corporal, Sr. v. National Labor Relations Commission : [182]\n\nThe power to control refers to the existence of the power and not necessarily to the actual exercise thereof, nor is it essential for the employer to actually supervise the performance of duties of the employee. It is enough that the employer has the right to wield that power. [183] (Citation omitted)\nOrozco v. Court of Appeals further elucidated the meaning of \u201cpower of control\u201d and stated the following:\n\nLogically, the line should be drawn between rules that merely serve as guidelines towards the achievement of the mutually desired result without dictating the means or methods to be employed in attaining it, and those that control or fix the methodology and bind or restrict the party hired to the use of such means. The first, which aim only to promote the result, create no employer-employee relationship unlike the second, which address both the result and the means used to achieve it. . . . [184] (Citation omitted)\n\nIn Locsin, et al. v. Philippine Long Distance Telephone Company, [185] the \u201cpower of control\u201d was defined as \u201c [the] right to control not only the end to be achieved but also the means to be used in reaching such end .\u201d [186]\n\nHere, the Court of Appeals applied Sonza v. ABS-CBN and Dumpit-Murillo v. Court of Appeals [187] in determining whether Arlene was an independent contractor or a regular employee.\n\nIn deciding Sonza and Dumpit-Murillo, this court used the four-fold test. Both cases involved newscasters and anchors. However, Sonza was held to be an independent contractor, while Dumpit-Murillo was held to be a regular employee.\n\nComparison of the Sonza and\nDumpit-Murillo cases using\nthe four-fold test\n\nSonza was engaged by ABS-CBN in view of his \u201cunique skills, talent and celebrity status not possessed by ordinary employees.\u201d [188] His work was for radio and television programs. [189] On the other hand, Dumpit-Murillo was hired by ABC as a newscaster and co-anchor. [190]\n\nSonza\u2019s talent fee amounted to P317,000.00 per month, which this court found to be a substantial amount that indicated he was an independent contractor rather than a regular employee. [191] Meanwhile, Dumpit-Murillo\u2019s monthly salary was P28,000.00, a very low amount compared to what Sonza received. [192]\n\nSonza was unable to prove that ABS-CBN could terminate his services apart from breach of contract. There was no indication that he could be terminated based on just or authorized causes under the Labor Code. In addition, ABS-CBN continued to pay his talent fee under their agreement, even though his programs were no longer broadcasted. [193] Dumpit-Murillo was found to have been illegally dismissed by her employer when they did not renew her contract on her fourth year with ABC. [194]\n\nIn Sonza, this court ruled that ABS-CBN did not control how Sonza delivered his lines, how he appeared on television, or how he sounded on radio. [195] All that Sonza needed was his talent. [196] Further, \u201cABS-CBN could not terminate or discipline SONZA even if the means and methods of performance of his work . . . did not meet ABS-CBN\u2019s approval.\u201d [197] In Dumpit-Murillo, the duties and responsibilities enumerated in her contract was a clear indication that ABC had control over her work. [198]\n\nApplication of the four-fold test\n\nThe Court of Appeals did not err when it relied on the ruling in Dumpit-Murillo and affirmed the ruling of the National Labor Relations Commission finding that Arlene was a regular employee. Arlene was hired by Fuji as a news producer, but there was no showing that she was hired because of unique skills that would distinguish her from ordinary employees. Neither was there any showing that she had a celebrity status. Her monthly salary amounting to US$1,900.00 appears to be a substantial sum, especially if compared to her salary when she was still connected with GMA. [199] Indeed, wages may indicate whether one is an independent contractor. Wages may also indicate that an employee is able to bargain with the employer for better pay. However, wages should not be the conclusive factor in determining whether one is an employee or an independent contractor.\n\nFuji had the power to dismiss Arlene, as provided for in paragraph 5 of her professional employment contract. [200] Her contract also indicated that Fuji had control over her work because she was required to work for eight (8) hours from Monday to Friday, although on flexible time. [201] Sonza was not required to work for eight (8) hours, while Dumpit-Murillo had to be in ABC to do both on-air and off-air tasks.\n\nOn the power to control, Arlene alleged that Fuji gave her instructions on what to report. [202] Even the mode of transportation in carrying out her functions was controlled by Fuji. Paragraph 6 of her contract states:\n\nDuring the travel to carry out work, if there is change of place or change of place of work, the train, bus, or public transport shall be used for the trip. If the Employee uses the private car during the work and there is an accident the Employer shall not be responsible for the damage, which may be caused to the Employee. [203]\nThus, the Court of Appeals did not err when it upheld the findings of the National Labor Relations Commission that Arlene was not an independent contractor.\n\nHaving established that an employer-employee relationship existed between Fuji and Arlene, the next questions for resolution are the following: Did the Court of Appeals correctly affirm the National Labor Relations Commission that Arlene had become a regular employee? Was the nature of Arlene\u2019s work necessary and desirable for Fuji\u2019s usual course of business?\n\nArlene was a regular employee\nwith a fixed-term contract\n\nThe test for determining regular employment is whether there is a reasonable connection between the employee\u2019s activities and the usual business of the employer. Article 280 provides that the nature of work must be \u201cnecessary or desirable in the usual business or trade of the employer\u201d as the test for determining regular employment. As stated in ABS-CBN Broadcasting Corporation v. Nazareno : [204]\n\nIn determining whether an employment should be considered regular or non-regular, the applicable test is the reasonable connection between the particular activity performed by the employee in relation to the usual business or trade of the employer. The standard, supplied by the law itself, is whether the work undertaken is necessary or desirable in the usual business or trade of the employer, a fact that can be assessed by looking into the nature of the services rendered and its relation to the general scheme under which the business or trade is pursued in the usual course. It is distinguished from a specific undertaking that is divorced from the normal activities required in carrying on the particular business or trade. [205]\nHowever, there may be a situation where an employee\u2019s work is necessary but is not always desirable in the usual course of business of the employer. In this situation, there is no regular employment.\n\nIn San Miguel Corporation v. National Labor Relations Commission , [206] Francisco de Guzman was hired to repair furnaces at San Miguel Corporation\u2019s Manila glass plant. He had a separate contract for every furnace that he repaired. He filed a complaint for illegal dismissal three (3) years after the end of his last contract. [207] In ruling that de Guzman did not attain the status of a regular employee, this court explained:\n\nNote that the plant where private respondent was employed for only seven months is engaged in the manufacture of glass, an integral component of the packaging and manufacturing business of petitioner. The process of manufacturing glass requires a furnace, which has a limited operating life. Petitioner resorted to hiring project or fixed term employees in having said furnaces repaired since said activity is not regularly performed. Said furnaces are to be repaired or overhauled only in case of need and after being used continuously for a varying period of five (5) to ten (10) years.\n\nIn 1990, one of the furnaces of petitioner required repair and upgrading. This was an undertaking distinct and separate from petitioner's business of manufacturing glass. For this purpose, petitioner must hire workers to undertake the said repair and upgrading. . . .\n\n. . . .\n\nClearly, private respondent was hired for a specific project that was not within the regular business of the corporation. For petitioner is not engaged in the business of repairing furnaces. Although the activity was necessary to enable petitioner to continue manufacturing glass, the necessity therefor arose only when a particular furnace reached the end of its life or operating cycle. Or, as in the second undertaking, when a particular furnace required an emergency repair. In other words, the undertakings where private respondent was hired primarily as helper/bricklayer have specified goals and purposes which are fulfilled once the designated work was completed. Moreover, such undertakings were also identifiably separate and distinct from the usual, ordinary or regular business operations of petitioner, which is glass manufacturing. These undertakings, the duration and scope of which had been determined and made known to private respondent at the time of his employment, clearly indicated the nature of his employment as a project employee. [208]\nFuji is engaged in the business of broadcasting, [209] including news programming. [210] It is based in Japan [211] and has overseas offices to cover international news. [212]\n\nBased on the record, Fuji\u2019s Manila Bureau Office is a small unit [213] and has a few employees. [214] As such, Arlene had to do all activities related to news gathering. Although Fuji insists that Arlene was a stringer, it alleges that her designation was \u201cNews Talent/Reporter/Producer.\u201d [215]\n\nA news producer \u201cplans and supervises newscast . . . [and] work[s] with reporters in the field planning and gathering information. . . .\u201d [216] Arlene\u2019s tasks included \u201c[m]onitoring and [g]etting [n]ews [s]tories, [r]eporting interviewing subjects in front of a video camera,\u201d [217] \u201cthe timely submission of news and current events reports pertaining to the Philippines[,] and traveling [sic] to [Fuji\u2019s] regional office in Thailand.\u201d [218] She also had to report for work in Fuji\u2019s office in Manila from Mondays to Fridays, eight (8) hours per day. [219] She had no equipment and had to use the facilities of Fuji to accomplish her tasks.\n\nThe Court of Appeals affirmed the finding of the National Labor Relations Commission that the successive renewals of Arlene\u2019s contract indicated the necessity and desirability of her work in the usual course of Fuji\u2019s business. Because of this, Arlene had become a regular employee with the right to security of tenure. [220] The Court of Appeals ruled that:\n\nHere, Espiritu was engaged by Fuji as a stinger [sic] or news producer for its Manila Bureau. She was hired for the primary purpose of news gathering and reporting to the television network\u2019s headquarters. Espiritu was not contracted on account of any peculiar ability or special talent and skill that she may possess which the network desires to make use of. Parenthetically, if it were true that Espiritu is an independent contractor, as claimed by Fuji, the fact that everything that she uses to perform her job is owned by the company including the laptop computer and mini camera discounts the idea of job contracting. [221]\nMoreover, the Court of Appeals explained that Fuji\u2019s argument that no employer-employee relationship existed in view of the fixed-term contract does not persuade because fixed-term contracts of employment are strictly construed. [222] Further, the pieces of equipment Arlene used were all owned by Fuji, showing that she was a regular employee and not an independent contractor. [223]\n\nThe Court of Appeals likewise cited Dumpit-Murillo , which involved fixed-term contracts that were successively renewed for four (4) years. [224] This court held that \u201c[t]his repeated engagement under contract of hire is indicative of the necessity and desirability of the petitioner\u2019s work in private respondent ABC\u2019s business.\u201d [225]\n\nWith regard to Fuji\u2019s argument that Arlene\u2019s contract was for a fixed term, the Court of Appeals cited Philips Semiconductors, Inc. v. Fadriquela [226] and held that where an employee\u2019s contract \u201chad been continuously extended or renewed to the same position, with the same duties and remained in the employ without any interruption,\u201d [227] then such employee is a regular employee. The continuous renewal is a scheme to prevent regularization. On this basis, the Court of Appeals ruled in favor of Arlene.\n\nAs stated in Price, et al. v. Innodata Corp., et al. : [228]\n\nThe employment status of a person is defined and prescribed by law and not by what the parties say it should be. Equally important to consider is that a contract of employment is impressed with public interest such that labor contracts must yield to the common good. Thus, provisions of applicable statutes are deemed written into the contract, and the parties are not at liberty to insulate themselves and their relationships from the impact of labor laws and regulations by simply contracting with each other. [229] (Citations omitted)\nArlene\u2019s contract indicating a fixed term did not automatically mean that she could never be a regular employee. This is precisely what Article 280 seeks to avoid. The ruling in Brent remains as the exception rather than the general rule.\n\nFurther, an employee can be a regular employee with a fixed-term contract. The law does not preclude the possibility that a regular employee may opt to have a fixed-term contract for valid reasons. This was recognized in Brent : For as long as it was the employee who requested, or bargained, that the contract have a \u201cdefinite date of termination,\u201d or that the fixed-term contract be freely entered into by the employer and the employee, then the validity of the fixed-term contract will be upheld. [230]\n\nV\nWhether the Court of Appeals correctly affirmed\nthe National Labor Relations Commission\u2019s finding of illegal dismissal\nFuji argues that the Court of Appeals erred when it held that Arlene was illegally dismissed, in view of the non-renewal contract voluntarily executed by the parties. Fuji also argues that Arlene\u2019s contract merely expired; hence, she was not illegally dismissed. [231]\n\nArlene alleges that she had no choice but to sign the non-renewal contract because Fuji withheld her salary and benefits.\n\nWith regard to this issue, the Court of Appeals held:\n\nWe cannot subscribe to Fuji\u2019s assertion that Espiritu\u2019s contract merely expired and that she voluntarily agreed not to renew the same. Even a cursory perusal of the subject Non-Renewal Contract readily shows that the same was signed by Espiritu under protest. What is apparent is that the Non-Renewal Contract was crafted merely as a subterfuge to secure Fuji\u2019s position that it was Espiritu\u2019s choice not to renew her contract. [232]\nAs a regular employee, Arlene was entitled to security of tenure and could be dismissed only for just or authorized causes and after the observance of due process.\n\nThe right to security of tenure is guaranteed under Article XIII, Section 3 of the 1987 Constitution:\n\nArticle XIII. Social Justice and Human Rights\n\n. . . .\n\nLabor\n\n. . . .\n\nIt shall guarantee the rights of all workers to self-organization, collective bargaining and negotiations, and peaceful concerted activities, including the right to strike in accordance with law. They shall be entitled to security of tenure , humane conditions of work, and a living wage. They shall also participate in policy and decision-making processes affecting their rights and benefits as may be provided by law.\n\nArticle 279 of the Labor Code also provides for the right to security of tenure and states the following:\n\nArt. 279. Security of tenure . In cases of regular employment, the employer shall not terminate the services of an employee except for a just cause of when authorized by this Title. An employee who is unjustly dismissed from work shall be entitled to reinstatement without loss of seniority rights and other privileges and to his full backwages, inclusive of allowances, and to his other benefits or their monetary equivalent computed from the time his compensation was withheld from him up to the time of his actual reinstatement.\nThus, on the right to security of tenure, no employee shall be dismissed, unless there are just or authorized causes and only after compliance with procedural and substantive due process is conducted.\n\nEven probationary employees are entitled to the right to security of tenure. This was explained in Philippine Daily Inquirer, Inc. v. Magtibay, Jr .: [233]\n\nWithin the limited legal six-month probationary period, probationary employees are still entitled to security of tenure. It is expressly provided in the afore-quoted Article 281 that a probationary employee may be terminated only on two grounds: (a) for just cause, or (b) when he fails to qualify as a regular employee in accordance with reasonable standards made known by the employer to the employee at the time of his engagement. [234] (Citation omitted)\nThe expiration of Arlene\u2019s contract does not negate the finding of illegal dismissal by Fuji. The manner by which Fuji informed Arlene that her contract would no longer be renewed is tantamount to constructive dismissal. To make matters worse, Arlene was asked to sign a letter of resignation prepared by Fuji. [235] The existence of a fixed-term contract should not mean that there can be no illegal dismissal. Due process must still be observed in the pre-termination of fixed-term contracts of employment.\n\nIn addition, the Court of Appeals and the National Labor Relations Commission found that Arlene was dismissed because of her health condition. In the non-renewal agreement executed by Fuji and Arlene, it is stated that:\n\nWHEREAS, the SECOND PARTY is undergoing chemotherapy which prevents her from continuing to effectively perform her functions under the said Contract such as the timely submission of news and current events reports pertaining to the Philippines and travelling [sic] to the FIRST PARTY\u2019s regional office in Thailand. [236] (Emphasis supplied)\nDisease as a ground for termination is recognized under Article 284 of the Labor Code:\n\nArt. 284. Disease as ground for termination. An employer may terminate the services of an employee who has been found to be suffering from any disease and whose continued employment is prohibited by law or is prejudicial to his health as well as to the health of his co-employees: Provided, That he is paid separation pay equivalent to at least one (1) month salary or to one-half (1/2) month salary for every year of service, whichever is greater, a fraction of at least six (6) months being considered as one (1) whole year.\nBook VI, Rule 1, Section 8 of the Omnibus Rules Implementing the Labor Code provides:\n\nSec. 8. Disease as a ground for dismissal . \u2013 Where the employee suffers from a disease and his continued employment is prohibited by law or prejudicial to his health or to the health of his co-employees, the employer shall not terminate his employment unless there is a certification by a competent public health authority that the disease is of such nature or at such a stage that it cannot be cured within a period of six (6) months even with proper medical treatment. If the disease or ailment can be cured within the period, the employer shall not terminate the employee but shall ask the employee to take a leave. The employer shall reinstate such employee to his former position immediately upon the restoration of his normal health.\nFor dismissal under Article 284 to be valid, two requirements must be complied with: (1) the employee\u2019s disease cannot be cured within six (6) months and his \u201ccontinued employment is prohibited by law or prejudicial to his health as well as to the health of his co-employees\u201d; and (2) certification issued by a competent public health authority that even with proper medical treatment, the disease cannot be cured within six (6) months. [237] The burden of proving compliance with these requisites is on the employer. [238] Non-compliance leads to the conclusion that the dismissal was illegal. [239]\n\nThere is no evidence showing that Arlene was accorded due process. After informing her employer of her lung cancer, she was not given the chance to present medical certificates. Fuji immediately concluded that Arlene could no longer perform her duties because of chemotherapy. It did not ask her how her condition would affect her work. Neither did it suggest for her to take a leave, even though she was entitled to sick leaves. Worse, it did not present any certificate from a competent public health authority. What Fuji did was to inform her that her contract would no longer be renewed, and when she did not agree, her salary was withheld. Thus, the Court of Appeals correctly upheld the finding of the National Labor Relations Commission that for failure of Fuji to comply with due process, Arlene was illegally dismissed. [240]\n\nVI\nWhether the Court of Appeals properly modified\nthe National Labor Relations Commission\u2019s decision\nwhen it awarded reinstatement, damages, and attorney\u2019s fees\nThe National Labor Relations Commission awarded separation pay in lieu of reinstatement, on the ground that the filing of the complaint for illegal dismissal may have seriously strained relations between the parties. Backwages were also awarded, to be computed from date of dismissal until the finality of the National Labor Relations Commission\u2019s decision. However, only backwages were included in the dispositive portion because the National Labor Relations Commission recognized that Arlene had received separation pay in the amount of US$7,600.00.\n\nThe Court of Appeals affirmed the National Labor Relations Commission\u2019s decision but modified it by awarding moral and exemplary damages and attorney\u2019s fees, and all other benefits Arlene was entitled to under her contract with Fuji. The Court of Appeals also ordered reinstatement, reasoning that the grounds when separation pay was awarded in lieu of reinstatement were not proven. [241]\n\nArticle 279 of the Labor Code provides:\n\nArt. 279. Security of tenure. In cases of regular employment, the employer shall not terminate the services of an employee except for a just cause or when authorized by this Title. An employee who is unjustly dismissed from work shall be entitled to reinstatement without loss of seniority rights and other privileges and to his full backwages, inclusive of allowances, and to his other benefits or their monetary equivalent computed from the time his compensation was withheld from him up to the time of his actual reinstatement. (Emphasis supplied)\nThe Court of Appeals\u2019 modification of the National Labor Relations Commission\u2019s decision was proper because the law itself provides that illegally dismissed employees are entitled to reinstatement, backwages including allowances, and all other benefits.\n\nOn reinstatement, the National Labor Relations Commission ordered payment of separation pay in lieu of reinstatement, reasoning \u201cthat the filing of the instant suit may have seriously abraded the relationship of the parties so as to render reinstatement impractical.\u201d [242] The Court of Appeals reversed this and ordered reinstatement on the ground that separation pay in lieu of reinstatement is allowed only in several instances such as (1) when the employer has ceased operations; (2) when the employee\u2019s position is no longer available; (3) strained relations; and (4) a substantial period has lapsed from date of filing to date of finality. [243]\n\nOn this matter, Quijano v. Mercury Drug Corp . [244] is instructive:\n\nWell-entrenched is the rule that an illegally dismissed employee is entitled to reinstatement as a matter of right. . . .\n\nTo protect labor\u2019s security of tenure, we emphasize that the doctrine of \u201cstrained relations\u201d should be strictly applied so as not to deprive an illegally dismissed employee of his right to reinstatement. Every labor dispute almost always results in \u201cstrained relations\u201d and the phrase cannot be given an overarching interpretation, otherwise, an unjustly dismissed employee can never be reinstated. [245] (Citations omitted)\n\nThe Court of Appeals reasoned that strained relations are a question of fact that must be supported by evidence. [246] No evidence was presented by Fuji to prove that reinstatement was no longer feasible. Fuji did not allege that it ceased operations or that Arlene\u2019s position was no longer available. Nothing in the records shows that Arlene\u2019s reinstatement would cause an atmosphere of antagonism in the workplace. Arlene filed her complaint in 2009. Five (5) years are not yet a substantial period [247] to bar reinstatement.\n\nOn the award of damages, Fuji argues that Arlene is not entitled to the award of damages and attorney\u2019s fees because the non-renewal agreement contained a quitclaim, which Arlene signed.\n\nQuitclaims in labor cases do not bar illegally dismissed employees from filing labor complaints and money claim. As explained by Arlene, she signed the non-renewal agreement out of necessity. In Land and Housing Development Corporation v. Esquillo, [248] this court explained:\n\nWe have heretofore explained that the reason why quitclaims are commonly frowned upon as contrary to public policy, and why they are held to be ineffective to bar claims for the full measure of the workers\u2019 legal rights, is the fact that the employer and the employee obviously do not stand on the same footing. The employer drove the employee to the wall. The latter must have to get hold of money. Because, out of a job, he had to face the harsh necessities of life. He thus found himself in no position to resist money proffered. His, then, is a case of adherence, not of choice. [249]\nWith regard to the Court of Appeals\u2019 award of moral and exemplary damages and attorney\u2019s fees, this court has recognized in several cases that moral damages are awarded \u201cwhen the dismissal is attended by bad faith or fraud or constitutes an act oppressive to labor, or is done in a manner contrary to good morals, good customs or public policy.\u201d [250] On the other hand, exemplary damages may be awarded when the dismissal was effected \u201cin a wanton, oppressive or malevolent manner.\u201d [251]\n\nThe Court of Appeals and National Labor Relations Commission found that after Arlene had informed Fuji of her cancer, she was informed that there would be problems in renewing her contract on account of her condition. This information caused Arlene mental anguish, serious anxiety, and wounded feelings that can be gleaned from the tenor of her email dated March 11, 2009. A portion of her email reads:\n\nI WAS SO SURPRISED . . . that at a time when I am at my lowest, being sick and very weak, you suddenly came to deliver to me the NEWS that you will no longer renew my contract. I knew this will come but I never thought that you will be so \u2018heartless\u2019 and insensitive to deliver that news just a month after I informed you that I am sick. I was asking for patience and understanding and your response was not to RENEW my contract. [252]\nApart from Arlene\u2019s illegal dismissal, the manner of her dismissal was effected in an oppressive approach with her salary and other benefits being withheld until May 5, 2009, when she had no other choice but to sign the non-renewal contract. Thus, there was legal basis for the Court of Appeals to modify the National Labor Relations Commission\u2019s decision.\n\nHowever, Arlene received her salary for May 2009. [253] Considering that the date of her illegal dismissal was May 5, 2009, [254] this amount may be subtracted from the total monetary award.\n\nWith regard to the award of attorney\u2019s fees, Article 111 of the Labor Code states that \u201c[i]n cases of unlawful withholding of wages, the culpable party may be assessed attorney\u2019s fees equivalent to ten percent of the amount of wages recovered.\u201d Likewise, this court has recognized that \u201cin actions for recovery of wages or where an employee was forced to litigate and, thus, incur expenses to protect his rights and interest, the award of attorney\u2019s fees is legally and morally justifiable.\u201d [255] Due to her illegal dismissal, Arlene was forced to litigate.\n\nIn the dispositive portion of its decision, the Court of Appeals awarded legal interest at the rate of 12% per annum. [256] In view of this court\u2019s ruling in Nacar v. Gallery Frames, [257] the legal interest shall be reducd to a rate of 6% per annum from July 1, 2013 until full satisfaction.\n\nWHEREFORE , the petition is DENIED. The assailed Court of Appeals decision dated June 25, 2012 is AFFIRMED with the modification that backwages shall be computed from June 2009. Legal interest shall be computed at the rate of 6% per annum of the total monetary awards from May 5, 2009 until full satisfaction.\n\nSO ORDERED.\n\nCarpio, (Chairperson), Del Castillo, Mendoza, and Villarama, Jr., * JJ ., concur.\n\n* Designated Acting Member per Special Order No. 1888 dated November 28, 2014.\n\n[1] Rollo , pp. 16\u201397.\n\n[2] Id. at 111\u2013126.

Peralta, En Banc].\nIn Nacar, this court held:\n\nTo recapitulate and for future guidance, the guidelines laid down in the case of Eastern Shipping Lines are accordingly modified to embody BSP-MB Circular No. 799, as follows:\n\nI. When an obligation, regardless of its source, i.e., law, contracts, quasi-contracts, delicts or quasi-delicts is breached, the contravenor can be held liable for damages. The provisions under Title XVIII on \u201cDamages\u201d of the Civil Code govern in determining the measure of recoverable damages.\nII. With regard particularly to an award of interest in the concept of actual and compensatory damages, the rate of interest, as well as the accrual thereof, is imposed, as follows:\n\nWhen the obligation is breached, and it consists in the payment of a sum of money, i.e., a loan or forbearance of money, the interest due should be that which may have been stipulated in writing. Furthermore, the interest due shall itself earn legal interest from the time it is judicially demanded. In the absence of stipulation, the rate of interest shall be 6% per annum to be computed from default, i.e. , from judicial or extrajudicial demand under and subject to the provisions of Article 1169 of the Civil Code.\n\nWhen an obligation, not constituting a loan or forbearance of money, is breached, an interest on the amount of damages awarded may be imposed at the discretion of the court at the rate of 6% per annum. No interest, however, shall be adjudged on unliquidated claims or damages, except when or until the demand can be established with reasonable certainty. Accordingly, where the demand is established with reasonable certainty, the interest shall begin to run from the time the claim is made judicially or extrajudicially (Art. 1169, Civil Code), but when such certainty cannot be so reasonably established at the time the demand is made, the interest shall begin to run only from the date the judgment of the court is made (at which time the quantification of damages may be deemed to have been reasonably ascertained). The actual base for the computation of legal interest shall, in any case, be on the amount finally adjudged.\n\nWhen the judgment of the court awarding a sum of money becomes final and executory, the rate of legal interest, whether the case falls under paragraph 1 or paragraph 2, above, shall be 6% per annum from such finality until its satisfaction, this interim period being deemed to be by then an equivalent to a forbearance of credit. And, in addition to the above, judgments that have become final and executory prior to July 1, 2013, shall not be disturbed and shall continue to be implemented applying the rate of interest fixed therein.\nSource: Supreme Court E-Library\nThis page was dynamically generated\nby the E-Library Content Management System (E-LibCMS)",

      "title": "PHILIPPINE ELECTRIC CORPORATION (PHILEC), PETITIONER, VS. COURT OF APPEALS, NATIONAL CONCILIATION AND MEDIATION BOARD (NCMB), DEPARTMENT OF LABOR AND EMPLOYMENT, RAMON T. JIMENEZ, IN HIS CAPACITY AS VOLUNTARY ARBITRATOR, PHILEC WORKERS\u2019 UNION (PWU), ELEODORO V. LIPIO, AND EMERLITO C. IGNACIO, RESPONDENTS.D E C I S I O N LEONEN, J.: An appeal to reverse or modify a Voluntary Arbitrator\u2019s award or decision must be filed before the Court of Appeals within 10 calendar days from receipt of the award or decision.This is a petition[1] for review on certiorari of the Court of Appeals\u2019 decision[2] dated May 25, 2004, dismissing the Philippine Electric Corporation\u2019s petition for certiorari for lack of merit.Philippine Electric Corporation (PHILEC) is a domestic corporation \u201cengaged in the manufacture and repairs of high voltage transformers.\u201d[3] Among its rank-and-file employees were Eleodoro V. Lipio (Lipio) and Emerlito C. Ignacio, Sr. (Ignacio, Sr.), former members of the PHILEC Workers\u2019 Union (PWU).[4] PWU is a legitimate labor organization and the exclusive bargaining representative of PHILEC\u2019s rank-and-file employees.[5]From June 1, 1989 to May 31, 1997, PHILEC and its rank-and-file employees were governed by collective bargaining agreements providing for the following step increases in an employee\u2019s basic salary in case of promotion:[6] Pay Grade Rank-and-File (PWU) June 1, 1989 to May 31, 1992 June 1, 1992 to May 31, 1994 June 1, 1994 to May 31, 1997 I \u2013 II 50 60 65 II \u2013 III 60 70 78 III \u2013 IV 70 80 95 IV \u2013 V 80 110 120 V- VI 100 140 150 VI \u2013 VII 120 170 195 VII \u2013 VIII 170 230 255 VIII \u2013 IX 220 290 340 IX \u2013 X 260 350 455 On August 18, 1997 and with the previous collective bargaining agreements already expired, PHILEC selected Lipio for promotion from Machinist under Pay Grade VIII[7] to Foreman I under Pay Grade B.[8] PHILEC served Lipio a memorandum,[9] instructing him to undergo training for the position of Foreman I beginning on August 25, 1997. PHILEC undertook to pay Lipio training allowance as provided in the memorandum:This will confirm your selection and that you will undergo training for the position of Foreman I (PG B) of the Tank Finishing Section, Distribution Transformer Manufacturing and Repair effective August 25, 1997.You will be trained as a Foreman I, and shall receive the following training allowance until you have completed the training/observation period which shall not exceed four (4) months. First Month - - - - - P350.00 Second Month - - - - - P815.00 Third Month - - - - - P815.00 Fourth Month - - - - - P815.00 Please be guided accordingly.[10]Ignacio, Sr., then DT-Assembler with Pay Grade VII,[11] was likewise selected for training for the position of Foreman I.[12] On August 21, 1997, PHILEC served Ignacio, Sr. a memorandum,[13] instructing him to undergo training with the following schedule of allowance:This will confirm your selection and that you will undergo training for the position of Foreman I (PG B) of the Assembly Section, Distribution Transformer Manufacturing and Repair effective August 25, 1997.You will be trained as a Foreman I, and shall receive the following training allowance until you have completed the training/observation period which shall not exceed four (4) months. First Month - - - - - P255.00 Second Month - - - - - P605.00 Third Month - - - - - P1,070.00 Fourth Month - - - - - P1,070.00 Please be guided accordingly.[14]On September 17, 1997, PHILEC and PWU entered into a new collective bargaining agreement, effective retroactively on June 1, 1997 and expiring on May 31, 1999.[15] Under Article X, Section 4 of the June 1, 1997 collective bargaining agreement, a rank-and-file employee promoted shall be entitled to the following step increases in his or her basic salary:[16]Section 4. STEP INCREASES. [Philippine Electric Corporation] shall adopt the following step increases on the basic salary in case of promotion effective June 1, 1997. Such increases shall be based on the scale below or upon the minimum of the new pay grade to which the employee is promoted, whichever is higher: Pay Grade Step Increase I - II P80.00 II - III P105.00 III - IV P136.00 IV - V P175.00 V - VI P224.00 VI - VII P285.00 VII - VIII P361.00 VIII - IX P456.00 IX - X P575.00 To be promoted, a rank-and-file employee shall undergo training or observation and shall receive training allowance as provided in Article IX, Section 1(f) of the June 1, 1997 collective bargaining agreement:[17]Section 1. JOB POSTING AND BIDDING:. . . .(f) Allowance for employees under Training or Observation shall be on a graduated basis as follows:For the first month of training, the allowance should be equivalent to one step increase of the next higher grade. Every month thereafter the corresponding increase shall be equivalent to the next higher grade until the allowance for the grade applied for is attained.As an example, if a Grade I employee qualifies for a Grade III position, he will receive the training allowance for Grade I to Grade II for the first month. On the second month, he will receive the training allowance for Grade I to Grade II plus the allowance for Grade II to Grade III. He will then continue to receive this amount until he finishes his training or observation period.[18]Claiming that the schedule of training allowance stated in the memoranda served on Lipio and Ignacio, Sr. did not conform to Article X, Section 4 of the June 1, 1997 collective bargaining agreement, PWU submitted the grievance to the grievance machinery.[19]PWU and PHILEC failed to amicably settle their grievance. Thus, on December 21, 1998, the parties filed a submission agreement[20] with the National Conciliation and Mediation Board, submitting the following issues to voluntary arbitration:IWHETHER OR NOT PHILEC VIOLATED SECTION 4 (Step Increases) ARTICLE X (Wage and Position Standardization) OF THE EXISTING COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENT (CBA) IN IMPLEMENTING THE STEP INCREASES RELATIVE TO THE PROMOTION OF INDIVIDUAL COMPLAINANTS.IIWHETHER OR NOT PHILEC\u2019s MANNER OF IMPLEMENTING THE STEP INCREASES IN CONNECTION WITH THE PROMOTION OF INDIVIDUAL COMPLAINANTS IN RELATION TO THE PROVISIONS OF SECTION 4, ARTICLE X OF THE CBA CONSTITUTES UNFAIR LABOR PRACTICE.[21]In their submission agreement, PWU and PHILEC designated Hon. Ramon T. Jimenez as Voluntary Arbitrator (Voluntary Arbitrator Jimenez).[22]Voluntary Arbitrator Jimenez, in the order[23] dated January 4, 1999, directed the parties to file their respective position papers.In its position paper,[24] PWU maintained that PHILEC failed to follow the schedule of step increases under Article X, Section 4 of the June 1, 1997 collective bargaining agreement. Machinist I, Lipio\u2019s position before he underwent training for Foreman I, fell under Pay Grade VIII, while Foreman I fell under Pay Grade X. Following the schedule under Article X, Section 4 of the June 1, 1997 collective bargaining agreement and the formula under Article IX, Section 1(f), Lipio should be paid training allowance equal to the step increase for pay grade bracket VIII-IX for the first month of training. For the succeeding months, Lipio should be paid an allowance equal to the step increase for pay grade bracket VIII-IX plus the step increase for pay grade bracket IX-X, thus:[25] First Month - - - - - P456.00 Second Month - - - - - P1,031.00 Third Month - - - - - P1,031.00 Fourth Month - - - - - P1,031.00 With respect to Ignacio, Sr., he was holding the position of DT-Assembler under Pay Grade VII when he was selected to train for the position of Foreman I under Pay Grade X. Thus, for his first month of training, Ignacio, Sr. should be paid training allowance equal to the step increase under pay grade bracket VII-VIII. For the second month, he should be paid an allowance equal to the step increase under pay grade bracket VII-VIII plus the step increase under pay grade bracket VIII-IX. For the third and fourth months, Ignacio, Sr. should receive an allowance equal to the amount he received for the second month plus the amount equal to the step increase under pay grade bracket IX-X, thus:[26] First Month - - - - - P361.00 Second Month - - - - - P817.00 Third Month - - - - - P1,392.00 Fourth Month - - - - - P1,392.00 For PHILEC\u2019s failure to apply the schedule of step increases under Article X of the June 1, 1997 collective bargaining agreement, PWU argued that PHILEC committed an unfair labor practice under Article 248[27] of the Labor Code.[28]In its position paper,[29] PHILEC emphasized that it promoted Lipio and Ignacio, Sr. while it was still negotiating a new collective bargaining agreement with PWU. Since PHILEC and PWU had not yet negotiated a new collective bargaining agreement when PHILEC selected Lipio and Ignacio, Sr. for training, PHILEC applied the \u201cModified SGV\u201d pay grade scale in computing Lipio\u2019s and Ignacio, Sr.\u2019s training allowance.[30]This \u201cModified SGV\u201d pay grade scale, which PHILEC and PWU allegedly agreed to implement beginning on May 9, 1997, covered both rank-and-file and supervisory employees.[31] According to PHILEC, its past collective bargaining agreements with the rank-and-file and supervisory unions resulted in an overlap of union membership in Pay Grade IX of the rank-and-file employees and Pay Grade A of the supervisory employees.[32] Worse, past collective bargaining agreements resulted in rank-and-file employees under Pay Grades IX and X enjoying higher step increases than supervisory employees under Pay Grades A and B:[33] Pay Grade Scale under the Rank-and-File CBA Step Increase Pay Grade Scale under the Supervisory CBA Step Increase VIII-IX P340.00 A P290.00 IX-X P455.00 A-B P350.00 To preserve the hierarchical wage structure within PHILEC\u2019s enterprise, PHILEC and PWU allegedly agreed to implement the uniform pay grade scale under the \u201cModified SGV\u201d pay grade system, thus:[34] Pay Grade Step Increase Rank-and-File Supervisory I \u2013 II P65.00 II-III P78.00 III-IV P95.00 IV-V P120.00 V-VI P150.00 VI-VII P195.00 VII-VIII P255.00 VIII-IX A P350.00 IX-X A-B P465.00 X-XI B-C P570.00 XI-XII C-D P710.00 D-E P870.00 E-F P1,055.00 Pay grade bracket I\u2013IX covered rank-and-file employees, while pay grade bracket A\u2013F covered supervisory employees.[35]Under the \u201cModified SGV\u201d pay grade scale, the position of Foreman I fell under Pay Grade B. PHILEC then computed Lipio\u2019s and Ignacio, Sr.\u2019s training allowance accordingly.[36]PHILEC disputed PWU\u2019s claim of unfair labor practice. According to PHILEC, it did not violate its collective bargaining agreement with PWU when it implemented the \u201cModified SGV\u201d scale. Even assuming that it violated the collective bargaining agreement, PHILEC argued that its violation was not \u201cgross\u201d or a \u201cflagrant and/or malicious refusal to comply with the economic provisions of [the collective bargaining agreement].\u201d[37] PHILEC, therefore, was not guilty of unfair labor practice.[38]Voluntary Arbitrator Jimenez held in the decision[39] dated August 13, 1999, that PHILEC violated its collective bargaining agreement with PWU.[40] According to Voluntary Arbitrator Jimenez, the June 1, 1997 collective bargaining agreement governed when PHILEC selected Lipio and Ignacio, Sr. for promotion on August 18 and 21, 1997.[41] The provisions of the collective bargaining agreement being the law between the parties, PHILEC should have computed Lipio\u2019s and Ignacio, Sr.\u2019s training allowance based on Article X, Section 4 of the June 1, 1997 collective bargaining agreement.[42]As to PHILEC\u2019s claim that applying Article X, Section 4 would result in salary distortion within PHILEC\u2019s enterprise, Voluntary Arbitrator Jimenez ruled that this was \u201ca concern that PHILEC could have anticipated and could have taken corrective action\u201d[43] before signing the collective bargaining agreement.Voluntary Arbitrator Jimenez dismissed PWU\u2019s claim of unfair labor practice.[44] According to him, PHILEC\u2019s acts \u201ccannot be considered a gross violation of the [collective bargaining agreement] nor . . . [a] flagrant and/or malicious refusal to comply with the economic provisions of the [agreement].\u201d[45]Thus, Voluntary Arbitrator Jimenez ordered PHILEC to pay Lipio and Ignacio, Sr. training allowance based on Article X, Section 4 and Article IX, Section 1 of the June 1, 1997 collective bargaining agreement.[46]PHILEC received a copy of Voluntary Arbitrator Jimenez\u2019s decision on August 16, 1999.[47] On August 26, 1999, PHILEC filed a motion for partial reconsideration[48] of Voluntary Arbitrator Jimenez\u2019s decision.In the resolution[49] dated July 7, 2000, Voluntary Arbitrator Jimenez denied PHILEC\u2019s motion for partial reconsideration for lack of merit. PHILEC received a copy of the July 7, 2000 resolution on August 11, 2000.[50]On August 29, 2000, PHILEC filed a petition[51] for certiorari before the Court of Appeals, alleging that Voluntary Arbitrator Jimenez gravely abused his discretion in rendering his decision.[52] PHILEC maintained that it did not violate the June 1, 1997 collective bargaining agreement.[53] It applied the \u201cModified SGV\u201d pay grade rates to avoid salary distortion within its enterprise.[54]In addition, PHILEC argued that Article X, Section 4 of the collective bargaining agreement did not apply to Lipio and Ignacio, Sr. Considering that Lipio and Ignacio, Sr. were promoted to a supervisory position, their training allowance should be computed based on the provisions of PHILEC\u2019s collective bargaining agreement with ASSET, the exclusive bargaining representative of PHILEC\u2019s supervisory employees.[55]The Court of Appeals affirmed Voluntary Arbitrator Jimenez\u2019s decision.[56] It agreed that PHILEC was bound to apply Article X, Section 4 of its June 1, 1997 collective bargaining agreement with PWU in computing Lipio\u2019s and Ignacio, Sr.\u2019s training allowance.[57] In its decision, the Court of Appeals denied due course and dismissed PHILEC\u2019s petition for certiorari for lack of merit.[58]PHILEC filed a motion for reconsideration, which the Court of Appeals denied in the resolution[59] dated June 23, 2005.On August 3, 2005, PHILEC filed its petition for review on certiorari before this court,[60] insisting that it did not violate its collective bargaining agreement with PWU.[61] PHILEC maintains that Lipio and Ignacio, Sr. were promoted to a position covered by the pay grade scale for supervisory employees.[62] Consequently, the provisions of PHILEC\u2019s collective bargaining agreement with its supervisory employees should apply, not its collective bargaining agreement with PWU.[63] To insist on applying the pay grade scale in Article X, Section 4, PHILEC argues, would result in a salary distortion within PHILEC.[64]In the resolution[65] dated September 21, 2005, this court ordered PWU to comment on PHILEC\u2019s petition for review on certiorari.In its comment,[66] PWU argues that Voluntary Arbitrator Jimenez did not gravely abuse his discretion in rendering his decision. He correctly applied the provisions of the PWU collective bargaining agreement, the law between PHILEC and its rank-and-file employees, in computing Lipio\u2019s and Ignacio, Sr.\u2019s training allowance.[67]On September 27, 2006, PHILEC filed its reply,[68] reiterating its arguments in its petition for review on certiorari.The issue for our resolution is whether Voluntary Arbitrator Jimenez gravely abused his discretion in directing PHILEC to pay Lipio\u2019s and Ignacio, Sr.\u2019s training allowance based on Article X, Section 4 of the June 1, 1997 rank-and-file collective bargaining agreement.This petition should be denied.IThe Voluntary Arbitrator\u2019s decision dated August 13, 1999 is alreadyfinal and executoryWe note that PHILEC filed before the Court of Appeals a petition for certiorari under Rule 65 of the Rules of Court against Voluntary Arbitrator Jimenez\u2019s decision.[69]This was not the proper remedy.Instead, the proper remedy to reverse or modify a Voluntary Arbitrator\u2019s or a panel of Voluntary Arbitrators\u2019 decision or award is to appeal the award or decision before the Court of Appeals. Rule 43, Sections 1 and 3 of the Rules of Court provide:Section 1. Scope.This Rule shall apply to appeals from judgments or final orders of the Court of Tax Appeals and from awards, judgments, final orders or resolutions of or authorized by any quasi-judicial agency in the exercise of its quasi-judicial functions. Among these agencies are the Civil Service Commission, Central Board of Assessment Appeals, Securities and Exchange Commission, Office of the President, Land Registration Authority, Social Security Commission, Civil Aeronautics Board, Bureau of Patents, Trademarks and Technology Transfer, National Electrification Administration, Energy Regulatory Board, National Telecommunications Commission, Department of Agrarian Reform under Republic Act No. 6657, Government Service Insurance System, Employees Compensation Commission, Agricultural Inventions Board, Insurance Commission, Philippine Atomic Energy Commission, Board of Investments, Construction Industry Arbitration Commission, and voluntary arbitrators authorized by law.. . . .Sec. 3. Where to appeal.An appeal under this Rule may be taken to the Court of Appeals within the period and in the manner herein provided, whether the appeal involves questions of fact, of law, or mixed questions of fact and law. (Emphasis supplied)A Voluntary Arbitrator or a panel of Voluntary Arbitrators has the exclusive original jurisdiction over grievances arising from the interpretation or implementation of collective bargaining agreements. Should the parties agree, a Voluntary Arbitrator or a panel of Voluntary Arbitrators shall also resolve the parties\u2019 other labor disputes, including unfair labor practices and bargaining deadlocks. Articles 261 and 262 of the Labor Code provide:ART. 261. JURISDICTION OF VOLUNTARY ARBITRATORS OR PANEL OF VOLUNTARY ARBITRATORS.The Voluntary Arbitrator or panel of Voluntary Arbitrators shall have original and exclusive jurisdiction to hear and decide all unresolved grievances arising from the interpretation or implementation of the Collective Bargaining Agreement and those arising from the interpretation or enforcement of company personnel policies referred to in the immediately preceding article. Accordingly, violations of a Collective Bargaining Agreement, except those which are gross in character, shall no longer be treated as unfair labor practice and shall be resolved as grievances under the Collective Bargaining Agreement. For purposes of this article, gross violations of Collective Bargaining Agreement shall mean flagrant and/or malicious refusal to comply with the economic provisions of such agreement.The Commission, its Regional Offices and the Regional Directors of the Department of Labor and Employment shall not entertain disputes, grievances, or matters under the exclusive and original jurisdiction of the Voluntary Arbitrator or panel of Voluntary Arbitrators and shall immediately dispose and refer the same to the Grievance Machinery or Voluntary Arbitration provided in the Collective Bargaining Agreement.ART. 262. JURISDICTION OVER OTHER LABOR DISPUTES.The Voluntary Arbitrator or panel of Voluntary Arbitrators, upon agreement of the parties, shall also hear and decide all other labor disputes including unfair labor practices and bargaining deadlocks.In Luzon Development Bank v. Association of Luzon Development Bank Employees,[70] this court ruled that the proper remedy against the award or decision of the Voluntary Arbitrator is an appeal before the Court of Appeals. This court first characterized the office of a Voluntary Arbitrator or a panel of Voluntary Arbitrators as a quasi-judicial agency, citing Volkschel Labor Union, et al. v. NLRC[71] and Oceanic Bic Division (FFW) v. Romero:[72]In Volkschel Labor Union, et al. v. NLRC, et al., on the settled premise that the judgments of courts and awards of quasi-judicial agencies must become final at some definite time, this Court ruled that the awards of voluntary arbitrators determine the rights of parties; hence, their decisions have the same legal effect as judgments of a court. In Oceanic Bic Division (FFW), et al. v. Romero, et al., this Court ruled that \"a voluntary arbitrator by the nature of her functions acts in a quasi-judicial capacity.\" Under these rulings, it follows that the voluntary arbitrator, whether acting solely or in a panel, enjoys in law the status of a quasi-judicial agency but independent of, and apart from, the NLRC since his decisions are not appealable to the latter.[73] (Citations omitted)This court then stated that the office of a Voluntary Arbitrator or a panel of Voluntary Arbitrators, even assuming that the office is not strictly a quasi-judicial agency, may be considered an instrumentality, thus:Assuming arguendo that the voluntary arbitrator or the panel of voluntary arbitrators may not strictly be considered as a quasi-judicial agency, board or commission, still both he and the panel are comprehended within the concept of a \"quasi-judicial instrumentality.\" It may even be stated that it was to meet the very situation presented by the quasi-judicial functions of the voluntary arbitrators here, as well as the subsequent arbitrator/arbitral tribunal operating under the Construction Industry Arbitration Commission, that the broader term \"instrumentalities\" was purposely included in the above-quoted provision.An \"instrumentality\" is anything used as a means or agency. Thus, the terms governmental \"agency\" or \"instrumentality\" are synonymous in the sense that either of them is a means by which a government acts, or by which a certain government act or function is performed. The word \"instrumentality,\" with respect to a state, contemplates an authority to which the state delegates governmental power for the performance of a state function. An individual person, like an administrator or executor, is a judicial instrumentality in the settling of an estate, in the same manner that a sub-agent appointed by a bankruptcy court is an instrumentality of the court, and a trustee in bankruptcy of a defunct corporation is an instrumentality of the state.The voluntary arbitrator no less performs a state function pursuant to a governmental power delegated to him under the provisions therefor in the Labor Code and he falls, therefore, within the contemplation of the term \"instrumentality\" in the aforequoted Sec. 9 of B.P. 129. [74] (Citations omitted)Since the office of a Voluntary Arbitrator or a panel of Voluntary Arbitrators is considered a quasi-judicial agency, this court concluded that a decision or award rendered by a Voluntary Arbitrator is appealable before the Court of Appeals. Under Section 9 of the Judiciary Reorganization Act of 1980, the Court of Appeals has the exclusive original jurisdiction over decisions or awards of quasi-judicial agencies and instrumentalities:Section 9. Jurisdiction. The Court of Appeals shall exercise:. . . .3. Exclusive appellate jurisdiction over all final judgements, resolutions, orders or awards of Regional Trial Courts and quasi-judicial agencies, instrumentalities, boards or commission, including the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Social Security Commission, the Employees Compensation Commission and the Civil Service Commission, except those falling within the appellate jurisdiction of the Supreme Court in accordance with the Constitution, the Labor Code of the Philippines under Presidential Decree No. 442, as amended, the provisions of this Act, and of subparagraph (1) of the third paragraph and subparagraph 4 of the fourth paragraph of Section 17 of the Judiciary Act of 1948. (Emphasis supplied)Luzon Development Bank was decided in 1995 but remains \u201cgood law.\u201d[75] In the 2002 case of Alcantara, Jr. v. Court of Appeals,[76] this court rejected petitioner Santiago Alcantara, Jr.\u2019s argument that the Rules of Court, specifically Rule 43, Section 2, superseded the Luzon Development Bank ruling:Petitioner argues, however, that Luzon Development Bank is no longer good law because of Section 2, Rule 43 of the Rules of Court, a new provision introduced by the 1997 revision. The provision reads:SEC. 2. Cases not covered. - This Rule shall not apply to judgments or final orders issued under the Labor Code of the Philippines.The provisions may be new to the Rules of Court but it is far from being a new law. Section 2, Rule 42 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure, as presently worded, is nothing more but a reiteration of the exception to the exclusive appellate jurisdiction of the Court of Appeals, as provided for in Section 9, Batas Pambansa Blg. 129,7 as amended by Republic Act No. 7902:8(3) Exclusive appellate jurisdiction over all final judgments, decisions, resolutions, orders or awards of Regional Trial Courts and quasi-judicial agencies, instrumentalities, boards or commissions, including the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Employees\u2019 Compensation Commission and the Civil Service Commission, except those falling within the appellate jurisdiction of the Supreme Court in accordance with the Constitution, the Labor Code of the Philippines under Presidential Decree No. 442, as amended, the provisions of this Act and of subparagraph (1) of the third paragraph and subparagraph (4) of the fourth paragraph of Section 17 of the Judiciary Act of 1948.The Court took into account this exception in Luzon Development Bank but, nevertheless, held that the decisions of voluntary arbitrators issued pursuant to the Labor Code do not come within its ambit:x x x. The fact that [the voluntary arbitrator\u2019s] functions and powers are provided for in the Labor Code does not place him within the exceptions to said Sec. 9 since he is a quasi-judicial instrumentality as contemplated therein. It will be noted that, although the Employees\u2019 Compensation Commission is also provided for in the Labor Code, Circular No. 1-91, which is the forerunner of the present Revised Administrative Circular No. 1-95, laid down the procedure for the appealability of its decisions to the Court of Appeals under the foregoing rationalization, and this was later adopted by Republic Act No. 7902 in amending Sec. 9 of B.P. 129.A fortiori, the decision or award of the voluntary arbitrator or panel of arbitrators should likewise be appealable to the Court of Appeals, in line with the procedure outlined in Revised Administrative Circular No. 1-95, just like those of the quasi-judicial agencies, boards and commissions enumerated therein.[77] (Emphases in the original)This court has since reiterated the Luzon Development Bank ruling in its decisions.[78]Article 262-A of the Labor Code provides that the award or decision of the Voluntary Arbitrator \u201cshall be final and executory after ten (10) calendar days from receipt of the copy of the award or decision by the parties\u201d:Art. 262-A. PROCEDURES. The Voluntary Arbitrator or panel of Voluntary Arbitrators shall have the power to hold hearings, receive evidences and take whatever action is necessary to resolve the issue or issues subject of the dispute, including efforts to effect a voluntary settlement between parties.All parties to the dispute shall be entitled to attend the arbitration proceedings. The attendance of any third party or the exclusion of any witness from the proceedings shall be determined by the Voluntary Arbitrator or panel of Voluntary Arbitrators. Hearing may be adjourned for cause or upon agreement by the parties.Unless the parties agree otherwise, it shall be mandatory for the Voluntary Arbitrator or panel of Voluntary Arbitrators to render an award or decision within twenty (20) calendar days from the date of submission of the dispute to voluntary arbitration.The award or decision of the Voluntary Arbitrator or panel of Voluntary Arbitrators shall contain the facts and the law on which it is based. It shall be final and executory after ten (10) calendar days from receipt of the copy of the award or decision by the parties.Upon motion of any interested party, the Voluntary Arbitrator or panel of Voluntary Arbitrators or the Labor Arbiter in the region where the movant resides, in case of the absence or incapacity of the Voluntary Arbitrator or panel of Voluntary Arbitrators, for any reason, may issue a writ of execution requiring either the sheriff of the Commission or regular courts or any public official whom the parties may designate in the submission agreement to execute the final decision, order or award. (Emphasis supplied)Thus, in Coca-Cola Bottlers Philippines, Inc. Sales Force Union-PTGWO-BALAIS v. Coca Cola-Bottlers Philippines, Inc.,[79] this court declared that the decision of the Voluntary Arbitrator had become final and executory because it was appealed beyond the 10-day reglementary period under Article 262-A of the Labor Code.It is true that Rule 43, Section 4 of the Rules of Court provides for a 15-day reglementary period for filing an appeal:Section 4. Period of appeal. \u2014 The appeal shall be taken within fifteen (15) days from notice of the award, judgment, final order or resolution, or from the date of its last publication, if publication is required by law for its effectivity, or of the denial of petitioner's motion for new trial or reconsideration duly filed in accordance with the governing law of the court or agency a quo. Only one (1) motion for reconsideration shall be allowed. Upon proper motion and the payment of the full amount of the docket fee before the expiration of the reglementary period, the Court of Appeals may grant an additional period of fifteen (15) days only within which to file the petition for review. No further extension shall be granted except for the most compelling reason and in no case to exceed fifteen (15) days. (Emphasis supplied)The 15-day reglementary period has been upheld by this court in a long line of cases.[80] In AMA Computer College-Santiago City, Inc. v. Nacino,[81] Nippon Paint Employees Union-OLALIA v. Court of Appeals,[82] Manila Midtown Hotel v. Borromeo,[83] and Sevilla Trading Company v. Semana,[84] this court denied petitioners\u2019 petitions for review on certiorari since petitioners failed to appeal the Voluntary Arbitrator\u2019s decision within the 15-day reglementary period under Rule 43. In these cases, the Court of Appeals had no jurisdiction to entertain the appeal assailing the Voluntary Arbitrator\u2019s decision.Despite Rule 43 providing for a 15-day period to appeal, we rule that the Voluntary Arbitrator\u2019s decision must be appealed before the Court of Appeals within 10 calendar days from receipt of the decision as provided in the Labor Code.Appeal is a \u201cstatutory privilege,\u201d[85] which may be exercised \u201conly in the manner and in accordance with the provisions of the law.\u201d[86] \u201cPerfection of an appeal within the reglementary period is not only mandatory but also jurisdictional so that failure to do so rendered the decision final and executory, and deprives the appellate court of jurisdiction to alter the final judgment much less to entertain the appeal.\u201d[87]We ruled that Article 262-A of the Labor Code allows the appeal of decisions rendered by Voluntary Arbitrators.[88] Statute provides that the Voluntary Arbitrator\u2019s decision \u201cshall be final and executory after ten (10) calendar days from receipt of the copy of the award or decision by the parties.\u201d Being provided in the statute, this 10-day period must be complied with; otherwise, no appellate court will have jurisdiction over the appeal. This absurd situation occurs when the decision is appealed on the 11th to 15th day from receipt as allowed under the Rules, but which decision, under the law, has already become final and executory.Furthermore, under Article VIII, Section 5(5) of the Constitution, this court \u201cshall not diminish, increase, or modify substantive rights\u201d in promulgating rules of procedure in courts.[89] The 10-day period to appeal under the Labor Code being a substantive right, this period cannot be diminished, increased, or modified through the Rules of Court.[90]In Shioji v. Harvey,[91] this court held that the \u201crules of court, promulgated by authority of law, have the force and effect of law, if not in conflict with positive law.\u201d[92] Rules of Court are \u201csubordinate to the statute.\u201d[93] In case of conflict between the law and the Rules of Court, \u201cthe statute will prevail.\u201d[94]The rule, therefore, is that a Voluntary Arbitrator\u2019s award or decision shall be appealed before the Court of Appeals within 10 days from receipt of the award or decision. Should the aggrieved party choose to file a motion for reconsideration with the Voluntary Arbitrator,[95] the motion must be filed within the same 10-day period since a motion for reconsideration is filed \u201cwithin the period for taking an appeal.\u201d[96]A petition for certiorari is a special civil action \u201cadopted to correct errors of jurisdiction committed by the lower court or quasi-judicial agency, or when there is grave abuse of discretion on the part of such court or agency amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction.\u201d[97] An extraordinary remedy,[98] a petition for certiorari may be filed only if appeal is not available.[99] If appeal is available, an appeal must be taken even if the ground relied upon is grave abuse of discretion.[100]As an exception to the rule, this court has allowed petitions for certiorari to be filed in lieu of an appeal \u201c(a) when the public welfare and the advancement of public policy dictate; (b) when the broader interests of justice so require; (c) when the writs issued are null; and (d) when the questioned order amounts to an oppressive exercise of judicial authority.\u201d[101]In Unicraft Industries International Corporation, et al. v. The Hon. Court of Appeals,[102] petitioners filed a petition for certiorari against the Voluntary Arbitrator\u2019s decision. Finding that the Voluntary Arbitrator rendered an award without giving petitioners an opportunity to present evidence, this court allowed petitioners\u2019 petition for certiorari despite being the wrong remedy. The Voluntary Arbitrator\u2019s award, this court said, was null and void for violation of petitioners\u2019 right to due process. This court decided the case on the merits.In Leyte IV Electric Cooperative, Inc. v. LEYECO IV Employees Union-ALU,[103] petitioner likewise filed a petition for certiorari against the Voluntary Arbitrator\u2019s decision, alleging that the decision lacked basis in fact and in law. Ruling that the petition for certiorari was filed within the reglementary period for filing an appeal, this court allowed petitioner\u2019s petition for certiorari in \u201cthe broader interests of justice.\u201d[104]In Mora v. Avesco Marketing Corporation,[105] this court held that petitioner Noel E. Mora erred in filing a petition for certiorari against the Voluntary Arbitrator\u2019s decision. Nevertheless, this court decided the case on the merits \u201cin the interest of substantial justice to arrive at the proper conclusion that is conformable to the evidentiary facts.\u201d[106]None of the circumstances similar to Unicraft, Leyte IV Electric Cooperative, and Mora are present in this case. PHILEC received Voluntary Arbitrator Jimenez\u2019s resolution denying its motion for partial reconsideration on August 11, 2000.[107] PHILEC filed its petition for certiorari before the Court of Appeals on August 29, 2000,[108] which was 18 days after its receipt of Voluntary Arbitrator Jimenez\u2019s resolution. The petition for certiorari was filed beyond the 10-day reglementary period for filing an appeal. We cannot consider PHILEC\u2019s petition for certiorari as an appeal.There being no appeal seasonably filed in this case, Voluntary Arbitrator Jimenez\u2019s decision became final and executory after 10 calendar days from PHILEC\u2019s receipt of the resolution denying its motion for partial reconsideration.[109] Voluntary Arbitrator Jimenez\u2019s decision is already \u201cbeyond the purview of this Court to act upon.\u201d[110]IIPHILEC must pay training allowance based on the step increases providedin the June 1, 1997 collective bargaining agreementThe insurmountable procedural issue notwithstanding, the case will also fail on its merits. Voluntary Arbitrator Jimenez correctly awarded both Lipio and Ignacio, Sr. training allowances based on the amounts and formula provided in the June 1, 1997 collective bargaining agreement.A collective bargaining agreement is \u201ca contract executed upon the request of either the employer or the exclusive bargaining representative of the employees incorporating the agreement reached after negotiations with respect to wages, hours of work and all other terms and conditions of employment, including proposals for adjusting any grievances or questions arising under such agreement.\u201d[111] A collective bargaining agreement being a contract, its provisions \u201cconstitute the law between the parties\u201d[112] and must be complied with in good faith.[113]PHILEC, as employer, and PWU, as the exclusive bargaining representative of PHILEC\u2019s rank-and-file employees, entered into a collective bargaining agreement, which the parties agreed to make effective from June 1, 1997 to May 31, 1999. Being the law between the parties, the June 1, 1997 collective bargaining agreement must govern PHILEC and its rank-and-file employees within the agreed period.Lipio and Ignacio, Sr. were rank-and-file employees when PHILEC selected them for training for the position of Foreman I beginning August 25, 1997. Lipio and Ignacio, Sr. were selected for training during the effectivity of the June 1, 1997 rank-and-file collective bargaining agreement. Therefore, Lipio\u2019s and Ignacio, Sr.\u2019s training allowance must be computed based on Article X, Section 4 and Article IX, Section 1(f) of the June 1, 1997 collective bargaining agreement.Contrary to PHILEC\u2019s claim, Lipio and Ignacio, Sr. were not transferred out of the bargaining unit when they were selected for training. Lipio and Ignacio, Sr. remained rank-and-file employees while they trained for the position of Foreman I. Under Article IX, Section 1(e) of the June 1, 1997 collective bargaining agreement,[114] a trainee who is \u201cunable to demonstrate his ability to perform the work . . . shall be reverted to his previous assignment. . . .\u201d[115] According to the same provision, the trainee \u201cshall hold that job on a trial or observation basis and . . . subject to prior approval of the authorized management official, be appointed to the position in a regular capacity.\u201d[116]Thus, training is a condition precedent for promotion. Selection for training does not mean automatic transfer out of the bargaining unit of rank-and-file employees.Moreover, the June 1, 1997 collective bargaining agreement states that the training allowance of a rank-and-file employee \u201cwhose application for a posted job is accepted shall [be computed] in accordance with Section (f) of [Article IX].\u201d[117] Since Lipio and Ignacio, Sr. were rank-and-file employees when they applied for training for the position of Foreman I, Lipio\u2019s and Ignacio, Sr.\u2019s training allowance must be computed based on Article IX, Section 1(f) of the June 1, 1997 rank-and-file collective bargaining agreement.PHILEC allegedly applied the \u201cModified SGV\u201d pay grade scale to prevent any salary distortion within PHILEC\u2019s enterprise. This, however, does not justify PHILEC\u2019s non-compliance with the June 1, 1997 collective bargaining agreement. This pay grade scale is not provided in the collective bargaining agreement. In Samahang Manggagawa sa Top Form Manufacturing United Workers of the Philippines (SMTFM-UWP) v. NLRC,[118] this court ruled that \u201conly provisions embodied in the [collective bargaining agreement] should be so interpreted and complied with. Where a proposal raised by a contracting party does not find print in the [collective bargaining agreement], it is not part thereof and the proponent has no claim whatsoever to its implementation.\u201d[119]Had PHILEC wanted the \u201cModified SGV\u201d pay grade scale applied within its enterprise, \u201cit could have requested or demanded that [the \u2018Modified SGV\u2019 scale] be incorporated in the [collective bargaining agreement].\u201d[120] PHILEC had \u201cthe means under the law to compel [PWU] to incorporate this specific economic proposal in the [collective bargaining agreement].\u201d[121] It \u201ccould have invoked Article 252 of the Labor Code\u201d[122] to incorporate the \u201cModified SGV\u201d pay grade scale in its collective bargaining agreement with PWU. But it did not. Since this \u201cModified SGV\u201d pay grade scale does not appear in PHILEC\u2019s collective bargaining agreement with PWU, PHILEC cannot insist on the \u201cModified SGV\u201d pay grade scale\u2019s application. We reiterate Voluntary Arbitrator Jimenez\u2019s decision dated August 13, 1999 where he said that:. . . since the signing of the current CBA took place on September 27, 1997, PHILEC, by oversight, may have overlooked the possibility of a wage distortion occurring among ASSET-occupied positions. It is surmised that this matter could have been negotiated and settled with PWU before the actual signing of the CBA on September 27. Instead, PHILEC, again, allowed the provisions of Art. X, Sec. 4 of the CBA to remain the way it is and is now suffering the consequences of its laches.[123] (Emphasis in the original)We note that PHILEC did not dispute PWU\u2019s contention that it selected several rank-and-file employees for training and paid them training allowance based on the schedule provided in the collective bargaining agreement effective at the time of the trainees\u2019 selection.[124] PHILEC cannot choose when and to whom to apply the provisions of its collective bargaining agreement. The provisions of a collective bargaining agreement must be applied uniformly and complied with in good faith.Given the foregoing, Lipio\u2019s and Ignacio, Sr.\u2019s training allowance should be computed based on Article X, Section 4 in relation to Article IX, Section 1(f) of the June 1, 1997 rank-and-file collective bargaining agreement. Lipio, who held the position of Machinist before selection for training as Foreman I, should receive training allowance based on the following schedule: First Month - - - - - P456.00 Second Month - - - - - P1,031.00 Third Month - - - - - P1,031.00 Fourth Month - - - - - P1,031.00 Ignacio, Sr., who held the position of DT-Assembler before selection for training as Foreman I, should receive training allowance based on the following schedule: First Month - - - - - P361.00 Second Month - - - - - P817.00 Third Month - - - - - P1,392.00 Fourth Month - - - - - P1,392.00 Considering that Voluntary Arbitrator Jimenez\u2019s decision awarded sums of money, Lipio and Ignacio, Sr. are entitled to legal interest on their training allowances. Voluntary Arbitrator Jimenez\u2019s decision having become final and executory on August 22, 2000, PHILEC is liable for legal interest equal to 12% per annum from finality of the decision until full payment as this court ruled in Eastern Shipping Lines, Inc. v. Court of Appeals:[125]When the judgment of the court awarding a sum of money becomes final and executory, the rate of legal interest. . . shall be 12% per annum from such finality until its satisfaction, this interim period being deemed to be by then as equivalent to a forbearance of credit.[126]The 6% legal interest under Circular No. 799, Series of 2013, of the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas Monetary Board shall not apply, Voluntary Arbitrator Jimenez\u2019s decision having become final and executory prior to the effectivity of the circular on July 1, 2013. In Nacar v. Gallery Frames,[127] we held that:. . . with regard to those judgments that have become final and executory prior to July 1, 2013, said judgments shall not be disturbed and shall continue to be implemented applying the rate of interest fixed therein.[128]WHEREFORE, the petition for review on certiorari is DENIED. The Court of Appeals\u2019 decision dated May 25, 2004 is AFFIRMED.Petitioner Philippine Electric Corporation is ORDERED to PAY respondent Eleodoro V. Lipio a total of P3,549.00 for a four (4)-month training for the position of Foreman I with legal interest of 12% per annum from August 22, 2000 until the amount\u2019s full satisfaction.For respondent Emerlito C. Ignacio, Sr., Philippine Electric Corporation is ORDERED to PAY a total of P3,962.00 for a four (4)-month training for the position of Foreman I with legal interest of 12% per annum from August 22, 2000 until the amount\u2019s full satisfaction.SO ORDERED.Carpio, (Chairperson), Del Castillo, Villarama, Jr.,* and Mendoza, JJ., concur.* Designated acting member per Special Order No. 1888 dated November 28, 2014.[1] Rollo, pp. 9\u201329.[2] Id. at 32\u201340.

[14]\nOn September 17, 1997, PHILEC and PWU entered into a new collective bargaining agreement, effective retroactively on June 1, 1997 and expiring on May 31, 1999. [15] Under Article X, Section 4 of the June 1, 1997 collective bargaining agreement, a rank-and-file employee promoted shall be entitled to the following step increases in his or her basic salary: [16]\n\nSection 4. STEP INCREASES. [Philippine Electric Corporation] shall adopt the following step increases on the basic salary in case of promotion effective June 1, 1997. Such increases shall be based on the scale below or upon the minimum of the new pay grade to which the employee is promoted, whichever is higher:\n\n[TABLE_CONTENT]\nPay Grade | Step Increase\nI - II | P80.00\nII - III | P105.00\nIII - IV | P136.00\nIV - V | P175.00\nV - VI | P224.00\nVI - VII | P285.00\nVII - VIII | P361.00\nVIII - IX | P456.00\nIX - X | P575.00\n[END_TABLE]\n\nPay Grade Step Increase I - II P80.00 II - III P105.00 III - IV P136.00 IV - V P175.00 V - VI P224.00 VI - VII P285.00 VII - VIII P361.00 VIII - IX P456.00 IX - X P575.00\nTo be promoted, a rank-and-file employee shall undergo training or observation and shall receive training allowance as provided in Article IX, Section 1(f) of the June 1, 1997 collective bargaining agreement: [17]\n\nSection 1. JOB POSTING AND BIDDING:\n\n. . . .\n\n(f) Allowance for employees under Training or Observation shall be on a graduated basis as follows:\n\nFor the first month of training, the allowance should be equivalent to one step increase of the next higher grade. Every month thereafter the corresponding increase shall be equivalent to the next higher grade until the allowance for the grade applied for is attained.\n\nAs an example, if a Grade I employee qualifies for a Grade III position, he will receive the training allowance for Grade I to Grade II for the first month. On the second month, he will receive the training allowance for Grade I to Grade II plus the allowance for Grade II to Grade III. He will then continue to receive this amount until he finishes his training or observation period. [18]\nClaiming that the schedule of training allowance stated in the memoranda served on Lipio and Ignacio, Sr. did not conform to Article X, Section 4 of the June 1, 1997 collective bargaining agreement, PWU submitted the grievance to the grievance machinery. [19]\n\nPWU and PHILEC failed to amicably settle their grievance. Thus, on December 21, 1998, the parties filed a submission agreement [20] with the National Conciliation and Mediation Board, submitting the following issues to voluntary arbitration:\n\nI\n\nWHETHER OR NOT PHILEC VIOLATED SECTION 4 (Step Increases) ARTICLE X (Wage and Position Standardization) OF THE EXISTING COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENT (CBA) IN IMPLEMENTING THE STEP INCREASES RELATIVE TO THE PROMOTION OF INDIVIDUAL COMPLAINANTS.\n\nII\n\nWHETHER OR NOT PHILEC\u2019s MANNER OF IMPLEMENTING THE STEP INCREASES IN CONNECTION WITH THE PROMOTION OF INDIVIDUAL COMPLAINANTS IN RELATION TO THE PROVISIONS OF SECTION 4, ARTICLE X OF THE CBA CONSTITUTES UNFAIR LABOR PRACTICE. [21]\nIn their submission agreement, PWU and PHILEC designated Hon. Ramon T. Jimenez as Voluntary Arbitrator (Voluntary Arbitrator Jimenez). [22]\n\nVoluntary Arbitrator Jimenez, in the order [23] dated January 4, 1999, directed the parties to file their respective position papers.\n\nIn its position paper, [24] PWU maintained that PHILEC failed to follow the schedule of step increases under Article X, Section 4 of the June 1, 1997 collective bargaining agreement. Machinist I, Lipio\u2019s position before he underwent training for Foreman I, fell under Pay Grade VIII, while Foreman I fell under Pay Grade X. Following the schedule under Article X, Section 4 of the June 1, 1997 collective bargaining agreement and the formula under Article IX, Section 1(f), Lipio should be paid training allowance equal to the step increase for pay grade bracket VIII-IX for the first month of training. For the succeeding months, Lipio should be paid an allowance equal to the step increase for pay grade bracket VIII-IX plus the step increase for pay grade bracket IX-X, thus: [25]\n\n[TABLE_CONTENT]\nFirst Month | - - - - - | P456.00\nSecond Month | - - - - - | P1,031.00\nThird Month | - - - - - | P1,031.00\nFourth Month | - - - - - | P1,031.00\n[END_TABLE]\n\nFirst Month - - - - - P456.00 Second Month - - - - - P1,031.00 Third Month - - - - - P1,031.00 Fourth Month - - - - - P1,031.00\nWith respect to Ignacio, Sr., he was holding the position of DT-Assembler under Pay Grade VII when he was selected to train for the position of Foreman I under Pay Grade X. Thus, for his first month of training, Ignacio, Sr. should be paid training allowance equal to the step increase under pay grade bracket VII-VIII. For the second month, he should be paid an allowance equal to the step increase under pay grade bracket VII-VIII plus the step increase under pay grade bracket VIII-IX. For the third and fourth months, Ignacio, Sr. should receive an allowance equal to the amount he received for the second month plus the amount equal to the step increase under pay grade bracket IX-X, thus: [26]\n\n[TABLE_CONTENT]\nFirst Month | - - - - - | P361.00\nSecond Month | - - - - - | P817.00\nThird Month | - - - - - | P1,392.00\nFourth Month | - - - - - | P1,392.00\n[END_TABLE]\n\nFirst Month - - - - - P361.00 Second Month - - - - - P817.00 Third Month - - - - - P1,392.00 Fourth Month - - - - - P1,392.00\nFor PHILEC\u2019s failure to apply the schedule of step increases under Article X of the June 1, 1997 collective bargaining agreement, PWU argued that PHILEC committed an unfair labor practice under Article 248 [27] of the Labor Code. [28]\n\nIn its position paper, [29] PHILEC emphasized that it promoted Lipio and Ignacio, Sr. while it was still negotiating a new collective bargaining agreement with PWU. Since PHILEC and PWU had not yet negotiated a new collective bargaining agreement when PHILEC selected Lipio and Ignacio, Sr. for training, PHILEC applied the \u201cModified SGV\u201d pay grade scale in computing Lipio\u2019s and Ignacio, Sr.\u2019s training allowance. [30]\n\nThis \u201cModified SGV\u201d pay grade scale, which PHILEC and PWU allegedly agreed to implement beginning on May 9, 1997, covered both rank-and-file and supervisory employees. [31] According to PHILEC, its past collective bargaining agreements with the rank-and-file and supervisory unions resulted in an overlap of union membership in Pay Grade IX of the rank-and-file employees and Pay Grade A of the supervisory employees. [32] Worse, past collective bargaining agreements resulted in rank-and-file employees under Pay Grades IX and X enjoying higher step increases than supervisory employees under Pay Grades A and B: [33]\n\n[TABLE_CONTENT]\nPay GradeScale under theRank-and-FileCBA | Step Increase | Pay Grade Scaleunder theSupervisory CBA | Step Increase\nVIII-IX | P340.00 | A | P290.00\nIX-X | P455.00 | A-B | P350.00\n[END_TABLE]\n\nPay Grade\nScale under the\nRank-and-File\nCBA Step Increase Pay Grade Scale\nunder the\nSupervisory CBA Step Increase VIII-IX P340.00 A\n\nP290.00 IX-X P455.00 A-B P350.00\nTo preserve the hierarchical wage structure within PHILEC\u2019s enterprise, PHILEC and PWU allegedly agreed to implement the uniform pay grade scale under the \u201cModified SGV\u201d pay grade system, thus: [34]\n\n[TABLE_CONTENT]\nPay Grade | Step Increase\nRank-and-File | Supervisory | \nI \u2013 II | | P65.00\nII-III | | P78.00\nIII-IV | | P95.00\nIV-V | | P120.00\nV-VI | | P150.00\nVI-VII | | P195.00\nVII-VIII | | P255.00\nVIII-IX | A | P350.00\nIX-X | A-B | P465.00\nX-XI | B-C | P570.00\nXI-XII | C-D | P710.00\n | D-E | P870.00\n | E-F | P1,055.00\n[END_TABLE]\n\nPay Grade Step Increase Rank-and-File Supervisory\nI \u2013 II\nP65.00 II-III\nP78.00 III-IV\nP95.00 IV-V\nP120.00 V-VI\nP150.00 VI-VII\nP195.00 VII-VIII\nP255.00 VIII-IX A P350.00 IX-X A-B P465.00 X-XI B-C P570.00 XI-XII C-D P710.00\nD-E P870.00\nE-F P1,055.00\nPay grade bracket I\u2013IX covered rank-and-file employees, while pay grade bracket A\u2013F covered supervisory employees. [35]\n\nUnder the \u201cModified SGV\u201d pay grade scale, the position of Foreman I fell under Pay Grade B. PHILEC then computed Lipio\u2019s and Ignacio, Sr.\u2019s training allowance accordingly. [36]\n\nPHILEC disputed PWU\u2019s claim of unfair labor practice. According to PHILEC, it did not violate its collective bargaining agreement with PWU when it implemented the \u201cModified SGV\u201d scale. Even assuming that it violated the collective bargaining agreement, PHILEC argued that its violation was not \u201cgross\u201d or a \u201cflagrant and/or malicious refusal to comply with the economic provisions of [the collective bargaining agreement].\u201d [37] PHILEC, therefore, was not guilty of unfair labor practice. [38]\n\nVoluntary Arbitrator Jimenez held in the decision [39] dated August 13, 1999, that PHILEC violated its collective bargaining agreement with PWU. [40] According to Voluntary Arbitrator Jimenez, the June 1, 1997 collective bargaining agreement governed when PHILEC selected Lipio and Ignacio, Sr. for promotion on August 18 and 21, 1997. [41] The provisions of the collective bargaining agreement being the law between the parties, PHILEC should have computed Lipio\u2019s and Ignacio, Sr.\u2019s training allowance based on Article X, Section 4 of the June 1, 1997 collective bargaining agreement. [42]\n\nAs to PHILEC\u2019s claim that applying Article X, Section 4 would result in salary distortion within PHILEC\u2019s enterprise, Voluntary Arbitrator Jimenez ruled that this was \u201ca concern that PHILEC could have anticipated and could have taken corrective action\u201d [43] before signing the collective bargaining agreement.\n\nVoluntary Arbitrator Jimenez dismissed PWU\u2019s claim of unfair labor practice. [44] According to him, PHILEC\u2019s acts \u201ccannot be considered a gross violation of the [collective bargaining agreement] nor . . . [a] flagrant and/or malicious refusal to comply with the economic provisions of the [agreement].\u201d [45]\n\nThus, Voluntary Arbitrator Jimenez ordered PHILEC to pay Lipio and Ignacio, Sr. training allowance based on Article X, Section 4 and Article IX, Section 1 of the June 1, 1997 collective bargaining agreement. [46]\n\nPHILEC received a copy of Voluntary Arbitrator Jimenez\u2019s decision on August 16, 1999. [47] On August 26, 1999, PHILEC filed a motion for partial reconsideration [48] of Voluntary Arbitrator Jimenez\u2019s decision.\n\nIn the resolution [49] dated July 7, 2000, Voluntary Arbitrator Jimenez denied PHILEC\u2019s motion for partial reconsideration for lack of merit. PHILEC received a copy of the July 7, 2000 resolution on August 11, 2000. [50]\n\nOn August 29, 2000, PHILEC filed a petition [51] for certiorari before the Court of Appeals, alleging that Voluntary Arbitrator Jimenez gravely abused his discretion in rendering his decision. [52] PHILEC maintained that it did not violate the June 1, 1997 collective bargaining agreement. [53] It applied the \u201cModified SGV\u201d pay grade rates to avoid salary distortion within its enterprise. [54]\n\nIn addition, PHILEC argued that Article X, Section 4 of the collective bargaining agreement did not apply to Lipio and Ignacio, Sr. Considering that Lipio and Ignacio, Sr. were promoted to a supervisory position, their training allowance should be computed based on the provisions of PHILEC\u2019s collective bargaining agreement with ASSET, the exclusive bargaining representative of PHILEC\u2019s supervisory employees. [55]\n\nThe Court of Appeals affirmed Voluntary Arbitrator Jimenez\u2019s decision. [56] It agreed that PHILEC was bound to apply Article X, Section 4 of its June 1, 1997 collective bargaining agreement with PWU in computing Lipio\u2019s and Ignacio, Sr.\u2019s training allowance. [57] In its decision, the Court of Appeals denied due course and dismissed PHILEC\u2019s petition for certiorari for lack of merit. [58]\n\nPHILEC filed a motion for reconsideration, which the Court of Appeals denied in the resolution [59] dated June 23, 2005.\n\nOn August 3, 2005, PHILEC filed its petition for review on certiorari before this court, [60] insisting that it did not violate its collective bargaining agreement with PWU. [61] PHILEC maintains that Lipio and Ignacio, Sr. were promoted to a position covered by the pay grade scale for supervisory employees. [62] Consequently, the provisions of PHILEC\u2019s collective bargaining agreement with its supervisory employees should apply, not its collective bargaining agreement with PWU. [63] To insist on applying the pay grade scale in Article X, Section 4, PHILEC argues, would result in a salary distortion within PHILEC. [64]\n\nIn the resolution [65] dated September 21, 2005, this court ordered PWU to comment on PHILEC\u2019s petition for review on certiorari.\n\nIn its comment, [66] PWU argues that Voluntary Arbitrator Jimenez did not gravely abuse his discretion in rendering his decision. He correctly applied the provisions of the PWU collective bargaining agreement, the law between PHILEC and its rank-and-file employees, in computing Lipio\u2019s and Ignacio, Sr.\u2019s training allowance. [67]\n\nOn September 27, 2006, PHILEC filed its reply, [68] reiterating its arguments in its petition for review on certiorari.\n\nThe issue for our resolution is whether Voluntary Arbitrator Jimenez gravely abused his discretion in directing PHILEC to pay Lipio\u2019s and Ignacio, Sr.\u2019s training allowance based on Article X, Section 4 of the June 1, 1997 rank-and-file collective bargaining agreement.\n\nThis petition should be denied.\n\nI\n\nThe Voluntary Arbitrator\u2019s decision\ndated August 13, 1999 is already\nfinal and executory\n\nWe note that PHILEC filed before the Court of Appeals a petition for certiorari under Rule 65 of the Rules of Court against Voluntary Arbitrator Jimenez\u2019s decision. [69]\n\nThis was not the proper remedy.\n\nInstead, the proper remedy to reverse or modify a Voluntary Arbitrator\u2019s or a panel of Voluntary Arbitrators\u2019 decision or award is to appeal the award or decision before the Court of Appeals. Rule 43, Sections 1 and 3 of the Rules of Court provide:\n\nSection 1. Scope.\n\nThis Rule shall apply to appeals from judgments or final orders of the Court of Tax Appeals and from awards, judgments, final orders or resolutions of or authorized by any quasi-judicial agency in the exercise of its quasi-judicial functions. Among these agencies are the Civil Service Commission, Central Board of Assessment Appeals, Securities and Exchange Commission, Office of the President, Land Registration Authority, Social Security Commission, Civil Aeronautics Board, Bureau of Patents, Trademarks and Technology Transfer, National Electrification Administration, Energy Regulatory Board, National Telecommunications Commission, Department of Agrarian Reform under Republic Act No. 6657, Government Service Insurance System, Employees Compensation Commission, Agricultural Inventions Board, Insurance Commission, Philippine Atomic Energy Commission, Board of Investments, Construction Industry Arbitration Commission, and voluntary arbitrators authorized by law.\n\n. . . .\n\nSec. 3. Where to appeal.\n\nAn appeal under this Rule may be taken to the Court of Appeals within the period and in the manner herein provided, whether the appeal involves questions of fact, of law, or mixed questions of fact and law. (Emphasis supplied)\nA Voluntary Arbitrator or a panel of Voluntary Arbitrators has the exclusive original jurisdiction over grievances arising from the interpretation or implementation of collective bargaining agreements. Should the parties agree, a Voluntary Arbitrator or a panel of Voluntary Arbitrators shall also resolve the parties\u2019 other labor disputes, including unfair labor practices and bargaining deadlocks. Articles 261 and 262 of the Labor Code provide:\n\nART. 261. JURISDICTION OF VOLUNTARY ARBITRATORS OR PANEL OF VOLUNTARY ARBITRATORS.\n\nThe Voluntary Arbitrator or panel of Voluntary Arbitrators shall have original and exclusive jurisdiction to hear and decide all unresolved grievances arising from the interpretation or implementation of the Collective Bargaining Agreement and those arising from the interpretation or enforcement of company personnel policies referred to in the immediately preceding article. Accordingly, violations of a Collective Bargaining Agreement, except those which are gross in character, shall no longer be treated as unfair labor practice and shall be resolved as grievances under the Collective Bargaining Agreement. For purposes of this article, gross violations of Collective Bargaining Agreement shall mean flagrant and/or malicious refusal to comply with the economic provisions of such agreement.\n\nThe Commission, its Regional Offices and the Regional Directors of the Department of Labor and Employment shall not entertain disputes, grievances, or matters under the exclusive and original jurisdiction of the Voluntary Arbitrator or panel of Voluntary Arbitrators and shall immediately dispose and refer the same to the Grievance Machinery or Voluntary Arbitration provided in the Collective Bargaining Agreement.\n\nART. 262. JURISDICTION OVER OTHER LABOR DISPUTES.\n\nThe Voluntary Arbitrator or panel of Voluntary Arbitrators, upon agreement of the parties, shall also hear and decide all other labor disputes including unfair labor practices and bargaining deadlocks.\nIn Luzon Development Bank v. Association of Luzon Development Bank Employees , [70] this court ruled that the proper remedy against the award or decision of the Voluntary Arbitrator is an appeal before the Court of Appeals. This court first characterized the office of a Voluntary Arbitrator or a panel of Voluntary Arbitrators as a quasi-judicial agency, citing Volkschel Labor Union, et al. v. NLRC [71] and Oceanic Bic Division (FFW) v. Romero: [72]\n\nIn Volkschel Labor Union, et al. v. NLRC, et al., on the settled premise that the judgments of courts and awards of quasi-judicial agencies must become final at some definite time, this Court ruled that the awards of voluntary arbitrators determine the rights of parties; hence, their decisions have the same legal effect as judgments of a court. In Oceanic Bic Division (FFW), et al. v. Romero, et al., this Court ruled that \"a voluntary arbitrator by the nature of her functions acts in a quasi-judicial capacity.\" Under these rulings, it follows that the voluntary arbitrator, whether acting solely or in a panel, enjoys in law the status of a quasi-judicial agency but independent of, and apart from, the NLRC since his decisions are not appealable to the latter. [73] (Citations omitted)\nThis court then stated that the office of a Voluntary Arbitrator or a panel of Voluntary Arbitrators, even assuming that the office is not strictly a quasi-judicial agency, may be considered an instrumentality, thus:\n\nAssuming arguendo that the voluntary arbitrator or the panel of voluntary arbitrators may not strictly be considered as a quasi-judicial agency, board or commission, still both he and the panel are comprehended within the concept of a \"quasi-judicial instrumentality.\" It may even be stated that it was to meet the very situation presented by the quasi-judicial functions of the voluntary arbitrators here, as well as the subsequent arbitrator/arbitral tribunal operating under the Construction Industry Arbitration Commission, that the broader term \"instrumentalities\" was purposely included in the above-quoted provision.\n\nAn \"instrumentality\" is anything used as a means or agency. Thus, the terms governmental \"agency\" or \"instrumentality\" are synonymous in the sense that either of them is a means by which a government acts, or by which a certain government act or function is performed. The word \"instrumentality,\" with respect to a state, contemplates an authority to which the state delegates governmental power for the performance of a state function. An individual person, like an administrator or executor, is a judicial instrumentality in the settling of an estate, in the same manner that a sub-agent appointed by a bankruptcy court is an instrumentality of the court, and a trustee in bankruptcy of a defunct corporation is an instrumentality of the state.\n\nThe voluntary arbitrator no less performs a state function pursuant to a governmental power delegated to him under the provisions therefor in the Labor Code and he falls, therefore, within the contemplation of the term \"instrumentality\" in the aforequoted Sec. 9 of B.P. 129. [74] (Citations omitted)\nSince the office of a Voluntary Arbitrator or a panel of Voluntary Arbitrators is considered a quasi-judicial agency, this court concluded that a decision or award rendered by a Voluntary Arbitrator is appealable before the Court of Appeals. Under Section 9 of the Judiciary Reorganization Act of 1980, the Court of Appeals has the exclusive original jurisdiction over decisions or awards of quasi-judicial agencies and instrumentalities:\n\nSection 9. Jurisdiction. The Court of Appeals shall exercise:\n\n. . . .\n\n3. Exclusive appellate jurisdiction over all final judgements, resolutions, orders or awards of Regional Trial Courts and quasi-judicial agencies, instrumentalities , boards or commission, including the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Social Security Commission, the Employees Compensation Commission and the Civil Service Commission, except those falling within the appellate jurisdiction of the Supreme Court in accordance with the Constitution, the Labor Code of the Philippines under Presidential Decree No. 442, as amended, the provisions of this Act, and of subparagraph (1) of the third paragraph and subparagraph 4 of the fourth paragraph of Section 17 of the Judiciary Act of 1948. (Emphasis supplied)\nLuzon Development Bank was decided in 1995 but remains \u201cgood law.\u201d [75] In the 2002 case of Alcantara, Jr. v. Court of Appeals, [76] this court rejected petitioner Santiago Alcantara, Jr.\u2019s argument that the Rules of Court, specifically Rule 43, Section 2, superseded the Luzon Development Bank ruling:\n\nPetitioner argues, however, that Luzon Development Bank is no longer good law because of Section 2, Rule 43 of the Rules of Court, a new provision introduced by the 1997 revision. The provision reads:\nSEC. 2. Cases not covered. - This Rule shall not apply to judgments or final orders issued under the Labor Code of the Philippines. The provisions may be new to the Rules of Court but it is far from being a new law. Section 2, Rule 42 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure, as presently worded, is nothing more but a reiteration of the exception to the exclusive appellate jurisdiction of the Court of Appeals, as provided for in Section 9, Batas Pambansa Blg. 129,7 as amended by Republic Act No. 7902:8\n(3) Exclusive appellate jurisdiction over all final judgments, decisions, resolutions, orders or awards of Regional Trial Courts and quasi-judicial agencies, instrumentalities, boards or commissions, including the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Employees\u2019 Compensation Commission and the Civil Service Commission, except those falling within the appellate jurisdiction of the Supreme Court in accordance with the Constitution, t he Labor Code of the Philippines under Presidential Decree No. 442, as amended, the provisions of this Act and of subparagraph (1) of the third paragraph and subparagraph (4) of the fourth paragraph of Section 17 of the Judiciary Act of 1948. The Court took into account this exception in Luzon Development Bank but, nevertheless, held that the decisions of voluntary arbitrators issued pursuant to the Labor Code do not come within its ambit:\n\nx x x. The fact that [the voluntary arbitrator\u2019s] functions and powers are provided for in the Labor Code does not place him within the exceptions to said Sec. 9 since he is a quasi-judicial instrumentality as contemplated therein. It will be noted that, although the Employees\u2019 Compensation Commission is also provided for in the Labor Code, Circular No. 1-91, which is the forerunner of the present Revised Administrative Circular No. 1-95, laid down the procedure for the appealability of its decisions to the Court of Appeals under the foregoing rationalization, and this was later adopted by Republic Act No. 7902 in amending Sec. 9 of B.P. 129.\n\nA fortiori , the decision or award of the voluntary arbitrator or panel of arbitrators should likewise be appealable to the Court of Appeals, in line with the procedure outlined in Revised Administrative Circular No. 1-95, just like those of the quasi-judicial agencies, boards and commissions enumerated therein. [77] (Emphases in the original)\nThis court has since reiterated the Luzon Development Bank ruling in its decisions. [78]\n\nArticle 262-A of the Labor Code provides that the award or decision of the Voluntary Arbitrator \u201cshall be final and executory after ten (10) calendar days from receipt of the copy of the award or decision by the parties\u201d:\n\nArt. 262-A. PROCEDURES. The Voluntary Arbitrator or panel of Voluntary Arbitrators shall have the power to hold hearings, receive evidences and take whatever action is necessary to resolve the issue or issues subject of the dispute, including efforts to effect a voluntary settlement between parties.\n\nAll parties to the dispute shall be entitled to attend the arbitration proceedings. The attendance of any third party or the exclusion of any witness from the proceedings shall be determined by the Voluntary Arbitrator or panel of Voluntary Arbitrators. Hearing may be adjourned for cause or upon agreement by the parties.\n\nUnless the parties agree otherwise, it shall be mandatory for the Voluntary Arbitrator or panel of Voluntary Arbitrators to render an award or decision within twenty (20) calendar days from the date of submission of the dispute to voluntary arbitration.\n\nThe award or decision of the Voluntary Arbitrator or panel of Voluntary Arbitrators shall contain the facts and the law on which it is based. It shall be final and executory after ten (10) calendar days from receipt of the copy of the award or decision by the parties.\n\nUpon motion of any interested party, the Voluntary Arbitrator or panel of Voluntary Arbitrators or the Labor Arbiter in the region where the movant resides, in case of the absence or incapacity of the Voluntary Arbitrator or panel of Voluntary Arbitrators, for any reason, may issue a writ of execution requiring either the sheriff of the Commission or regular courts or any public official whom the parties may designate in the submission agreement to execute the final decision, order or award. (Emphasis supplied)\nThus, in Coca-Cola Bottlers Philippines, Inc. Sales Force Union-PTGWO-BALAIS v. Coca Cola-Bottlers Philippines, Inc., [79] this court declared that the decision of the Voluntary Arbitrator had become final and executory because it was appealed beyond the 10-day reglementary period under Article 262-A of the Labor Code.\n\nIt is true that Rule 43, Section 4 of the Rules of Court provides for a 15-day reglementary period for filing an appeal:\n\nSection 4. Period of appeal. \u2014 The appeal shall be taken within fifteen (15) days from notice of the award, judgment, final order or resolution, or from the date of its last publication, if publication is required by law for its effectivity, or of the denial of petitioner's motion for new trial or reconsideration duly filed in accordance with the governing law of the court or agency a quo . Only one (1) motion for reconsideration shall be allowed. Upon proper motion and the payment of the full amount of the docket fee before the expiration of the reglementary period, the Court of Appeals may grant an additional period of fifteen (15) days only within which to file the petition for review. No further extension shall be granted except for the most compelling reason and in no case to exceed fifteen (15) days. (Emphasis supplied)\nThe 15-day reglementary period has been upheld by this court in a long line of cases. [80] In AMA Computer College-Santiago City, Inc. v. Nacino , [81] Nippon Paint Employees Union-OLALIA v. Court of Appeals, [82] Manila Midtown Hotel v. Borromeo , [83] and Sevilla Trading Company v. Semana, [84] this court denied petitioners\u2019 petitions for review on certiorari since petitioners failed to appeal the Voluntary Arbitrator\u2019s decision within the 15-day reglementary period under Rule 43. In these cases, the Court of Appeals had no jurisdiction to entertain the appeal assailing the Voluntary Arbitrator\u2019s decision.\n\nDespite Rule 43 providing for a 15-day period to appeal, we rule that the Voluntary Arbitrator\u2019s decision must be appealed before the Court of Appeals within 10 calendar days from receipt of the decision as provided in the Labor Code.\n\nAppeal is a \u201cstatutory privilege,\u201d [85] which may be exercised \u201conly in the manner and in accordance with the provisions of the law.\u201d [86] \u201cPerfection of an appeal within the reglementary period is not only mandatory but also jurisdictional so that failure to do so rendered the decision final and executory, and deprives the appellate court of jurisdiction to alter the final judgment much less to entertain the appeal.\u201d [87]\n\nWe ruled that Article 262-A of the Labor Code allows the appeal of decisions rendered by Voluntary Arbitrators. [88] Statute provides that the Voluntary Arbitrator\u2019s decision \u201cshall be final and executory after ten (10) calendar days from receipt of the copy of the award or decision by the parties.\u201d Being provided in the statute, this 10-day period must be complied with; otherwise, no appellate court will have jurisdiction over the appeal. This absurd situation occurs when the decision is appealed on the 11th to 15th day from receipt as allowed under the Rules, but which decision, under the law, has already become final and executory.\n\nFurthermore, under Article VIII, Section 5(5) of the Constitution, this court \u201cshall not diminish, increase, or modify substantive rights\u201d in promulgating rules of procedure in courts. [89] The 10-day period to appeal under the Labor Code being a substantive right, this period cannot be diminished, increased, or modified through the Rules of Court. [90]\n\nIn Shioji v. Harvey, [91] this court held that the \u201crules of court, promulgated by authority of law, have the force and effect of law, if not in conflict with positive law.\u201d [92] Rules of Court are \u201csubordinate to the statute.\u201d [93] In case of conflict between the law and the Rules of Court, \u201cthe statute will prevail.\u201d [94]\n\nThe rule, therefore, is that a Voluntary Arbitrator\u2019s award or decision shall be appealed before the Court of Appeals within 10 days from receipt of the award or decision. Should the aggrieved party choose to file a motion for reconsideration with the Voluntary Arbitrator, [95] the motion must be filed within the same 10-day period since a motion for reconsideration is filed \u201cwithin the period for taking an appeal.\u201d [96]\n\nA petition for certiorari is a special civil action \u201cadopted to correct errors of jurisdiction committed by the lower court or quasi-judicial agency, or when there is grave abuse of discretion on the part of such court or agency amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction.\u201d [97] An extraordinary remedy, [98] a petition for certiorari may be filed only if appeal is not available. [99] If appeal is available, an appeal must be taken even if the ground relied upon is grave abuse of discretion. [100]\n\nAs an exception to the rule, this court has allowed petitions for certiorari to be filed in lieu of an appeal \u201c(a) when the public welfare and the advancement of public policy dictate; (b) when the broader interests of justice so require; (c) when the writs issued are null; and (d) when the questioned order amounts to an oppressive exercise of judicial authority.\u201d [101]\n\nIn Unicraft Industries International Corporation, et al. v. The Hon. Court of Appeals , [102] petitioners filed a petition for certiorari against the Voluntary Arbitrator\u2019s decision. Finding that the Voluntary Arbitrator rendered an award without giving petitioners an opportunity to present evidence, this court allowed petitioners\u2019 petition for certiorari despite being the wrong remedy. The Voluntary Arbitrator\u2019s award, this court said, was null and void for violation of petitioners\u2019 right to due process. This court decided the case on the merits.\n\nIn Leyte IV Electric Cooperative, Inc. v. LEYECO IV Employees Union-ALU, [103] petitioner likewise filed a petition for certiorari against the Voluntary Arbitrator\u2019s decision, alleging that the decision lacked basis in fact and in law. Ruling that the petition for certiorari was filed within the reglementary period for filing an appeal, this court allowed petitioner\u2019s petition for certiorari in \u201cthe broader interests of justice.\u201d [104]\n\nIn Mora v. Avesco Marketing Corporation , [105] this court held that petitioner Noel E. Mora erred in filing a petition for certiorari against the Voluntary Arbitrator\u2019s decision. Nevertheless, this court decided the case on the merits \u201cin the interest of substantial justice to arrive at the proper conclusion that is conformable to the evidentiary facts.\u201d [106]\n\nNone of the circumstances similar to Unicraft, Leyte IV Electric Cooperative, and Mora are present in this case. PHILEC received Voluntary Arbitrator Jimenez\u2019s resolution denying its motion for partial reconsideration on August 11, 2000. [107] PHILEC filed its petition for certiorari before the Court of Appeals on August 29, 2000, [108] which was 18 days after its receipt of Voluntary Arbitrator Jimenez\u2019s resolution. The petition for certiorari was filed beyond the 10-day reglementary period for filing an appeal. We cannot consider PHILEC\u2019s petition for certiorari as an appeal.\n\nThere being no appeal seasonably filed in this case, Voluntary Arbitrator Jimenez\u2019s decision became final and executory after 10 calendar days from PHILEC\u2019s receipt of the resolution denying its motion for partial reconsideration. [109] Voluntary Arbitrator Jimenez\u2019s decision is already \u201cbeyond the purview of this Court to act upon.\u201d [110]\n\nII\n\nPHILEC must pay training allowance\nbased on the step increases provided\nin the June 1, 1997 collective\nbargaining agreement\n\nThe insurmountable procedural issue notwithstanding, the case will also fail on its merits. Voluntary Arbitrator Jimenez correctly awarded both Lipio and Ignacio, Sr. training allowances based on the amounts and formula provided in the June 1, 1997 collective bargaining agreement.\n\nA collective bargaining agreement is \u201ca contract executed upon the request of either the employer or the exclusive bargaining representative of the employees incorporating the agreement reached after negotiations with respect to wages, hours of work and all other terms and conditions of employment, including proposals for adjusting any grievances or questions arising under such agreement.\u201d [111] A collective bargaining agreement being a contract, its provisions \u201cconstitute the law between the parties\u201d [112] and must be complied with in good faith. [113]\n\nPHILEC, as employer, and PWU, as the exclusive bargaining representative of PHILEC\u2019s rank-and-file employees, entered into a collective bargaining agreement, which the parties agreed to make effective from June 1, 1997 to May 31, 1999. Being the law between the parties, the June 1, 1997 collective bargaining agreement must govern PHILEC and its rank-and-file employees within the agreed period.\n\nLipio and Ignacio, Sr. were rank-and-file employees when PHILEC selected them for training for the position of Foreman I beginning August 25, 1997. Lipio and Ignacio, Sr. were selected for training during the effectivity of the June 1, 1997 rank-and-file collective bargaining agreement. Therefore, Lipio\u2019s and Ignacio, Sr.\u2019s training allowance must be computed based on Article X, Section 4 and Article IX, Section 1(f) of the June 1, 1997 collective bargaining agreement.\n\nContrary to PHILEC\u2019s claim, Lipio and Ignacio, Sr. were not transferred out of the bargaining unit when they were selected for training. Lipio and Ignacio, Sr. remained rank-and-file employees while they trained for the position of Foreman I. Under Article IX, Section 1(e) of the June 1, 1997 collective bargaining agreement, [114] a trainee who is \u201cunable to demonstrate his ability to perform the work . . . shall be reverted to his previous assignment. . . .\u201d [115] According to the same provision, the trainee \u201cshall hold that job on a trial or observation basis and . . . subject to prior approval of the authorized management official, be appointed to the position in a regular capacity.\u201d [116]\n\nThus, training is a condition precedent for promotion. Selection for training does not mean automatic transfer out of the bargaining unit of rank-and-file employees.\n\nMoreover, the June 1, 1997 collective bargaining agreement states that the training allowance of a rank-and-file employee \u201cwhose application for a posted job is accepted shall [be computed] in accordance with Section (f) of [Article IX].\u201d [117] Since Lipio and Ignacio, Sr. were rank-and-file employees when they applied for training for the position of Foreman I, Lipio\u2019s and Ignacio, Sr.\u2019s training allowance must be computed based on Article IX, Section 1(f) of the June 1, 1997 rank-and-file collective bargaining agreement.\n\nPHILEC allegedly applied the \u201cModified SGV\u201d pay grade scale to prevent any salary distortion within PHILEC\u2019s enterprise. This, however, does not justify PHILEC\u2019s non-compliance with the June 1, 1997 collective bargaining agreement. This pay grade scale is not provided in the collective bargaining agreement. In Samahang Manggagawa sa Top Form Manufacturing United Workers of the Philippines (SMTFM-UWP) v. NLRC , [118] this court ruled that \u201conly provisions embodied in the [collective bargaining agreement] should be so interpreted and complied with. Where a proposal raised by a contracting party does not find print in the [collective bargaining agreement], it is not part thereof and the proponent has no claim whatsoever to its implementation.\u201d [119]\n\nHad PHILEC wanted the \u201cModified SGV\u201d pay grade scale applied within its enterprise, \u201cit could have requested or demanded that [the \u2018Modified SGV\u2019 scale] be incorporated in the [collective bargaining agreement].\u201d [120] PHILEC had \u201cthe means under the law to compel [PWU] to incorporate this specific economic proposal in the [collective bargaining agreement].\u201d [121] It \u201ccould have invoked Article 252 of the Labor Code\u201d [122] to incorporate the \u201cModified SGV\u201d pay grade scale in its collective bargaining agreement with PWU. But it did not. Since this \u201cModified SGV\u201d pay grade scale does not appear in PHILEC\u2019s collective bargaining agreement with PWU, PHILEC cannot insist on the \u201cModified SGV\u201d pay grade scale\u2019s application. We reiterate Voluntary Arbitrator Jimenez\u2019s decision dated August 13, 1999 where he said that:\n\n. . . since the signing of the current CBA took place on September 27, 1997, PHILEC, by oversight, may have overlooked the possibility of a wage distortion occurring among ASSET-occupied positions. It is surmised that this matter could have been negotiated and settled with PWU before the actual signing of the CBA on September 27. Instead, PHILEC, again, allowed the provisions of Art. X, Sec. 4 of the CBA to remain the way it is and is now suffering the consequences of its laches. [123] (Emphasis in the original)\nWe note that PHILEC did not dispute PWU\u2019s contention that it selected several rank-and-file employees for training and paid them training allowance based on the schedule provided in the collective bargaining agreement effective at the time of the trainees\u2019 selection. [124] PHILEC cannot choose when and to whom to apply the provisions of its collective bargaining agreement. The provisions of a collective bargaining agreement must be applied uniformly and complied with in good faith.\n\nGiven the foregoing, Lipio\u2019s and Ignacio, Sr.\u2019s training allowance should be computed based on Article X, Section 4 in relation to Article IX, Section 1(f) of the June 1, 1997 rank-and-file collective bargaining agreement. Lipio, who held the position of Machinist before selection for training as Foreman I, should receive training allowance based on the following schedule:\n\n[TABLE_CONTENT]\nFirst Month | - - - - - | P456.00\nSecond Month | - - - - - | P1,031.00\nThird Month | - - - - - | P1,031.00\nFourth Month | - - - - - | P1,031.00\n[END_TABLE]\n\nFirst Month - - - - - P456.00 Second Month - - - - - P1,031.00 Third Month - - - - - P1,031.00 Fourth Month - - - - - P1,031.00\nIgnacio, Sr., who held the position of DT-Assembler before selection for training as Foreman I, should receive training allowance based on the following schedule:\n\n[TABLE_CONTENT]\nFirst Month | - - - - - | P361.00\nSecond Month | - - - - - | P817.00\nThird Month | - - - - - | P1,392.00\nFourth Month | - - - - - | P1,392.00\n[END_TABLE]\n\nFirst Month - - - - - P361.00 Second Month - - - - - P817.00 Third Month - - - - - P1,392.00 Fourth Month - - - - - P1,392.00\nConsidering that Voluntary Arbitrator Jimenez\u2019s decision awarded sums of money, Lipio and Ignacio, Sr. are entitled to legal interest on their training allowances. Voluntary Arbitrator Jimenez\u2019s decision having become final and executory on August 22, 2000, PHILEC is liable for legal interest equal to 12% per annum from finality of the decision until full payment as this court ruled in Eastern Shipping Lines, Inc. v. Court of Appeals : [125]\n\nWhen the judgment of the court awarding a sum of money becomes final and executory, the rate of legal interest. . . shall be 12% per annum from such finality until its satisfaction, this interim period being deemed to be by then as equivalent to a forbearance of credit. [126]\n\nThe 6% legal interest under Circular No. 799, Series of 2013, of the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas Monetary Board shall not apply, Voluntary Arbitrator Jimenez\u2019s decision having become final and executory prior to the effectivity of the circular on July 1, 2013. In Nacar v. Gallery Frames, [127] we held that:\n\n. . . with regard to those judgments that have become final and executory prior to July 1, 2013, said judgments shall not be disturbed and shall continue to be implemented applying the rate of interest fixed therein. [128]\nWHEREFORE , the petition for review on certiorari is DENIED . The Court of Appeals\u2019 decision dated May 25, 2004 is AFFIRMED.\n\nPetitioner Philippine Electric Corporation is ORDERED to PAY respondent Eleodoro V. Lipio a total of P3,549.00 for a four (4)-month training for the position of Foreman I with legal interest of 12% per annum from August 22, 2000 until the amount\u2019s full satisfaction.\n\nFor respondent Emerlito C. Ignacio, Sr., Philippine Electric Corporation is ORDERED to PAY a total of P3,962.00 for a four (4)-month training for the position of Foreman I with legal interest of 12% per annum from August 22, 2000 until the amount\u2019s full satisfaction.\n\nSO ORDERED.\n\nCarpio, (Chairperson), Del Castillo, Villarama, Jr ., * and Mendoza, JJ., concur.\n\n* Designated acting member per Special Order No. 1888 dated November 28, 2014.\n\n[1] Rollo , pp. 9\u201329.\n\n[2] Id. at 32\u201340.

JUDGE MEINRADO P. PAREDES, RESPONDENT.D E C I S I O N\nJILL M. TORMIS, COMPLAINANT, VS. JUDGE MEINRADO P. PAREDES, RESPONDENT.\n\nD E C I S I O N\n\nMENDOZA, J.:\n\nFor consideration is the Report and Recommendation [1] of Justice Maria Elisa Sempio Diy (Justice Diy) , Court of Appeals, Cebu City, submitted to this Court pursuant to its January 14, 2013 Resolution, [2] referring the complaint filed by Jill M. Tormis (Jill) against respondent Judge Meinrado P. Paredes (Judge Paredes), Presiding Judge, Branch 13, Regional Trial Court (RTC) , Cebu City, for investigation, report and recommendation.\n\nThe Facts\n\nIn her Affidavit/Complaint, [3] dated September 5, 2011, Jill charged Judge Paredes with grave misconduct.\u00a0 Jill was a student of Judge Paredes in Political Law Review during the first semester of school year 2010-2011 at the Southwestern University, Cebu City.\u00a0 She averred that sometime in August 2010, in his class discussions, Judge Paredes named her mother, Judge Rosabella Tormis (Judge Tormis) , then Presiding Judge of Branch 4, Municipal Trial Court in Cities (MTCC) , Cebu City, as one of the judges involved in the marriage scams in Cebu City.\u00a0 Judge Paredes also mentioned in his class that Judge Tormis was abusive of her position as a judge, corrupt, and ignorant of the law.\n\nJill added that Judge Paredes included Judge Tormis in his discussions not only once but several times. In one session, Judge Paredes was even said to have included in his discussion Francis Mondragon Tormis (Francis) , son of Judge Tormis, stating that he was a \u201ccourt-noted addict.\u201d [4] She was absent from class at that time, but one of her classmates who was present, Rhoda L. Litang (Rhoda) , informed her about the inclusion of her brother.\u00a0 To avoid humiliation in school, Jill decided to drop the class under Judge Paredes and transfer to another law school in Tacloban City.\n\nJill also disclosed that in the case entitled \u201c Trinidad O. Lachica v. Judge Tormis \u201d [5] (Lachica v. Tormis) , her mother was suspended from the service for six (6) months for allegedly receiving payment of a cash bail bond for the temporary release of an accused for the warrant she had issued in a case then pending before her sala.\u00a0 Judge Paredes was the one who reviewed the findings conducted therein and he recommended that the penalty be reduced to severe reprimand.\n\nJill, however, claimed that Judge Paredes committed an offense worse than that committed by her mother.\u00a0 She averred that on March 13, 2011, Judge Paredes accepted a cash bail bond in the amount of Six Thousand Pesos (P6,000.00) for the temporary release of one Lita Guioguio in a case entitled, \u201c People of the Philippines v. Lita Guioguio ,\u201d docketed as Criminal Case No. 148434-R, [6] then pending before Branch 8, MTCC, Cebu City ( Guioguio case ).\n\nThus, she prayed that Judge Paredes be administratively sanctioned for his actuations.\n\nComment of Judge Paredes\n\nIn his Comment, [7] dated October 28, 2011, Judge Paredes denied the accusations of\u00a0 Jill.\u00a0 He stated that Judge Tormis had several administrative cases, some of which he had investigated; that as a result of the investigations, he recommended sanctions against Judge Tormis; that Judge Tormis used Jill, her daughter, to get back at him; that he discussed in his class the case of Lachica v. Tormis , but never Judge Tormis\u2019 involvement in the marriage scams nor her sanctions as a result of the investigation conducted by the Court; that he never personally attacked Judge Tormis\u2019 dignity and credibility; that the marriage scams in Cebu City constituted a negative experience for all the judges and should be discussed so that other judges, court employees and aspiring lawyers would not emulate such misdeeds; that the marriage scams were also discussed during meetings of RTC judges and in schools where remedial law and legal ethics were taught; that he talked about past and resolved cases, but not the negative tendencies of Judge Tormis; that there was nothing wrong in discussing the administrative cases involving Judge Tormis because these cases were known to the legal community and some were even published in the Supreme Court Reports Annotated (SCRA) and other legal publications; and that when he was the executive judge tasked to investigate Judge Tormis, he told her to mend her ways, but she resented his advice.\n\nJudge Paredes further stated that when Jill was still his student, she did not complain about or dispute his discussions in class regarding the administrative liabilities of her mother; that the matter was not also brought to the attention of the Dean of Southwestern University or of the local authorities; that he admitted saying that Judge Tormis had a son named Francis who was a drug addict and that drug dependents had no place in the judiciary; and that he suggested that Francis should be removed from the judiciary.\n\nHe denied, however, having stated that Francis was appointed as court employee as a result of the influence of Judge Tormis.\u00a0 She is not an influential person and it is the Supreme Court who determines the persons to be appointed as court employees.\u00a0 Judge Tormis, however, allowed her drug dependent son to apply for a position in the judiciary.\n\nRegarding the specific act being complained of, Judge Paredes admitted that he personally accepted a cash bail bond of P6,000.00 for the temporary release of Lita Guioguio on March 13, 2011.\u00a0 He claimed though that the approval of the bail bond was in accordance with Section 14, Chapter 5 of A.M. No. 03-8-62-SC which allowed executive judges to act on petitions for bail and other urgent matters on weekends, official holidays and special days.\u00a0 Judge Paredes explained that he merely followed the procedure.\u00a0 As Executive Judge, he issued a temporary receipt and on the following business day, a Monday, he instructed the Branch Clerk of Court to remit the cash bond to the Clerk of Court.\u00a0 The Clerk of Court acknowledged the receipt of the cash bond and issued an official receipt.\u00a0 It was not his fault that the Clerk of Court acknowledged the receipt of the cash bond only in the afternoon of March 21, 2011.\n\nLastly, Judge Paredes averred that the discussions relative to the administrative cases of Judge Tormis could not be the subject of an administrative complaint because it was not done in the performance of his judicial duties.\n\nReply of the Complainant\n\nIn her Verified-Reply, [8] dated November 23, 2011, Jill countered that her mother had nothing to do with the filing of the present complaint; that she was forced to leave her family in Cebu City to continue her law studies elsewhere because she could no longer bear the discriminating and judgmental eyes of her classmates brought about by Judge Paredes\u2019 frequent discussions in class of her mother\u2019s administrative cases; that her mother was indeed one of the judges implicated in the marriage scams, but when Judge Paredes discussed the matter in his classes, the case of her mother was not yet resolved by the Court and, thus, in 2010, it was still premature; and that Judge Paredes was aware that administrative cases were confidential in nature.\n\nJill claimed that the intention to humiliate her family was evident when Judge Paredes branded her brother, Francis, as a \u201cdrug addict.\u201d\n\nRejoinder of Judge Paredes\n\nIn his Rejoinder, [9] dated December 2, 2011, Judge Paredes asserted that it was not premature to discuss the marriage scams in class because the scandal was already disclosed by Atty. Rullyn Garcia and was also written in many legal publications, and that the drug addiction of Francis was known in the Palace of Justice of Cebu City.\n\nIn its Report, [10] dated September 12, 2012, the Office of the Court Administrator (OCA) stated that the conflicting allegations by the parties presented factual issues that could not be resolved based on the evidence on record then.\u00a0 Considering the gravity and the sensitive nature of the charges, a full-blown investigation should be conducted by the CA.\n\nOn January 14, 2013, pursuant to the recommendation of the OCA, the Court referred the administrative complaint to the Executive Justice of the CA, Cebu Station, for investigation, report and recommendation within sixty (60) days from receipt of the records. [11]\n\nOn March 26, 2013, the case was raffled to, and the records were received by, Justice Diy.\u00a0 Thereafter, the appropriate notices were issued and the confidential hearings were conducted.\u00a0 Afterwards, Justice Diy received the respective memoranda of the parties.\n\nIn her memorandum, [12] Jill contended that Judge Paredes\u2019 act of discussing Judge Tormis\u2019 cases in class where she was present was an open display of insensitivity, impropriety and lack of delicadeza bordering on oppressive and abusive conduct, which fell short of the exacting standards of behavior demanded of magistrates.\u00a0 She asserted that the defense of Judge Paredes that he could not be made administratively liable as the act was not made in the performance of his official duties did not hold water because a judge should be the embodiment of what was just and fair not only in the performance of his official duties but also in his everyday life.\n\nJill also averred that Judge Paredes violated the subjudice rule when he discussed the marriage scam involving Judge Tormis in 2010 because at that time, the case was still being investigated; that the administrative case relative to the marriage scam was decided only on April 2, 2013; that Judge Paredes was not the Executive Judge of the MTCC when he received the cash bail bond in the Guiguio case; that he could not prove that the executive judge of the MTCC was unavailable before accepting the cash bail bond; and that the assertion of Judge Paredes of his being an anti-corruption judge and a lone nominee of the IBP Cebu City Chapter to the Foundation of Judicial Excellence did not exculpate him from committing the acts complained of.\n\nIn his Reply-Memorandum, [13] Judge Paredes reiterated the allegations contained in his previous pleadings.\u00a0 He added that the marriage scams scandalized the Judiciary and became public knowledge when Atty. Rullyn Garcia of the OCA held a press conference on the matter; that, hence, every citizen, including him, may comment thereon; that in the hierarchy of rights, freedom of speech and expression ranked high; that Judge Tormis never intervened in the present case; that if he indeed made derogatory remarks against Judge Tormis, she should have filed a criminal action for oral defamation; and that calling for the ouster of drug addicts could not be considered an abuse, but was meant for the protection of the Judiciary. [14]\n\nIn her Report and Recommendation, Justice Diy found Judge Paredes guilty of conduct unbecoming of a judge.\u00a0 She opined that his use of intemperate language during class discussions was inappropriate.\u00a0 His statements in class, tending to project Judge Tormis as corrupt and ignorant of the laws and procedure, were obviously and clearly insensitive and inexcusable.\n\nJustice Diy disregarded the defense of Judge Paredes that his discussions of the administrative case of Judge Tormis in class was an exercise of his right to freedom of expression.\u00a0 She cited the New Code of Judicial Conduct for the Philippine Judiciary [15] which urged members of the Judiciary to be models of propriety at all times.\u00a0 She quoted with emphasis Section 6 which stated that \u201c Judges, like any other citizen, are entitled to freedom of expression, belief, association and assembly, but in exercising such rights, they shall always conduct themselves in such a manner as to preserve the dignity of the judicial office and the impartiality and independence of the judiciary. \u201d [16]\n\nJustice Diy likewise rejected Judge Paredes\u2019 position that he could not be held administratively liable for his comments against Judge Tormis and Francis as these were uttered while he was not in the exercise of his judicial functions.\u00a0 Jurisprudence, [17] as well as the New Code of Judicial Conduct, required that he conduct himself beyond reproach, not only in the discharge of his judicial functions, but also in his other professional endeavors and everyday activities.\n\nJustice Diy found merit in Jill\u2019s allegation that Judge Paredes violated the subjudice rule when the latter discussed the marriage scams involving Judge Tormis in 2010 when the said issue was still being investigated.\u00a0 She cited, as basis for Judge Paredes\u2019 liability, Section 4, Canon 3 of the New Code of Judicial Conduct.\n\nAs regards Judge Paredes\u2019 receipt of the cash bail bond in relation to the Guioguio case, Justice Diy absolved him of any liability as the charge of grave misconduct was not supported by sufficient evidence.\u00a0 She accepted Judge Paredes\u2019 explanation that he merely followed the procedure laid down in Section 14, Chapter 5 of A.M. No. 03-8-02-SC when he approved the bail bond.\n\nBased on these findings, Justice Diy came up with the following recommendations, thus:\n\nThe undersigned Investigating Justice finds that indeed Judge Paredes is guilty of conduct unbecoming of a judge.\u00a0 Conduct unbecoming of a judge is classified as a light offense under Section 10, Rule 140 of the Revised Rules of Court, penalized under Section 11 (c) thereof by any of the following: (1) a Fine of not less than P1,000.00 but not exceeding P10,000.00; (2) Censure; (3) Reprimand; and (4) Admonition with warning.\n\nInasmuch as this is Judge Paredes\u2019 first offense and considering the factual milieu and the peculiar circumstances attendant thereto, it is respectfully recommended that Judge Paredes be meted out with the penalty of REPRIMAND with a warning that a repetition of the same or a similar offense will be dealt with more severely. [18]\n\nThe Court\u2019s Ruling\n\nThe Court adopts the findings and recommendations of Justice Diy except as to the penalty.\n\nMisconduct is defined as a transgression of some established and definite rule of action, more particularly, unlawful behavior or gross negligence by a public officer.\u00a0 The misconduct is grave if it involves any of the additional elements of corruption, willful intent to violate the law, or to disregard established rules, which must be established by substantial evidence. As distinguished from simple misconduct, the elements of corruption, clear intent to violate the law, or flagrant disregard of established rule, must be manifest in a charge of grave misconduct. Corruption, as an element of grave misconduct, consists in the act of an official or fiduciary person who unlawfully and wrongfully uses his station or character to procure some benefit for himself or for another person, contrary to duty and the rights of others. [19]\n\nTo constitute misconduct, the act or acts must have a direct relation to and be connected with the performance of his official duties. [20] Considering that the acts complained of, the remarks against Judge Tormis and Francis, were made by Judge Paredes in his class discussions, they cannot be considered as \u201cmisconduct.\u201d\u00a0 They are simply not related to the discharge of his official functions as a judge.\u00a0 Thus, Judge Paredes cannot be held liable for misconduct, much less for grave misconduct.\n\nDiscussion of a subjudice matter , however, is another thing.\n\nOn subjudice matters, Section 4, Canon 3 of the New Code of Judicial Conduct provides:\n\nCANON 3\n\nIMPARTIALITY\n\nSEC. 4.\u00a0 Judges shall not knowingly, while a proceeding is before or could come before them, make any comment that might reasonably be expected to affect the outcome of such proceeding or impair the manifest fairness of the process. Nor shall judges make any comment in public or otherwise that might affect the fair trial of any person or issue. (Emphasis supplied)\n\nThe subjudice rule restricts comments and disclosures pertaining to the judicial proceedings in order to avoid prejudging the issue, influencing the court, or obstructing the administration of justice. [21] The rationale for the rule was spelled out in Nestle Philippines, Inc. v. Sanchez , [22] where it was stated that it is a traditional conviction of civilized society everywhere that courts and juries, in the decision of issues of fact and law should be immune from every extraneous influence; that facts should be decided upon evidence produced in court; and that the determination of such facts should be uninfluenced by bias, prejudice or sympathies. [23]\n\nNotably, when Judge Paredes discussed the marriage scams involving Judge Tormis in 2010, the investigation relative to the said case had not yet been concluded.\u00a0 In fact, the decision on the case was promulgated by the Court only on April 2, 2013. [24] In 2010, he still could not make comments on the administrative case to prevent any undue influence in its resolution.\u00a0 Commenting on the marriage scams, where Judge Tormis was one of the judges involved, was in contravention of the subjudice rule.\u00a0 Justice Diy was, therefore, correct in finding that Judge Paredes violated Section 4, Canon 3 of the New Code of Judicial Conduct.\n\nThe Court shares the view of Justice Diy that although the reasons of Judge Paredes for discussing the marriage scams in his classes seemed noble, his objectives were carried out insensitively and in bad taste.\u00a0 The pendency of the administrative case of Judge Tormis and the publicity of the marriage scams did not give Judge Paredes unrestrained license to criticize Judge Tormis in his class discussions.\u00a0 The publicity given to the investigation of the said scams and the fact that it was widely discussed in legal circles let people expressed critical opinions on the issue.\u00a0 There was no need for Judge Paredes to \u201crub salt to the wound,\u201d [25] as Justice Diy put it.\n\nJudge Paredes in using intemperate language and unnecessary comments tending to project Judge Tormis as a corrupt and ignorant judge in his class discussions, was correctly found guilty of conduct unbecoming of a judge by Justice Dy.\n\nIndeed, the New Code of Judicial Conduct for the Philippine Judiciary requires judges to exemplify propriety at all times.\u00a0 Canon 4 instructs:\n\nCANON 4\n\nPROPRIETY\n\nSEC. 1.\u00a0 Judges shall avoid impropriety and the appearance of impropriety in all of their activities.\n\nxxx\n\nSEC. 2.\u00a0 As a subject of constant public scrutiny, judges must accept personal restrictions that might be viewed as burdensome by the ordinary citizen and should do so freely and willingly. In particular, judges shall conduct themselves in a way that is consistent with the dignity of the judicial office.\nA judge should always conduct himself in a manner that would preserve the dignity, independence and respect for himself, the Court and the Judiciary as a whole.\u00a0 He must exhibit the hallmark judicial temperament of utmost sobriety and self-restraint.\u00a0 He should choose his words and exercise more caution and control in expressing himself.\u00a0 In other words, a judge should possess the virtue of gravitas.\u00a0 Furthermore, a magistrate should not descend to the level of a sharp-tongued, ill-mannered petty tyrant by uttering harsh words, snide remarks and sarcastic comments.\u00a0 He is required to always be temperate, patient and courteous, both in conduct and in language. [26]\n\nIn this case, records show that Judge Paredes failed to observe the propriety required by the Code and to use temperate and courteous language befitting a magistrate.\u00a0 Indeed, Judge Paredes demonstrated conduct unbecoming of a judge.\n\nWhen Judge Paredes failed to restrain himself and included Francis, whose condition and personal circumstances, as properly observed by Justice Diy, had no relevance to the topic that was then being discussed in class, it strongly indicated his intention to taint their reputations.\n\nThe inclusion of Judge Tormis and Francis in his class discussions was never denied by Judge Paredes who merely justified his action by invoking his right to freedom of expression.\u00a0 Section 6, Canon 4 of the New Code of Judicial Conduct recognizes that judges, like any other citizen, are entitled to freedom of expression.\u00a0 Such right, however, is not without limitation.\u00a0 Section 6, Canon 4 of the Code also imposes a correlative restriction on judges: in the exercise of their freedom of expression, they should always conduct themselves in a manner that preserves the dignity of the judicial office and the impartiality and independence of the Judiciary.\u00a0 In the exercise of his right to freedom of expression, Judge Paredes should uphold the good image of the Judiciary of which he is a part.\u00a0 He should have avoided unnecessary and uncalled for remarks in his discussions and should have been more circumspect in his language.\u00a0 Being a judge, he is expected to act with greater circumspection and to speak with self-restraint.\u00a0 Verily, Judge Paredes fell short of this standard.\n\nThe Court cannot sustain the assertion of Judge Paredes that he cannot be held administratively liable for his negative portrayal of Judge Tormis and Francis in his class discussions.\u00a0 Judge Paredes should be reminded of the ethical conduct expected of him as a judge not only in the performance of his judicial duties, but in his professional and private activities as well.\u00a0 Sections 1 and 2, Canon 2 of the Code mandates:\n\nCANON 2\n\nINTEGRITY\n\nIntegrity is essential not only to the proper discharge of the judicial office but also to the personal demeanor of judges.\n\nSECTION 1.\u00a0 Judges shall ensure that not only is their conduct above reproach, but that it is perceived to be so in the view of a reasonable observer.\n\nSECTION 2.\u00a0 The behavior and conduct of judges must reaffirm the people\u2019s faith in the integrity of the judiciary.\u00a0 Justice must not merely be done but must also be seen to be done.\n(Emphases supplied)\n\nAny impropriety on the part of Judge Paredes, whether committed in or out of the court, should not be tolerated for he is not a judge only occasionally.\u00a0 It should be emphasized that the Code of Judicial Ethics mandates that the conduct of a judge must be free of a whiff of impropriety not only with respect to his performance of his judicial duties, but also to his behavior outside his sala and as a private individual.\u00a0 There is no dichotomy of morality, a public official is also judged by his private morals.\u00a0 The Code dictates that a judge, in order to promote public confidence in the integrity and impartiality of the judiciary, must behave with propriety at all times.\u00a0 A judge\u2019s official life cannot simply be detached or separated from his personal existence.\u00a0 Thus, being a subject of constant public scrutiny, a judge should freely and willingly accept restrictions on conduct that might be viewed as burdensome by the ordinary citizen.\u00a0 He should personify judicial integrity and exemplify honest public service.\u00a0 The personal behavior of a judge, both in the performance of official duties and in private life should be above suspicion. [27]\n\nRegarding the act of receiving the cash bail bond in the Guioguio case , Justice Diy correctly found that it cannot be regarded as grave misconduct.\u00a0 The Court finds merit in the position of Judge Paredes that the approval, as well as the receipt, of the cash bail bond, was in accordance with the rules.\u00a0 Thus:\n\nFinally, the Investigating Officer disagrees with Jill\u2019s allegation that Judge Paredes committed grave misconduct when he personally received cash bail bond in relation to the Guioguio case. Judge Paredes justified his action by stating that he was merely following the procedure set forth in Section 14, Chapter 5 of A.M. No. 03-02-SC, which authorizes executive judges to act on petitions for bail on Saturdays after 1:00 o\u2019clock in the afternoon, Sundays, official holidays, and special days.\u00a0 Said rule also provides that should the accused deposit cash bail, the executive judge shall acknowledge receipt of the cash bail bond in writing and issue a temporary receipt therefor.\u00a0 Considering that Judge Paredes merely followed said procedure, he cannot be held administratively liable for his act of receiving the cash bail bond in the Guioguio case.\n\nMoreover, respondent judge is authorized to receive the cash bail bond under Section 17 (a), Rule 114 of the Revised Rules on Criminal Procedure.\u00a0 Under said provision, the bail bond may be filed either with the court where the case is pending, or with any Regional Trial Court (RTC) of the place of arrest, or with any judge of the Metropolitan Trial Court or the Municipal Trial Court of the place of arrest.\n\nLastly, Section 1 (h), Chapter 4 of A.M. No. 03-8-02-SC provides that executive judges are authorized to exercise other powers and prerogatives which are necessary or incidental to the performance of their functions in relation to court administration.\u00a0 In the instant case, Judge Paredes was merely exercising powers incidental to his functions as an Executive Judge since he was the only judge available when Lita Guioguio posted bail.\u00a0 Notably, Lita Guioguio\u2019s payment for cash bail bond was made on a Sunday.\u00a0 In addition, the judge assigned to the court where the Guioguio case was then pending and the executive judge of the MTCC, Cebu City were not available to receive the bail bond.\u00a0 Judge Paredes was the only judge available since the practice was for one judge to be present on Saturdays.\u00a0 However, there was no judge assigned for duty during Sundays.\n\nRelative to the matter above-discussed, the insinuation made by complainant Jill of any irregularity reflected in the issuance of the two (2) orders of release of different dates is not backed up by sufficient evidence. [28]\nConduct unbecoming of a judge is classified as a light offense under Section 10, Rule 140 of the Rules of Court and penalized under Section 11(C) thereof by any of the following: (1) A fine of not less than P1,000.00 but not exceeding P10,000.00; (2) Censure; (3) Reprimand; and (4) Admonition with warning.\n\nConsidering that this is the first offense of Judge Paredes, the appropriate penalty under the circumstances is admonition.\n\nWHEREFORE , the Court finds Judge Meinrado P. Paredes, Presiding Judge of Branch 13 of the Regional Trial Court of Cebu City, administratively liable for conduct unbecoming of a judge and ADMONISHES him therefor.\n\nSO ORDERED.\n\nCarpio, (Chairperson), Velasco, Jr., * Del Castillo, , and Leonen, JJ. , concur.\n\n* Designated Acting member in lieu of Associate Justice Arturo D.

No. 9700.[18] As amended by R.A. No. 7881[19] Rollo, p. 1 0.[20] G.R. No. 139083, August 30, 2001, 364 SCRA 110.[21] Id. at 118.DISSENTING OPINION LEONEN, J.:I dissent on two points. First, the Office of the President's February 16, 2011 Decision[1] is already final and executory. This court, therefore, may no longer review the Decision.Second, the property in this case is covered by a homestead patent. Thus, it is exempt from agrarian reform coverage. The heirs of the original homesteader must be given the chance to cultivate their land.IThis court may no longer review the final and executory Decision of theOffice of the PresidentUnder Rule 43 of the Rules of Court, decisions of the Office of the President are appealed before the Court of Appeals through a Petition for Review raising questions of fact, of law, or mixed questions of fact and law.[2] The Appeal must be filed within 15 days from notice of the\u00b7 decision or resolution denying the Motion for Reconsideration as provided in Rule 43, Sections 1 and 4:Section 1. Scope. - This Rule shall apply to appeals from judgments or final orders of the Court of Tax Appeals and from awards, judgments, final orders or resolutions of or authorized by any quasi\u00ad judicial agency in the exercise of its quasi-judicial functions. Among these agencies are the Civil Service Commission, Central Board of Assessment Appeals, Securities and Exchange Commission, Office of the President, Land Registration Authority, Social Security Commission, Civil Aeronautics Board, Bureau of Patents, Trademarks and Technology Transfer, National Electrification Administration, Energy Regulatory Board, National Telecommunications .Commission, Department of Agrarian Reform under Republic Act No. 6657, Government Service Insurance System, Employees Compensation Commission, Agricultural Inventions Board, Insurance Commission, Philippine Atomic Energy Commission, Board of Investments, Construction Industry Arbitration Commission, and voluntary arbitrators authorized by law.Sec. 4. Period of appeal. The appeal shall be taken within fifteen (15) days from notice of the award, judgment, final order or resolution, or from the date of its last publication, if publication is required by law for its effectivity, or of the denial of petitioner's motion for new trial or reconsideration duly filed in accordance with the governing law of the court or agency a quo. Only one (1) motion for reconsideration s,hall be allowed. Upon proper motion and the payment of the full amount of the docket fee before the expiration of the reglementary period, the Court of Appeals may grant an additional period of fifteen (15) days only within which to file the petition for review. No further extension shall be granted except for the most compelling reason and in no case to exceed fifteen (15) days.Petitioners Danilo Almero, Teresita Alagon, Celia Bulaso, Ludy Ramada, Regina Gegremosa, Isidro Lazarte, Thelma Embarque, Felipe Lazarte, Guilerma Lazarte, and Dulcesima Benimele (Almero, et al.) availed themselves of the wrong remedy against the Office of the President's Decision. Instead of directly appealing before this court, Almero, et al. should have filed a Petition for Review before the Court of Appeals under Rule 43.It is 'true that a Petition for Rev ew on Certiorari may be directly filed before thiscourt ifthe Petition raises pure questions oflaw.[3] However, even assuming that Almero, et al.'s Petition raises pure questions of law, this court should have dismissed outright Almero, et al.'s Petition for having been filed out of time. Under Rule 45, Section 2 of the Rules of Court, a Petition for Review on Certiorari must be filed within 15 days from notice of the assailed Decision or Resolution:Sec. 2. Time for filing; extension. The petition shall be filed within fifteen (15) days from notice of the judgment or final order or resolution appealed from, or of the denial of the petitioner's motion for new trial or reconsideration filed in due time after notice of the judgment. On motion duly filed and served, with full payment of the docket and other lawful fees and the deposit for costs before the expiration of the reglementary period, the Supreme Court may for justifiable reasons grant an extension of thirty (30) days only within which to file the petition.Almero, et al. had notice of the Office of the President's Resolution denying their Motion for Reconsideration on September 29, 2011. Thus, Almero, et al. had until October 14, 2011 to file their Appeal. Yet, Almero, et al. appealed before this court only on November 14, 2011, which was beyond 15 days from their notice of the Resolution denying their Motion for Reconsideration. Their filing of the Petition, therefore, did not toll the reglementary period for filing an appeal. The Decision of the Office of the President has become final and executory as of October 15, 2011, and this court may no longer review the Decision.IIThe property is exempt from coverage of the Comprehensive AgrarianReform ProgramAgrarian reform is the \"redistribution of lands, regardless of crops or fruits produced, to farmers and regular farmworkers who are landless.\"[4] It includes not only the physical redistribution of lands but also other alternative arrangements, such as production or profit-sharing, labor administration, and the redistribution of shares of stock all aimed to lift the economic status of the property's farmer-beneficiaries.[5]As a general rule, all agricultural lands, whether public or private, are covered by the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Program.[6] An agricultural land refers to land devoted to any of the following agricultural activities: cultivation of the soil, planting of crops, growing of fruit trees, raising of livestock, poultry or fish, including the harvesting of such farm products, and other farm activities and practices performed by a farmer in conjunction with such farming operations done by persons whether natural or juridical.[7] Section 4 of the Comprehensive Agrarian. Reform Law enumerates properties covered by the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Program:SEC. 4. Scope. The Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Law of 1988 shall cover, regardless of tenurial arrangement and commodity produced, all public and private agricultural lands as provided in Proclamation No. 131 and Executive Order No. 229, including other lands of tho public domain suitable for agriculture.More specifically, the following lands are covered by the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Program:All alienable and disposable lands of the public domain devoted to or suitable for agriculture. No reclassification of forest or mineral lands to agricultural lands shall be undertaken after the approval of this Act until Congress, taking into account ecological, developmental and equity considerations, shall have determined by law, the specific limits of the public domain;All lands of the public domain in excess of the specific limits as determined by Congress in the preceding paragraph; All other lands owned by the Government devoted to or suitable for agriculture; andAll private lands devoted to or suitable for agriculture regardless of the agricultural products raised or that 'can be raised thereon.As for the properties exempt from agrarian reform coverage, Section 10 of the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Law provides:SEC. 10. Exemptions and Exclusions. Lands actually, directly and exclusively used and found to be necessary for parks, wildlife, forest reserves, reforestation, fish sanctuaries and breeding grounds, watersheds and mangroves, national defense, school sites and campuses including experimental farm stations operated by public or private schools for educational purposes, seeds and seedlings research and pilot production centers, church sites and convents appurtenant thereto, mosque sites and Islamic centers appurtenant thereto, communal burial grounds and cemeteries, penal colonies and penal farms actually worked by the inmates, government and private research and quarantine centers and all lands with eighteen percent (18%) slope and over, except those already developed shall be exempt from the coverage of this Act.In the present case, the majority ruled that the property of the Heirs of Manuel Pacquing is covered by the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Program, the property being an agricultural land.I disagree with the majority. The property in this case is exempt from agrarian reform, having been granted to Manuel Pacquing through a homestead patent.Although a social justice measure,[8] agrarian reform is subject to limitations. Under Article XIII, Section 6 of the Constitution, distribution of lands through agrarian reform is \"subject to prior rights, homestead rights of small settlers, and the rights of indigenous cultural communities to their ancestral lands\":Section 6. The State shall apply the principles of agrarian reform or stewardship, whenever applicable in accordance with law, in the disposition or utilization of other natural resources, including land of the public domain under lease or concession suitable to agriculture, subject to prior rights, homestead rights of small settlers, and the rights of indigenous cultural communities to their ancestral lands. (Emphasis supplied)Chapter IV of Commonwealth Act No. 141 or the Public Land Act governs the grant of homestead patents. Under Section 12 of the law, an applicant \"may enter a homestead of not exceeding twenty-four hectares of agricultural land of the public domain.\" A homestead patent or title to the homestead is issued only if the applicant has improved and cultivated at least one-fifth of the agricultural land applied for. Section 14 of the Public Land Act provides:Sec. 14. No certificate shall be given or patent issued for the land applied for until at least one-fifth of the land has been improved and cultivated. The period within which the land shall be cultivated shall not be less than one nor more than five years from and after the date of the approval of the application. The applicant shall, within the said period, notify the Director of Lands as soon as he is ready to acquire the title. If at the date of such notice, the applicant shall prove to the satisfaction of the Director of Lands, that he has resided continuously for at least one year in the municipality in which the land is located, or in a municipality adjacent to the same, and has cultivated at least one-fifth of the land continuously since the approval of the application, and shall make affidavit that no part of said land has been alienated or encumbered, and that he has complied with all the requirements of this Act, then upon the payment of five pesos, as final fee, he shall be entitled to a patent.The state grants homestead rights \"to encourage residence upon and the cultivation and improvement of [agricultural lands] of the public domain.\"[9] In Jocson v. Soriano,[10] this court further explained the purpose of granting and protecting homesteads:[The object of homestead laws] is to provide a home for each citizen of the Government, where his family may shelter and live beyond the reach of financial misfortune, and to inculcate in individuals those feelings of independence which are essential to the maintenance of free institutions. Furthermore, the state itself is concerned that the citizens shall not be divested of a means of support, and reduced to pauperism.The conservation of a family home is the purpose of homestead laws. The policy of the state is to foster families as the factors of society, and thus promote general welfare. The sentiment of patriotism and independence, the spirit of free citizenship, the feeling of interest in public affairs, are cultivated and fostered more readily when the citizen lives permanently in his own home, with a sense of its protection and durability.[11] (Citations omitted)In 1982, this court had the opportunity to resolve the issue of who has the better right to a homestead-the homesteader or the tenant tilling the land. In Patricio v. Bayog,[12] this court said that \"the more paramount and superior policy consideration is to uphold the right of the homesteader and his heirs to own and cultivate personally the land acquired from the State without being encumbered by tenancy relations.\"[13]In Alita v. Court of Appeals,[14] this court categorically ruled that lands obtained through homestead patents are not covered by the agrarian reform program, the rights of homesteaders being \"superior\"[15] to the rights of tenants. This court said that the provisions of Presidential Decree No. 72, Series of 1972, then governing agrarian reform, \"cannot be invoked to defeat the very purpose of the enactment of the Public Land Act or Commonwealth Act No. 141.\"[16] Citing Patricio:The Homestead Act has been enacted for the welfare and protection of the poor. The law gives a needy citizen a piece of land where he may build a modest house for himself and family and plant what is necessary for subsistence and for the satisfaction of life's other needs. The right of the citizens to their homes and to the things necessary for their subsistence is as vital as the right to life itself. They have a right to live with a certain degree of comfort as become human beings, and the State which looks after the welfare 'of the people's happiness is under a duty to safeguard the satisfaction of this vital right.[17]In ruling for the homesteader in Alita, this court relied on Article XIII, Section 6 of the Constitution. This court went on to state that even the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Law of 1988 recognizes the \"inapplicability of [agrarian reform laws] to lands covered by homestead patents.\"[18] This court referred to the proviso in Section 6 of the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Law:Section 6. Retention Limits. Except as otherwise provided in this Act, no person may own or retain, directly or indirectly, any public or private agricultural land, the size of which shall vary according to factors governing a viable family-size farm, such as commodity produced, terrain, infrastructure, and soil fertility as determined by the Presidential Agrarian Reform Council (PARC) created hereunder, but in no case shall retention by the landowner exceed five (5) hectares. Three (3) hectares may be awarded to each child of the landowner, subject to the following qualifications: (1) that he is at least fifteen (15) years of age; and (2) that he is actually tilling the land or directly managing the farm: Provided, That landowners whose lands have been covered by Presidential Decree No. 27 shall be allowed to keep the area originally retained by them thereunder: Provided further, That original homestead grantees or their direct compulsory heirs who still own the original homestead at the time of the approval of this Act shall retain the same areas as long as they continue to cultivate said homestead (Emphasis supplied)However, contrary to the Alita ruling, this court used Section 6 as legal basis to rule that homesteads are covered by the agrarian reform program. In the 2001 case of Paris v. Alfeche,[19] the state granted Florencia Paris a homestead patent over a parcel of land in Paitan, Quezon, Bukidnon. Emancipation patents were subsequently issued to the tenants tilling her property, depriving Paris and her children of their right to personally cultivate their property.To recover her property, Paris filed an application to retain at least five (5) hectares of her property in Bukidnon. Since her property was covered by a homestead patent, Paris argued, among others, that she and her children have the better right to cultivate their land as this court ruled in Patricio and Alita.The Department of Agrarian Reform Adjudicator ruled in favor of Paris and cancelled the emancipation patents issued to the tenants. On appeal, however, the Department of Agrarian Reform Adjudication Board reversed the Adjudicator and declared the tenants as \"full owners of the land they till.\"[20] The Court of Appeals agreed with the Department of Agrarian Reform Adjudication Board and affirmed its Decision.This court affirmed the Court of Appeals' Decision, ruling that \"parcels of land . . . covered by homestead patents [are] not automatically exempt . . . from the operation of land reform.\" Section 6 of the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Law allows homesteaders to retain their land \"as long as they continue to cultivate [their] homestead.\"[21] Therefore, \"it is the fact of continued cultivation by the original grantees or their direct compulsory heirs that shall exempt their lands from land reform coverage.\"[22]Finding that Paris and her children were not personally cultivating their homestead, this court denied Paris' application for retention.On Paris' contention that she and her children, as homesteaders, had the better right to cultivate their land, this court held that Patricio and Alita did not apply to Paris' case: The homesteaders in Patricio and Alita showed their intention to continue cultivating their homesteads.[23] Thus, this court allowed the homesteaders to retain their properties in Patricio and Alita.Unlike the homesteaders in Patricio and Alita, this court found that Paris and her children never personally cultivated their homestead, and they never expressed their intention to do so. For these reasons, this court denied Paris' application for retention and surmised that Paris and her children would \"undoubtedly continue to be absentee landlords\":[24][T]he rulings in both Patricio and Alita, which are in line with the state objective of fostering owner cultivatorship and of abolishing tenancy, would be inapplicable to the present case. Since petitioner and her heirs have evinced no intention of actually cultivating the lands or even directly managing the farm, they will undoubtedly continue to be absentee landlords. Therefore, to blindly and indiscriminately apply the ruling in the cited cases would be tantamount to encouraging feudalistic practices and going against the very essence of agrarian reform. This we cannot sanction.[25] (Citation omitted)Despite this court's ruling in Paris, I maintain that the property should be exempt from agrarian reform. As this court held in Patricio and Alita, the right of tenants to own the land they till through agrarian reform is subject to the fight of homesteaders to personally cultivate their property. This right of homesteaders is guaranteed by no less than the Constitution.In providing that homesteaders may retain their land \"as long as they continue to cultivate said homestead,\" Section 6 of the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Law is unconstitutional. The Constitution does not require homesteaders to show their intention to cultivate their land before their properties are exempted from agrarian reform coverage. Under the law, homestead patents are granted only if the applicants have proven to the satisfaction of the Director of Lands that they have entered, improved, and cultivated the land applied for.[26] It must therefore be presumed that grantees of homestead patents cultivate their land.In any case, the Heirs of Manuel Pacquing must be allowed to retain their homestead, similar to the homesteaders in Patricio and Alita. As this court declared in Paris, homesteaders are allowed to retain their property if they show their intention to continue cultivating their property.[27] As the Office of the President found, the Heirs of Manuel Pacquing have shown their intention to continue cultivating their property by protesting the issuance of certificates of land ownership award to Almero, et al. The Heirs of Manuel Pacquing \"should be given the chance to exercise their rights as heirs of the homestead grantee to continue to cultivate the homestead lots either personally or directly managing the farm pursuant to the pronouncement in the Paris case.\"[28]IIIThis case must be elevated to the court en bancIn the alternative, this case must be elevated to the court en bane considering that the constitutionality of Section 6 of the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Law is at issue in this case. Rule 2, Section 3(a) of the Internal Rules of the Supreme Court provides:Section 3. Court en banc matters and cases.- The Court en bane shall act on the following matters and cases:(a) cases in which the constitutionality or validity of any treaty, international or executive agreement, law, executive order, presidential decree, proclamation, order, instruction, ordinance, or regulation is in question[.]IN VIEW OF THE FOREGOING, I vote to DENY the Petition for Review on Certiorari.

These lands were registered on January 6, 1955 with the Register of Deeds under Original Certificate of Title No. (P-2590) P-653.\n\nThe records show that, on August 5, 1991, the Municipal Agrarian Reform Officer ( MARO ) sent Miguel's representative a Notice of Coverage placing the Pacquing Estate under the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Program ( CARP ). Miguel failed to reply to the notice and, instead filed a Voluntary Offer to Sell ( VOS ) with the Department of Agrarian Reform ( DAR ) on August 31, 1991. Miguel, however, died during the pendency of the VOS proceedings. Miguel's wife, Salome, had died five years earlier.\n\nIn January 1992, respondent Linda Pacquing-Fadrilan, sole heir of the spouses Pacquing, executed an affidavit adjudicating to herself ownership of the property. In August of the same year, she filed an application for retention with the DAR Regional Director who denied Linda's application in an order dated December 14, 1993. The order denying Linda's application for retention later became final and executory.\n\nOn June 25, 1994, certain individuals, including the present petitioners who were earlier identified as farmer-beneficiaries of the subject land, were issued CLOAs over their respective cultivated portions of the property.\n\nOn October 20, 1999, Linda, through her attorney-in-fact, Samuel Osias, filed with the Office of the Provincial Adjudicator in Tagum City a petition to cancel the petitioners' CLOAs. The Provincial Adjudicator later dismissed the petition due to Linda's failure to file her position paper. She appealed the dismissal with the Department of Agrarian Reform Adjudication Board ( DARAB ).\n\nIt appears that, in the meantime, Transfer Certificates of Title ( TCTs ) covering portions of the property were issued to Napoleon Villa Sr., et al. who had been contracted by Linda, under an agricultural leasehold agreement, to cultivate the lands.\n\nIn a resolution dated June 29, 2001, the DARAB nullified the TCTs issued to Napoleon Villa Sr. et. al. and reinstated Linda's title to the property. At the same time, the DARAB ordered the generation and issuance of titles to the petitioners and other farmer-beneficiaries of the subject land . In a subsequent resolution dated September 28, 2001, the DARAB validated the TCTs issued to the following individuals: Danilo Almero, Celia Bulaso, Ludy Ramada, Isidro Lazarte, Cepriano Lazarte, Thelma Emorque, Domingo Juanico, Candido Labeste and Renato Benimate.\n\nRoot of the present petition: Petition to Recall and Cancel the petitioners' CLOAs\n\nLinda again sought to recall and cancel the petitioners' CLOAs by filing a petition with the DAR, which the latter endorsed to the DAR Regional Office. Linda argued that the DARAB erred in distributing portions of the land to the petitioners because the entire property was supposed to be exempt from CARP coverage. The petitioners opposed Linda's petition.\n\nIn an order dated December 18, 2008, the DAR Regional Director ruled that the Pacquing Estate was subject to CARP and that the CLOAs issued to the petitioners were valid. Linda filed an appeal to the DAR Secretary.\n\nIn an order dated August 18, 2009, former DAR Secretary Nasser C. Pangandaman denied Linda's appeal under the following terms:\n\n\"xxx, under Section 6 of R.A. No. 6657, there are two requisites to exempt homestead lands from CARP coverage. First, the homestead grantee or his direct compulsory heir(s) still own the original homestead at the time of the effectivity of R.A. No. 6657 on 15 June 1988; and second, the original homestead grantee or his direct compulsory heir(s) was cultivating the homestead as of 15 June 1988 and continues to cultivate the same.\n\nIn this case, it is undisputed that the subject landholdings were still owned by the original homestead grantees at the time of the effectivity of R.A. No. 6657. However, the said homestead grantees no longer cultivate the same. Therefore, on this score, the subject landholdings cannot be exempted from CARP coverage .\" ( Emphasis ours )\nLinda appealed the DAR Secretary's August 18,2009 order to the OP.\n\nIn a decision dated February 16, 2011, the OP, through Executive Secretary Paquito N. Ochoa Jr., reversed the DAR Secretary's August 18, 2009 Order and recalled and cancelled the petitioners' CLOAs. The OP held that:\n\n\"xxx, the fact that petitioners-appellants ( referring to the respondent Linda ), since the beginning, have always protested the issuance of the CLOAs to the respondents-appellees ( referring to the petitioners ) is a clear demonstration of their willingness to continue with the cultivation of the subject landholdings, or to start anew with the cultivation or even to direct the management of the farm.\n\nGiven the foregoing, petitioners-appellants should be given the chance to exercise their rights as heirs of the homestead grantee to continue to cultivate the homestead lots either personally or directly managing the farm pursuant to the pronouncement in the Paris case. They still own the original homestead issued to their predecessor-in-interest and have manifested their intention to continue with the cultivation of the homestead lots. \" [4] ( Emphasis supplied )\n\nThe petitioners moved to reconsider the decision, but the OP denied their motion in a resolution [5] dated July 19, 2011.\n\nWith no appeal or petition for review filed with the Court of Appeals within the fifteen (15) - day appeal period, the DAR Bureau of Agrarian Legal Assistance issued on August 22, 2011 a Certificate of Finality [6] declaring as final and executory the OP's February 16, 2011 decision and July 19, 2011 resolution . The petitioners, however, contest the finality of the OP's decision and allege that their counsel only received a certified copy of the OP's resolution denying their motion for reconsideration on September 29, 2011.\n\nOn November 14, 2011, the petitioners directly filed with this Court a petition for review on certiorari under Rule 45 assailing the subject OP's decision and resolution.\n\nThe Petition\nThe petitioners raise the following issues:\n\nI- WHO WILL ISSUE A CERTIFICATE OF FINALITY OF THE DECISION WHEN THE DECISION OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENCY IS REVERSE (sic) ON APPEAL BY THE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT?\n\nII- ARE LANDS UNDER THE HOMESTEAD GRANT, EXEMPT FROM AGRARIAN REFORM COVERAGE UNDER SECTION 6 OF R.A. 6657, EVEN IF THE HEIR OF THE PATENTEE IS NOT CULTIVATING THE LAND, BUT AND HAD EVEN OFFERED THE SAME UNDER THE VOLUNTARY OFFER TO SELL SCHEME?\n\nIII- IN CARP COVERAGE, IS DEPOSIT OF LANDOWNER'S COMPENSATION WITH LAND BANK OF THE PHILIPPINES ENOUGH TO TRANSFER TITLE TO THE STATE, EVEN IF THE OWNER DOES NOT ACCEPT THE SAME? [7] ( Emphasis supplied )\n\nPleadings Subsequent to the Petition\n\nIn her comment dated March 16, 2012, [8] Linda counter-argues that the present petition should be denied outright for being an improper mode of appeal: the appeal from the OP's assailed decision and resolution should have been filed with the CA via a petition for review under Rule 43 and not directly with this Court via a petition for review on certiorari under Rule 45.\n\nThe petitioners filed their counter-comment/reply [9] asking this Court to decide the present case not on technicalities but based on its merits, and that the Court, instead, treat their petition as a special civil action for certiorari under Rule 65.\n\nOUR RULING\n\nWe see MERIT in the present petition.\n\nFirst, we address the procedural issue raised by the respondent.\n\nUnder Rule 43 of the Rules of Court, an appeal from the awards, judgments, final orders or resolutions of or authorized by any quasi-judicial agency such as the Office of the President, in the exercise of its quasi-\u00adjudicial functions shall be filed to the CA [10] within a period of fifteen (15) days from notice of, publication or denial of a motion for new trial or reconsideration. [11] The appeal may involve questions of fact, of law, or mixed questions of fact and law. [12]\n\nA direct resort to this Court, however, may be allowed in cases where only questions of law are raised . [13] A question of law exists when the doubt or controversy concerns the correct application of law or jurisprudence to a certain set of facts; or when the issue does not call for an examination of the probative value of the evidence presented, the truth or falsehood of facts being admitted. [14]\n\nIn the present petition, the petitioners raised valid questions of law that warranted the direct recourse to this Court. Basically, they question the OP's application of the law and jurisprudence on the issue of whether the Pacquing Estate should be exempt from CARP coverage. In this case, no further examination of the truth or falsity of the facts is required. Our review of the case is limited to the determination of whether the OP has correctly applied the law and jurisprudence based on the facts on record.\n\nWe now proceed to the merits of the case.\n\nR.A. No. 6657 or the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Law ( CARL ) of 1988 covers all public and private agricultural lands as provided in Proclamation No. 131 [15] and E.O. No. 229, [16] including other lands of the public domain suitable for agriculture. Section 4 of R.A. 6657, as amended, [17] specifically lists the lands covered by the CARP, which include:\n\n[TABLE_CONTENT]\n(a) | All alienable and disposable lands of the public domain devoted to or suitable for agriculture. No reclassification of forest or mineral lands to agricultural lands shall be undertaken after the approval of this Act until Congress, taking into account ecological, developmental and equity considerations, shall have determined by law, the specific limits of the public domain;\n(b) | All lands of the public domain in excess to the specific limits as determined by Congress in the preceding paragraph;\n(c) | All other lands owned by the Government devoted to or suitable for agriculture; and\n(d) | All private lands devoted to or suitable for agriculture regardless of the agricultural products raised or that can be raised thereon.\n[END_TABLE]\n\n(a) All alienable and disposable lands of the public domain devoted to or suitable for agriculture. No reclassification of forest or mineral lands to agricultural lands shall be undertaken after the approval of this Act until Congress, taking into account ecological, developmental and equity considerations, shall have determined by law, the specific limits of the public domain; (b) All lands of the public domain in excess to the specific limits as determined by Congress in the preceding paragraph; (c) All other lands owned by the Government devoted to or suitable for agriculture; and (d) All private lands devoted to or suitable for agriculture regardless of the agricultural products raised or that can be raised thereon.\nAnd Section 10 of R.A. 6657, as amended, [18] expressly provides for the lands exempted or excluded from the CARP, namely:\n\n(a) Lands actually, directly and exclusively used for parks, wildlife, forest reserves, reforestation, fish sanctuaries and breeding grounds, watersheds and mangroves shall be exempt from the coverage of this Act;\n\n(b) Private lands actually, directly and exclusively used for prawn farms and fishponds shall be exempt from the coverage of this Act: Provided, that said prawn farms and fishponds have not been distributed and Certificate of Land Ownership (CLOA) issued under the Agrarian Reform Program; and\n\nxxxx\n\n(c) Lands actually, directly and exclusively used and found to be necessary for national defense, school sites and campuses, including experimental farms stations operated by public or private schools for educational purposes, seeds and seedlings research and pilot production centers, church sites and covenants appurtenant thereto, mosque sites and Islamic centers appurtenant thereto, communal burial grounds and cemeteries, penal colonies and penal farms actually worked by the inmates, government and private research and quarantine centers and all lands with eighteen percent (18%) slope and over, except those already developed, shall be exempt from the coverage of this Act.\nThe subject land, being agricultural in nature, is clearly not exempt from CARP coverage.\n\nBut Linda argues that the subject land is exempt from CARP primarily because it was acquired by her father via a homestead patent. She claims that the rights of homestead grantees have been held superior to those of agrarian reform tenants and, thus, her right to the subject land must be upheld. The OP, agreeing with the respondent, stated that:\n\n\"There can be no question that, weighed against each other, the rights of a homesteader prevail over the rights of the tenants guaranteed by agrarian reform laws.\n\nAs early as the case of Patricio v. Bayug , it has been held that the more paramount and superior policy consideration is to uphold the right of the homesteader and his heirs to own and cultivate personally the land acquired from the State without being encumbered by tenancy relations.\n\nJust right after the promulgation of Republic Act No. 6657, otherwise known as the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Law (CARL), the doctrine enunciated in Patricio was applied in Alita v. Court of Appeals where it was held that Presidential Decree No. 27 cannot be invoked to defeat the very purpose of the enactment of the Public Land Act or Commonwealth Act No. 141. It was further pointed out that even the Philippine Constitution respects the superiority of the homesteaders' rights over the rights of the tenants guaranteed by the Agrarian Reform statute.\" [19] ( Citations omitted .)\nThe right of homestead grantees to retain or keep their homestead is, however, not absolutely guaranteed by law. Section 6 of R.A 6657 provides that:\n\n\" Section 6. Retention Limits. -Except as otherwise provided in this Act, no person may own or retain, directly or indirectly, any public or private agricultural land, the size of which shall vary according to factors governing a viable family-size farm, such as commodity produced, terrain, infrastructure, and soil fertility as determined by the Presidential Agrarian Reform Council (PARC) created hereunder, but in no case shall retention by the landowner exceed five (5) hectares. Three (3) hectares may be awarded to each child of the landowner, subject to the following qualifications: (1) that he is at least fifteen (15) years of age; and (2) that he is actually tilling the land or directly managing the farm: provided, that landowners whose lands have been covered by Presidential Decree No. 27 shall be allowed to keep the areas originally retained by them thereunder: provided, further, that original homestead grantees or their direct compulsory heirs who still own the original homestead at the time of the approval of this Act shall retain the same areas as long as they continue to cultivate said homestead. (Emphasis ours)\nThus, in order for the homestead grantees or their direct compulsory heirs to retain or keep their homestead, the following conditions must first be satisfied: (a) they must still be the owners of the original homestead at the time of the CARL's effectivity, and (b) they must continue to cultivate the homestead land.\n\nIn this case, Linda, as the direct compulsory heir of the original homestead grantee, is no longer cultivating the subject homestead land. The OP misinterpreted our ruling in Paris v. Alfeche [20] when it held that Linda's mere expression of her desire to continue or to start anew with the cultivation of the land would suffice to exempt the subject homestead land from the CARL. On the contrary, we specifically held in Paris v. Alfeche that:\n\n\"Indisputably, homestead grantees or their direct compulsory heirs can own and retain the original homestead, only for \" as long as they continue to cultivate \" them. That parcels of land are covered by homestead patents will not automatically exempt them from the operation of land reform. It is the fact of continued cultivation by the original grantees or their direct compulsory heirs that shall exempt their lands from land reform coverage .\" [21] ( Emphasis supplied )\nWHEREFORE , in view of the foregoing, we hereby:\n\n[TABLE_CONTENT]\n(a) | REVERSEandSET ASIDEthe February 16, 2011 Decision and July 19, 2011 Resolution of the Office of the President in OP Case No. 10-C-152;\n(b) | RECALLandREVOKEthe August 22, 2011 Certificate of Finality issued by the Department of Agrarian Reform Bureau of Agrarian Legal Assistance; and\n(c) | AFFIRMthe August 18, 2009 Order of the Department of Agrarian Reform Secretary in DARCO Order No. MS-0908-295 Series of2009 A-999-10-CLT-028-09.\n[END_TABLE]\n\n(a) REVERSE and SET ASIDE the February 16, 2011 Decision and July 19, 2011 Resolution of the Office of the President in OP Case No. 10-C-152; (b) RECALL and REVOKE the August 22, 2011 Certificate of Finality issued by the Department of Agrarian Reform Bureau of Agrarian Legal Assistance; and (c) AFFIRM the August 18, 2009 Order of the Department of Agrarian Reform Secretary in DARCO Order No. MS-0908-295 Series of2009 A-999-10-CLT-028-09.\n\nSO ORDERED.\n\nCarpio, (Chairperson), Del Castillo, and Mendoza, JJ , concur.\nLeonen, J., see dissenting opinion.\n\n[1] Dated November 11, 2011; rollo, pp. 35-49.\n\n[2] Id. at 51-55.\n\n[3] Id. at 68-69.\n\n[4] Id. at 11.\n\n[5] Supra note 3.\n\n[6] Rollo , pp. 73-74.\n\n[7] Id. at 41.\n\n[8] Id. at 188-192.\n\n[9] Dated June 10, 2013; Rollo , pp. 211-213.\n\n[10] Section 1, Rule 43 of the Rules of Court.\n\n[11] Section 4, Rule 43 of the Rules of Court.\n\n[12] Section 3, Rule 43 of the Rules of Court.\n\n[13] Section 2 (c), Rule 41 of the Rules of Court.\n\n[14] Bukidnon Doctors' Hospital, Inc. v.

First, the Office of the President's February 16, 2011 Decision [1] is already final and executory. This court, therefore, may no longer review the Decision.\n\nSecond, the property in this case is covered by a homestead patent. Thus, it is exempt from agrarian reform coverage. The heirs of the original homesteader must be given the chance to cultivate their land.\nI\n\nThis court may no longer review the final and executory Decision of the\nOffice of the President\nUnder Rule 43 of the Rules of Court, decisions of the Office of the President are appealed before the Court of Appeals through a Petition for Review raising questions of fact, of law, or mixed questions of fact and law. [2] The Appeal must be filed within 15 days from notice of the\u00b7 decision or resolution denying the Motion for Reconsideration as provided in Rule 43, Sections 1 and 4:\n\nSection 1. Scope. - This Rule shall apply to appeals from judgments or final orders of the Court of Tax Appeals and from awards, judgments, final orders or resolutions of or authorized by any quasi\u00ad judicial agency in the exercise of its quasi-judicial functions. Among these agencies are the Civil Service Commission, Central Board of Assessment Appeals, Securities and Exchange Commission, Office of the President, Land Registration Authority, Social Security Commission, Civil Aeronautics Board, Bureau of Patents, Trademarks and Technology Transfer, National Electrification Administration, Energy Regulatory Board, National Telecommunications .Commission, Department of Agrarian Reform under Republic Act No. 6657, Government Service Insurance System, Employees Compensation Commission, Agricultural Inventions Board, Insurance Commission, Philippine Atomic Energy Commission, Board of Investments, Construction Industry Arbitration Commission, and voluntary arbitrators authorized by law.\n\nSec. 4. Period of appeal . The appeal shall be taken within fifteen (15) days from notice of the award, judgment, final order or resolution, or from the date of its last publication, if publication is required by law for its effectivity, or of the denial of petitioner's motion for new trial or reconsideration duly filed in accordance with the governing law of the court or agency a quo. Only one (1) motion for reconsideration s,hall be allowed. Upon proper motion and the payment of the full amount of the docket fee before the expiration of the reglementary period, the Court of Appeals may grant an additional period of fifteen (15) days only within which to file the petition for review. No further extension shall be granted except for the most compelling reason and in no case to exceed fifteen (15) days.\nPetitioners Danilo Almero, Teresita Alagon, Celia Bulaso, Ludy Ramada, Regina Gegremosa, Isidro Lazarte, Thelma Embarque, Felipe Lazarte, Guilerma Lazarte, and Dulcesima Benimele (Almero, et al.) availed themselves of the wrong remedy against the Office of the President's Decision. Instead of directly appealing before this court, Almero, et al. should have filed a Petition for Review before the Court of Appeals under Rule 43.\n\nIt is 'true that a Petition for Rev ew on Certiorari may be directly filed before thiscourt ifthe Petition raises pure questions oflaw. [3] However, even assuming that Almero, et al.'s Petition raises pure questions of law, this court should have dismissed outright Almero, et al.'s Petition for having been filed out of time. Under Rule 45, Section 2 of the Rules of Court, a Petition for Review on Certiorari must be filed within 15 days from notice of the assailed Decision or Resolution:\n\nSec. 2. Time for filing; extension. The petition shall be filed within fifteen (15) days from notice of the judgment or final order or resolution appealed from, or of the denial of the petitioner's motion for new trial or reconsideration filed in due time after notice of the judgment. On motion duly filed and served, with full payment of the docket and other lawful fees and the deposit for costs before the expiration of the reglementary period, the Supreme Court may for justifiable reasons grant an extension of thirty (30) days only within which to file the petition.\nAlmero, et al. had notice of the Office of the President's Resolution denying their Motion for Reconsideration on September 29, 2011. Thus, Almero, et al. had until October 14, 2011 to file their Appeal. Yet, Almero, et al. appealed before this court only on November 14, 2011, which was beyond 15 days from their notice of the Resolution denying their Motion for Reconsideration. Their filing of the Petition, therefore, did not toll the reglementary period for filing an appeal. The Decision of the Office of the President has become final and executory as of October 15, 2011, and this court may no longer review the Decision.\n\nII\n\nThe property is exempt from coverage of the Comprehensive Agrarian\nReform Program\nAgrarian reform is the \"redistribution of lands, regardless of crops or fruits produced, to farmers and regular farmworkers who are landless.\" [4] It includes not only the physical redistribution of lands but also other alternative arrangements, such as production or profit-sharing, labor administration, and the redistribution of shares of stock all aimed to lift the economic status of the property's farmer-beneficiaries. [5]\n\nAs a general rule, all agricultural lands, whether public or private, are covered by the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Program. [6] An agricultural land refers to land devoted to any of the following agricultural activities: cultivation of the soil, planting of crops, growing of fruit trees, raising of livestock, poultry or fish, including the harvesting of such farm products, and other farm activities and practices performed by a farmer in conjunction with such farming operations done by persons whether natural or juridical. [7] Section 4 of the Comprehensive Agrarian. Reform Law enumerates properties covered by the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Program:\n\nSEC. 4. Scope. The Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Law of 1988 shall cover, regardless of tenurial arrangement and commodity produced, all public and private agricultural lands as provided in Proclamation No. 131 and Executive Order No. 229, including other lands of tho public domain suitable for agriculture.\n\nMore specifically, the following lands are covered by the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Program:\n\nAll alienable and disposable lands of the public domain devoted to or suitable for agriculture. No reclassification of forest or mineral lands to agricultural lands shall be undertaken after the approval of this Act until Congress, taking into account ecological, developmental and equity considerations, shall have determined by law, the specific limits of the public domain;\n\nAll lands of the public domain in excess of the specific limits as determined by Congress in the preceding paragraph;\n\nAll other lands owned by the Government devoted to or suitable for agriculture; and\n\nAll private lands devoted to or suitable for agriculture regardless of the agricultural products raised or that 'can be raised thereon.\nAs for the properties exempt from agrarian reform coverage, Section 10 of the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Law provides:\n\nSEC. 10. Exemptions and Exclusions . Lands actually, directly and exclusively used and found to be necessary for parks, wildlife, forest reserves, reforestation, fish sanctuaries and breeding grounds, watersheds and mangroves, national defense, school sites and campuses including experimental farm stations operated by public or private schools for educational purposes, seeds and seedlings research and pilot production centers, church sites and convents appurtenant thereto, mosque sites and Islamic centers appurtenant thereto, communal burial grounds and cemeteries, penal colonies and penal farms actually worked by the inmates, government and private research and quarantine centers and all lands with eighteen percent (18%) slope and over, except those already developed shall be exempt from the coverage of this Act.\n\nIn the present case, the majority ruled that the property of the Heirs of Manuel Pacquing is covered by the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Program, the property being an agricultural land.\n\nI disagree with the majority. The property in this case is exempt from agrarian reform, having been granted to Manuel Pacquing through a homestead patent.\n\nAlthough a social justice measure, [8] agrarian reform is subject to limitations. Under Article XIII, Section 6 of the Constitution, distribution of lands through agrarian reform is \"subject to prior rights, homestead rights of small settlers, and the rights of indigenous cultural communities to their ancestral lands\":\n\nSection 6. The State shall apply the principles of agrarian reform or stewardship, whenever applicable in accordance with law, in the disposition or utilization of other natural resources, including land of the public domain under lease or concession suitable to agriculture, subject to prior rights, homestead rights of small settlers, and the rights of indigenous cultural communities to their ancestral lands . (Emphasis supplied)\n\nChapter IV of Commonwealth Act No. 141 or the Public Land Act governs the grant of homestead patents. Under Section 12 of the law, an applicant \"may enter a homestead of not exceeding twenty-four hectares of agricultural land of the public domain.\" A homestead patent or title to the homestead is issued only if the applicant has improved and cultivated at least one-fifth of the agricultural land applied for. Section 14 of the Public Land Act provides:\n\nSec. 14. No certificate shall be given or patent issued for the land applied for until at least one-fifth of the land has been improved and cultivated. The period within which the land shall be cultivated shall not be less than one nor more than five years from and after the date of the approval of the application. The applicant shall, within the said period, notify the Director of Lands as soon as he is ready to acquire the title. If at the date of such notice, the applicant shall prove to the satisfaction of the Director of Lands, that he has resided continuously for at least one year in the municipality in which the land is located, or in a municipality adjacent to the same, and has cultivated at least one-fifth of the land continuously since the approval of the application, and shall make affidavit that no part of said land has been alienated or encumbered, and that he has complied with all the requirements of this Act, then upon the payment of five pesos, as final fee, he shall be entitled to a patent.\nThe state grants homestead rights \"to encourage residence upon and the cultivation and improvement of [agricultural lands] of the public domain.\" [9] In Jocson v. Soriano , [10] this court further explained the purpose of granting and protecting homesteads:\n\n[The object of homestead laws] is to provide a home for each citizen of the Government, where his family may shelter and live beyond the reach of financial misfortune, and to inculcate in individuals those feelings of independence which are essential to the maintenance of free institutions. Furthermore, the state itself is concerned that the citizens shall not be divested of a means of support, and reduced to pauperism.\n\nThe conservation of a family home is the purpose of homestead laws. The policy of the state is to foster families as the factors of society, and thus promote general welfare. The sentiment of patriotism and independence, the spirit of free citizenship, the feeling of interest in public affairs, are cultivated and fostered more readily when the citizen lives permanently in his own home, with a sense of its protection and durability. [11] (Citations omitted)\n\nIn 1982, this court had the opportunity to resolve the issue of who has the better right to a homestead-the homesteader or the tenant tilling the land. In Patricio v. Bayog, [12] this court said that \"the more paramount and superior policy consideration is to uphold the right of the homesteader and his heirs to own and cultivate personally the land acquired from the State without being encumbered by tenancy relations.\" [13]\n\nIn Alita v. Court of Appeals , [14] this court categorically ruled that lands obtained through homestead patents are not covered by the agrarian reform program, the rights of homesteaders being \"superior\" [15] to the rights of tenants. This court said that the provisions of Presidential Decree No. 72, Series of 1972, then governing agrarian reform, \"cannot be invoked to defeat the very purpose of the enactment of the Public Land Act or Commonwealth Act No. 141.\" [16] Citing Patricio :\n\nThe Homestead Act has been enacted for the welfare and protection of the poor. The law gives a needy citizen a piece of land where he may build a modest house for himself and family and plant what is necessary for subsistence and for the satisfaction of life's other needs. The right of the citizens to their homes and to the things necessary for their subsistence is as vital as the right to life itself. They have a right to live with a certain degree of comfort as become human beings, and the State which looks after the welfare 'of the people's happiness is under a duty to safeguard the satisfaction of this vital right. [17]\nIn ruling for the homesteader in Alita , this court relied on Article XIII, Section 6 of the Constitution. This court went on to state that even the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Law of 1988 recognizes the \"inapplicability of [agrarian reform laws] to lands covered by homestead patents.\" [18] This court referred to the proviso in Section 6 of the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Law:\n\nSection 6. Retention Limits . Except as otherwise provided in this Act, no person may own or retain, directly or indirectly, any public or private agricultural land, the size of which shall vary according to factors governing a viable family-size farm, such as commodity produced, terrain, infrastructure, and soil fertility as determined by the Presidential Agrarian Reform Council (PARC) created hereunder, but in no case shall retention by the landowner exceed five (5) hectares. Three (3) hectares may be awarded to each child of the landowner, subject to the following qualifications: (1) that he is at least fifteen (15) years of age; and (2) that he is actually tilling the land or directly managing the farm: Provided, That landowners whose lands have been covered by Presidential Decree No. 27 shall be allowed to keep the area originally retained by them thereunder: Provided further, That original homestead grantees or their direct compulsory heirs who still own the original homestead at the time of the approval of this Act shall retain the same areas as long as they continue to cultivate said homestead (Emphasis supplied)\n\nHowever, contrary to the Alita ruling, this court used Section 6 as legal basis to rule that homesteads are covered by the agrarian reform program. In the 2001 case of Paris v. Alfeche , [19] the state granted Florencia Paris a homestead patent over a parcel of land in Paitan, Quezon, Bukidnon. Emancipation patents were subsequently issued to the tenants tilling her property, depriving Paris and her children of their right to personally cultivate their property.\n\nTo recover her property, Paris filed an application to retain at least five (5) hectares of her property in Bukidnon. Since her property was covered by a homestead patent, Paris argued, among others, that she and her children have the better right to cultivate their land as this court ruled in Patricio and Alita.\n\nThe Department of Agrarian Reform Adjudicator ruled in favor of Paris and cancelled the emancipation patents issued to the tenants. On appeal, however, the Department of Agrarian Reform Adjudication Board reversed the Adjudicator and declared the tenants as \"full owners of the land they till.\" [20] The Court of Appeals agreed with the Department of Agrarian Reform Adjudication Board and affirmed its Decision.\n\nThis court affirmed the Court of Appeals' Decision, ruling that \"parcels of land . . . covered by homestead patents [are] not automatically exempt . . . from the operation of land reform.\" Section 6 of the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Law allows homesteaders to retain their land \"as long as they continue to cultivate [their] homestead.\" [21] Therefore, \"it is the fact of continued cultivation by the original grantees or their direct compulsory heirs that shall exempt their lands from land reform coverage.\" [22]\n\nFinding that Paris and her children were not personally cultivating their homestead, this court denied Paris' application for retention.\n\nOn Paris' contention that she and her children, as homesteaders, had the better right to cultivate their land, this court held that Patricio and Alita did not apply to Paris' case: The homesteaders in Patricio and Alita showed their intention to continue cultivating their homesteads. [23] Thus, this court allowed the homesteaders to retain their properties in Patricio and Alita .\n\nUnlike the homesteaders in Patricio and Alita, this court found that Paris and her children never personally cultivated their homestead, and they never expressed their intention to do so. For these reasons, this court denied Paris' application for retention and surmised that Paris and her children would \"undoubtedly continue to be absentee landlords\": [24]\n\n[T]he rulings in both Patricio and Alita , which are in line with the state objective of fostering owner cultivatorship and of abolishing tenancy, would be inapplicable to the present case. Since petitioner and her heirs have evinced no intention of actually cultivating the lands or even directly managing the farm, they will undoubtedly continue to be absentee landlords. Therefore, to blindly and indiscriminately apply the ruling in the cited cases would be tantamount to encouraging feudalistic practices and going against the very essence of agrarian reform. This we cannot sanction. [25] (Citation omitted)\nDespite this court's ruling in Paris , I maintain that the property should be exempt from agrarian reform. As this court held in Patricio and Alita , the right of tenants to own the land they till through agrarian reform is subject to the fight of homesteaders to personally cultivate their property. This right of homesteaders is guaranteed by no less than the Constitution.\n\nIn providing that homesteaders may retain their land \"as long as they continue to cultivate said homestead,\" Section 6 of the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Law is unconstitutional. The Constitution does not require homesteaders to show their intention to cultivate their land before their properties are exempted from agrarian reform coverage. Under the law, homestead patents are granted only if the applicants have proven to the satisfaction of the Director of Lands that they have entered, improved, and cultivated the land applied for. [26] It must therefore be presumed that grantees of homestead patents cultivate their land.\n\nIn any case, the Heirs of Manuel Pacquing must be allowed to retain their homestead, similar to the homesteaders in Patricio and Alita. As this court declared in Paris , homesteaders are allowed to retain their property if they show their intention to continue cultivating their property. [27] As the Office of the President found, the Heirs of Manuel Pacquing have shown their intention to continue cultivating their property by protesting the issuance of certificates of land ownership award to Almero, et al. The Heirs of Manuel Pacquing \"should be given the chance to exercise their rights as heirs of the homestead grantee to continue to cultivate the homestead lots either personally or directly managing the farm pursuant to the pronouncement in the Paris case.\" [28]\n\nIII\n\nThis case must be elevated to the court en banc\nIn the alternative, this case must be elevated to the court en bane considering that the constitutionality of Section 6 of the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Law is at issue in this case. Rule 2, Section 3(a) of the Internal Rules of the Supreme Court provides:\n\nSection 3. Court en banc matters and cases. - The Court en bane shall act on the following matters and cases:\n\n(a) cases in which the constitutionality or validity of any treaty, international or executive agreement, law, executive order, presidential decree, proclamation, order, instruction, ordinance, or regulation is in question[.]\nIN VIEW OF THE FOREGOING , I vote to DENY the Petition for Review on Certiorari.

COURT OF APPEALS AND CASH ASIA CREDIT CORPORATION, RESPONDENTS.D E C I S I O N PERLAS-BERNABE, J.: Assailed in this petition for certiorari[1] are the Decision[2] dated March 5, 2012 and the Resolution[3] dated October 4, 2012 of the Court of Appeals(CA) in CA-G.R. SP No. 117474, which annulled the Orders dated September 20, 2010[4] and October 22, 2010[5] of the Regional Trial Court of Manila, Branch 173 (RTC) in Civil Case No. 10-124040, denying private respondent Cash Asia Credit Corporation\u2019s (Cash Asia) motion to dismiss on the ground of improper venue.The FactsThe instant case arose from a Complaint[6] dated August 2, 2010 filed by Virgilio C. Briones (Briones) for Nullity of Mortgage Contract, Promissory Note, Loan Agreement, Foreclosure of Mortgage, Cancellation of Transfer Certificate of Title (TCT) No.290846, and Damages against Cash Asia before the RTC.[7] In his complaint, Briones alleged that he is the owner of a property covered by TCT No. 160689 (subject property),and that, on July 15, 2010, his sister informed him that his property had been foreclosed and a writ of possession had already been issued in favor of Cash Asia.[8] Upon investigation, Briones discovered that: (a) on December 6, 2007, he purportedly executed a promissory note,[9] loan agreement,[10] and deed of real estate mortgage[11]covering the subject property (subject contracts) in favor of Cash Asia in order to obtain a loan in the amount of P3,500,000.00 from the latter;[12] and (b) since the said loan was left unpaid, Cash Asia proceeded to foreclose his property.[13] In this relation, Briones claimed that he never contracted any loans from Cash Asia as he has been living and working in Vietnam since October 31, 2007. He further claimed that he only went back to the Philippines on December 28, 2007 until January 3, 2008 to spend the holidays with his family, and that during his brief stay in the Philippines, nobody informed him of any loan agreement entered into with Cash Asia. Essentially, Briones assailed the validity of the foregoing contracts claiming his signature to be forged.[14]For its part, Cash Asia filed a Motion to Dismiss[15] dated August 25, 2010, praying for the outright dismissal of Briones\u2019s complaint on the ground of improper venue.[16] In this regard, Cash Asia pointed out the venue stipulation in the subject contracts stating that \u201call legal actions arising out of this notice in connection with the Real Estate Mortgage subject hereof shall only be brought in or submitted to the jurisdiction of the proper court of Makati City.\u201d[17] In view thereof, it contended that all actions arising out of the subject contracts may only be exclusively brought in the courts of Makati City, and as such, Briones\u2019s complaint should be dismissed for having been filed in the City of Manila.[18]In response, Briones filed an opposition,[19] asserting, inter alia, that he should not be covered by the venue stipulation in the subject contracts as he was never a party therein. He also reiterated that his signatures on the said contracts were forgeries.[20]The RTC RulingIn an Order[21] dated September 20, 2010, the RTC denied Cash Asia\u2019s motion to dismiss for lack of merit. In denying the motion, the RTC opined that the parties must be afforded the right to be heard in view of the substance of Briones\u2019s cause of action against Cash Asia as stated in the complaint.[22]Cash Asia moved for reconsideration[23] which was, however, denied in an Order[24] dated October 22, 2010. Aggrieved, it filed a petition for certiorari[25] before the CA.The CA RulingIn a Decision[26] dated March 5, 2012, the CA annulled the RTC Orders, and accordingly, dismissed Briones\u2019s complaint without prejudice to the filing of the same before the proper court in Makati City.[27] It held that the RTC gravely abused its discretion in denying Cash Asia\u2019s motion to dismiss, considering that the subject contracts clearly provide that actions arising therefrom should be exclusively filed before the courts of Makati City only.[28] As such, the CA concluded that Briones\u2019s complaint should have been dismissed outright on the ground of improper venue,[29] this, notwithstanding Briones\u2019s claim of forgery.Dissatisfied, Briones moved for reconsideration,[30] which was, however, denied in a Resolution[31] dated October 4, 2012, hence, this petition.The Issue Before the CourtThe primordial issue for the Court\u2019s resolution is whether or not the CA gravely abused its discretion in ordering the outright dismissal of Briones\u2019s complaint on the ground of improper venue.The Court\u2019s RulingThe petition is meritorious.At the outset, the Court stresses that \u201c[t]o justify the grant of the extraordinary remedy of certiorari, [the petitioner] must satisfactorily show that the court or quasi-judicial authority gravely abused the discretion conferred upon it. Grave abuse of discretion connotes judgment exercised in a capricious and whimsical manner that is tantamount to lack of jurisdiction. To be considered \u2018grave,\u2019 discretion must be exercised in a despotic manner by reason of passion or personal hostility, and must be so patent and gross as to amount to an evasion of positive duty or to a virtual refusal to perform the duty enjoined by or to act at all in contemplation of law.\u201d[32]Guided by the foregoing considerations, the Court finds that the CA gravely abused its discretion in ordering the outright dismissal of Briones\u2019s complaint against Cash Asia, without prejudice to its re-filing before the proper court in Makati City.Rule 4 of the Rules of Court governs the rules on venue of civil actions, to wit:Rule 4VENUE OF ACTIONSSECTION 1. Venue of real actions. \u2014 Actions affecting title to or possession of real property, or interest therein, shall be commenced and tried in the proper court which has jurisdiction over the area wherein the real property involved, or a portion thereof, is situated.Forcible entry and detainer actions shall be commenced and tried in the municipal trial court of the municipality or city wherein the real property involved, or a portion thereof, is situated.SEC. 2. Venue of personal actions. \u2014 All other actions may be commenced and tried where the plaintiff or any of the principal plaintiffs resides, or where the defendant or any of the principal defendants resides, or in the case of a non-resident defendant where he may be found, at the election of the plaintiff.SEC. 3. Venue of actions against nonresidents. \u2014 If any of the defendants does not reside and is not found in the Philippines, and the action affects the personal status of the plaintiff, or any property of said defendant located in the Philippines, the action may be commenced and tried in the court of the place where the plaintiff resides, or where the property or any portion thereof is situated or found.SEC. 4. When Rule not applicable. \u2014 This Rule shall not apply \u2013(a) In those cases where a specific rule or law provides otherwise; or(b) Where the parties have validly agreed in writing before the filing of the action on the exclusive venue thereof.Based therefrom, the general rule is that the venue of real actions is the court which has jurisdiction over the area wherein the real property involved, or a portion thereof, is situated; while the venue of personal actions is the court which has jurisdiction where the plaintiff or the defendant resides, at the election of the plaintiff. As an exception, jurisprudence in Legaspi v. Rep. of the Phils.[33] instructs that the parties, thru a written instrument, may either introduce another venue where actions arising from such instrument may be filed, or restrict the filing of said actions in a certain exclusive venue, viz.:The parties, however, are not precluded from agreeing in writing on an exclusive venue, as qualified by Section 4 of the same rule. Written stipulations as to venue may be restrictive in the sense that the suit may be filed only in the place agreed upon, or merely permissive in that the parties may file their suit not only in the place agreed upon but also in the places fixed by law. As in any other agreement, what is essential is the ascertainment of the intention of the parties respecting the matter.As regards restrictive stipulations on venue, jurisprudence instructs that it must be shown that such stipulation is exclusive. In the absence of qualifying or restrictive words, such as \u201cexclusively,\u201d \u201cwaiving for this purpose any other venue,\u201d \u201cshall only\u201d preceding the designation of venue, \u201cto the exclusion of the other courts,\u201d or words of similar import, the stipulation should be deemed as merely an agreement on an additional forum, not as limiting venue to the specified place.[34] (Emphases and underscoring supplied)In this relation, case law likewise provides that in cases where the complaint assails only the terms, conditions, and/or coverage of a written instrument and not its validity, the exclusive venue stipulation contained therein shall still be binding on the parties, and thus, the complaint may be properly dismissed on the ground of improper venue.[35] Conversely, therefore, a complaint directly assailing the validity of the written instrument itself should not be bound by the exclusive venue stipulation contained therein and should be filed in accordance with the general rules on venue.To be sure, it would be inherently consistent for a complaint of this nature to recognize the exclusive venue stipulation when it, in fact, precisely assails the validity of the instrument in which such stipulation is contained.In this case, the venue stipulation found in the subject contracts is indeed restrictive in nature, considering that it effectively limits the venue of the actions arising therefrom to the courts of Makati City. However, it must be emphasized that Briones\u2019s complaint directly assails the validity of the subject contracts, claiming forgery in their execution. Given this circumstance, Briones cannot be expected to comply with the aforesaid venue stipulation, as his compliance therewith would mean an implicit recognition of their validity. Hence, pursuant to the general rules on venue, Briones properly filed his complaint before a court in the City of Manila where the subject property is located.In conclusion, the CA patently erred and hence committed grave abuse of discretion in dismissing Briones\u2019s complaint on the ground of improper venue.WHEREFORE, the petition is GRANTED. Accordingly, the Decision dated March 5, 2012 and the Resolution dated October 4, 2012 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 117474 are hereby ANNULLED and SET ASIDE.

Venue of actions against nonresidents. \u2014 If any of the defendants does not reside and is not found in the Philippines, and the action affects the personal status of the plaintiff, or any property of said defendant located in the Philippines, the action may be commenced and tried in the court of the place where the plaintiff resides, or where the property or any portion thereof is situated or found.\n\nSEC. 4. When Rule not applicable. \u2014 This Rule shall not apply \u2013\n\n(a) In those cases where a specific rule or law provides otherwise; or\n\n(b) Where the parties have validly agreed in writing before the filing of the action on the exclusive venue thereof.\nBased therefrom, the general rule is that the venue of real actions is the court which has jurisdiction over the area wherein the real property involved, or a portion thereof, is situated; while the venue of personal actions is the court which has jurisdiction where the plaintiff or the defendant resides, at the election of the plaintiff. As an exception, jurisprudence in Legaspi v. Rep. of the Phils. [33] instructs that the parties, thru a written instrument, may either introduce another venue where actions arising from such instrument may be filed, or restrict the filing of said actions in a certain exclusive venue, viz .:\n\nThe parties, however, are not precluded from agreeing in writing on an exclusive venue, as qualified by Section 4 of the same rule. Written stipulations as to venue may be restrictive in the sense that the suit may be filed only in the place agreed upon, or merely permissive in that\u00a0 the parties may file their suit not only in the place agreed upon but also in the places fixed by law . As in any other agreement, what is essential is the ascertainment of the intention of the parties respecting the matter.\n\nAs regards restrictive stipulations on venue, jurisprudence instructs that it must be shown that such stipulation is exclusive. In the absence of qualifying or restrictive words , such as \u201cexclusively,\u201d \u201cwaiving for this purpose any other venue,\u201d \u201cshall only\u201d preceding the designation of venue, \u201cto the exclusion of the other courts,\u201d or words of similar import, the stipulation should be deemed as merely an agreement on an additional forum, not as limiting venue to the specified place . [34] (Emphases and underscoring supplied)\nIn this relation, case law likewise provides that in cases where the complaint assails only the terms, conditions, and/or coverage of a written instrument and not its validity, the exclusive venue stipulation contained therein shall still be binding on the parties, and thus, the complaint may be properly dismissed on the ground of improper venue. [35] Conversely, therefore, a complaint directly assailing the validity of the written instrument itself should not be bound by the exclusive venue stipulation contained therein and should be filed in accordance with the general rules on venue.To be sure, it would be inherently consistent for a complaint of this nature to recognize the exclusive venue stipulation when it, in fact, precisely assails the validity of the instrument in which such stipulation is contained.\n\nIn this case, the venue stipulation found in the subject contracts is indeed restrictive in nature, considering that it effectively limits the venue of the actions arising therefrom to the courts of Makati City. However, it must be emphasized that Briones\u2019s complaint directly assails the validity of the subject contracts, claiming forgery in their execution. Given this circumstance, Briones cannot be expected to comply with the aforesaid venue stipulation, as his compliance therewith would mean an implicit recognition of their validity. Hence, pursuant to the general rules on venue, Briones properly filed his complaint before a court in the City of Manila where the subject property is located.\n\nIn conclusion, the CA patently erred and hence committed grave abuse of discretion in dismissing Briones\u2019s complaint on the ground of improper venue.\n\nWHEREFORE , the petition is GRANTED. Accordingly, the Decision dated March 5, 2012 and the Resolution dated October 4, 2012 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 117474 are hereby ANNULLED and SET ASIDE.

JAYLO, WILLIAM VALENZONA AND ANTONIO G. HABALO, PETITIONERS, VS. SANDIGANBAYAN (FIRST DIVISION), PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES AND HEIRS OF COL. ROLANDO DE GUZMAN, FRANCO CALANOG AND AVELINO MANGUERA, RESPONDENTS.\n\nD E C I S I O N\n\nSERENO, C.J.:\n\nWhat are the repercussions of the failure of the accused to appear, without justifiable cause, at the promulgation of a judgment of conviction? With the resolution of this singular issue, the Court writes finis to the 24-year-old controversy before us.\n\nAssailed in this Petition for Review on Certiorari under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court is the Decision [1] of the Sandiganbayan finding petitioners guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of homicide. Petitioners also challenge the Resolution dated 29 November 2007 [2] issued by the same court, which took no action on the motion for reconsideration filed by petitioners, and the Resolution dated 26 May 2008 [3] denying the motion for reconsideration of the earlier Resolution.\n\nANTECEDENT FACTS\n\nPetitioners Reynaldo Jaylo (Jaylo), William Valenzona (Valenzona) and Antonio Habalo (Habalo), together with Edgardo Castro (Castro), [4] were officers of the Philippine National Police Western Police District placed on special detail with the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI). [5]\n\nIn June of 1990, the United States Drug Enforcement Agency (US DEA) approached the NBI with information on the sale of a considerable amount of heroin in the Philippines. Jaylo was assigned by then NBI Director Alfredo Lim to head the team that would conduct a buy-bust operation with the aid of US DEA undercover agent Philip Needham (Needham).\n\nFrom 3 to 8 July 1990, Needham, posing as a member of an international drug syndicate, conducted negotiations for the purchase of 10 kilos of heroin from Estella Arrastia (Arrastia), Franco Calanog (Calanog) and Rolando De Guzman (De Guzman). The exchange was scheduled on the evening of 10 July 1990 at the parking lot of the Magallanes Commercial Center.\n\nNeedham arrived at the parking lot on board a taxicab with Arrastia and Philip Manila (Manila), an undercover NBI operative who posed as Needham\u2019s bodyguard. [6] The taxicab was driven by Romeo Noriega (Noriega), another undercover NBI operative. [7]\n\nAt the parking lot, Needham and Arrastia met Calanog and Avelino Manguera (Manguera), who both alighted from a blue Volkswagen Beetle; and De Guzman, who alighted from a brown Saab. [8] Needham approached the Volkswagen and examined the heroin in the backseat. [9] After some time, he straightened up and walked back towards the taxicab, while executing the prearranged signal of taking out his handkerchief and blowing his nose. [10]\n\nIt is at this point that the versions of the prosecution and the defense diverged, particularly on the manner of the arrest.\n\nVersion of the Prosecution\n\nOn board two vehicles, Jaylo, Castro, Valenzona, Habalo, and at least 15 other operatives, rushed in and surrounded De Guzman, Calanog, and Manguera. [11]\n\nJaylo pointed his gun at De Guzman. Two other operatives instructed Calanog and Manguera to lie face down on the ground and placed a foot on their backs while training a gun at them. The rest cordoned the area.\n\nLater, a car with passengers Needham, US DEA country attach\u00e9 Andrew Fenrich (Fenrich), and two armed bodyguards moved out of the cordoned area. When the car was safely on its way, Jaylo and his men shot De Guzman, Calanog, and Manguera. They waited 15 minutes for the victims to bleed out and thereafter loaded them into the vehicles under the ruse of bringing them to the hospital. [12]\n\nVersion of the Defense\n\nWhen he saw Needham executing the prearranged signal, Manila executed the second signal of wiping the right side of his face as confirmation. [13]\n\nCastro, who was driving a Lancer car with Jaylo as his passenger, stepped on the accelerator to block the path of the Volkswagen. [14] Both of them immediately alighted from the vehicle. Jaylo confronted De Guzman in the Saab, while Castro arrested Calanog in the Volkswagen. Meanwhile, Valenzona and Habalo approached Manguera. [15]\n\nA speeding blue-green car and a burst of gunfire caught the attention of the operatives while they were approaching their quarries. [16] Taking advantage of the distraction, De Guzman, Calanog, and Manguera reached for their firearms and tried to shoot.\n\nJaylo was able to move away, so only the window on the driver\u2019s side of the Saab was hit and shattered. [17] He retaliated and shot De Guzman twice, hitting him in the left eye and chest. [18]\n\nOut of instinct, Castro shoved the gun of Calanog upward and shot him twice. [19] Calanog staggered, but again aimed the gun at him. It was then that Castro shot Calanog two times more, causing the latter to finally fall down.\n\nValenzona and Habalo saw Manguera in the act of drawing his firearm. [20] Both of them fired and hit him.\n\nThe operatives brought De Guzman, Calanog, and Manguera to the hospital. [21] Upon verifying their identities, the victims were found to be soldiers: Colonel Rolando de Guzman and Major Franco Calanog. [22] Manguera was the driver/security aide of Major Calanog. [23]\n\nThe Elma Committee\n\nPresident Corazon Aquino issued Administrative Order No. 182 [24] on 13 July 1990 creating the \u201cElma Committee.\u201d Headed by Presidential Assistant for Legal and Judicial Affairs Magdangal Elma, with Undersecretary of National Defense Leonardo Quisumbing and Undersecretary of Justice Eduardo Montenegro as members, the Elma Committee was tasked to conduct an investigation of all the facts and circumstances surrounding the seizure of heroin and the shooting incident.\n\nPursuant to its mandate to submit its findings and recommendations to the President after the completion of its investigation, the Elma Committee recommended the prosecution of Jaylo for the killing of De Guzman, Castro for that of Calanog, and Valenzona and Habalo for that of Manguera. [25]\n\nHowever, in three separate Amended Informations dated 8 September 1992 and filed before the Sandiganbayan, Jaylo, Castro, Valenzona and Habalo, together with several John Does, were charged with conspiracy in the murder of De Guzman, [26] Calanog, [27] and Manguera. [28]\n\nRuling of the Sandiganbayan\n\nIn a Decision dated 17 April 2007, the Sandiganbayan found Jaylo, Castro, Valenzona, and Habalo guilty of homicide. Jaylo was convicted for the killing of De Guzman under Criminal Case No. 17984; Castro for that of Calanog under Criminal Case No. 17985; and Valenzona and Habalo for Manguera\u2019s under Criminal Case No. 17986. [29] Each of the accused was sentenced to imprisonment of six years and one day of prision mayor as minimum to 14 years, eight months and one day of reclusion temporal as maximum, and perpetual disqualification from public office. Each was likewise ordered to pay P50,000 as damages to the heirs of their respective victims, and a proportionate share in the costs of suit.\n\nThe Sandiganbayan noted that the prosecution and the defense were in agreement that the four accused shot and killed the three victims. [30] With this established fact, it was only necessary to determine the following:\n\n[TABLE_CONTENT]\na) | Whether the accused conspired to kill the victims;\nb) | Whether the killing was attended by treachery, evident premeditation and taking advantage of superior strength; and\nc) | Whether the killing was justified by the circumstance of fulfillment of duty or lawful exercise of a right or office.\n[END_TABLE]\n\na) Whether the accused conspired to kill the victims; b) Whether the killing was attended by treachery, evident premeditation and taking advantage of superior strength; and c) Whether the killing was justified by the circumstance of fulfillment of duty or lawful exercise of a right or office.\nAccording to the Sandiganbayan, the evidence presented did not show conspiracy or any intention on the part of the four accused to aid one another in the shooting. [31] They did not demonstrate a preconceived common plan or scheme to liquidate the suspected drug dealers.\n\nThe prosecution was also unable to prove the attendance of any of the qualifying circumstances. [32] Treachery was not established. The Sandiganbayan ruled that it could not take judicial notice of the statements given before the Elma Committee by Dr. Desiderio Moraleda, who had conducted the autopsy on the victims. Dr. Moraleda died before he could testify before the Sandiganbayan, and his testimony on the trajectory of the bullets and the positions of the assailants relative to those of the victims could not be admitted in evidence without violating the rules on hearsay evidence.\n\nOn the allegation that the four accused took advantage of superior strength, the court ruled that there was no evidence showing the use of excessive force out of proportion to the defense available to the victims. In particular, the shooting of Manguera by Valenzona and Habalo only showed numerical superiority, not superior strength.\n\nThe prosecution also failed to prove evident premeditation. It was not able to indicate the time when the four accused determined to commit the killing; neither was it able to pinpoint the overt act demonstrating that they adhered to their resolve to commit the crime even after the lapse of enough time \u201cto allow their conscience to overcome the resolution of their will.\u201d [33]\n\nFor their part, the accused also failed to prove their defense of fulfillment of a duty or lawful exercise of a right or office. [34] The Sandiganbayan was not convinced that they had acted within the bounds allowed for an arrest in a buy-bust operation.\n\nFor one, the Sandiganbayan highly doubted the existence of the speeding car that distracted the operatives while they were arresting the suspected drug dealers. In this regard, it took note of the inconsistent testimonies of Manila and Noriega on one hand and of Needham on the other.\n\nAccording to Manila, when he heard the gunfire from the speeding car, he covered Needham and ran with him towards the South Superhighway, away from the taxicab driven by Noriega. [35] Needham got into the diplomatic car that approached them. When the shooting subsided, he went back to the scene.\n\nAccording to Noriega, he saw the speeding car going towards the Maranaw Building parking lot and heard three gunshots. Thereafter, he saw Needham run towards his taxi and board it. While Noriega was trying to get Needham away from the area, a diplomatic car blocked their taxicab, and the latter transferred to that car.\n\nAccording to Needham, however, he immediately walked back to the taxi after executing the prearranged signal for the arrest, got in the cab and left the scene. As the taxicab was leaving, he saw the \u201crescue\u201d coming in. [36] Other than that, he did not notice any commotion or gunfire. He was then picked up by Fenrich, and they went on their way.\n\nThe Sandiganbayan also noted that the slugs or shells recovered from the scene all came from short firearms, contrary to Jaylo\u2019s testimony that the shots from the speeding car were from a rifle (an \u201carmalite\u201d).\n\nFurther militating against the existence of the speeding car was Jaylo\u2019s incident Report dated 10 July 1990, in which he stated that when they rushed in for the arrest, they were met by a volley of gunfire from the three cars of the suspected drug dealers. [37] There was no mention at all of any speeding car.\n\nConsidering the failure of the prosecution to prove conspiracy and the attendance of any of the alleged qualifying circumstances, as well as the failure of the defense to prove the justifying circumstance of fulfillment of a duty or lawful exercise of a right or office, the Sandiganbayan ruled that the crime committed was homicide.\n\nDuring the promulgation of the Sandiganbayan\u2019s judgment on\u00a0\u00a0 17 April 2007, none of the accused appeared despite notice. [38] The court promulgated the Decision in absentia, and the judgment was entered in the criminal docket. The bail bonds of the accused were cancelled, and warrants for their arrest issued.\n\nOn 30 April 2007, counsel for Jaylo, Valenzona, and Habalo filed a Motion for Partial Reconsideration [39] of the Decision. In the assailed Resolution dated 29 November 2007, the Sandiganbayan took no action on the motion and ordered the implementation of the warrants for the arrest of the convicted accused. [40] The court ruled that the 15-day period from the promulgation of the judgment had long lapsed without any of the accused giving any justifiable cause for their absence during the promulgation. Under Section 6 of Rule 120 of the Rules of Court, [41] Jaylo, Valenzona and Habalo have lost the remedies available under the Rules against the Sandiganbayan\u2019s judgment of conviction, including the filing of a motion for reconsideration.\n\nIn an Ad Cautelam Motion for Reconsideration [42] dated 25 January 2008, counsel for the three urged the Sandiganbayan to give due course to and resolve the Motion for Partial Reconsideration. The Sandiganbayan issued the second assailed Resolution dated 26 May 2008. The court ruled that for the failure of the three to surrender and move for leave to avail themselves of a motion for reconsideration within 15 days from the date of promulgation, the judgment has become final and executory, and no action on the motion for reconsideration can be taken. [43] It then reiterated its order to implement the warrants for the arrest of the three.\n\nISSUE\n\nOn 19 June 2008, petitioners Jaylo, Valenzona and Habalo, by counsel, filed the instant petition assailing the Sandiganbayan Decision dated 17 April 2007 and Resolutions dated 29 November 2007 and 26 May 2008. Regarding the Decision dated 17 April 2007, petitioners argue that the Sandiganbayan erred in ruling as follows:\n\nThe negative finding of a conspiracy did not lead to the positive finding of the justifying circumstance of fulfillment of duty.\nThere was a contradiction between the testimonies of Manila and Noriega on one hand and Needham on the other.\nThe existence of the speeding car was highly doubtful.\nThe inconsistency in the testimony of Jaylo was determinative of his lack of credibility.\nThere should be conclusive physical evidence to prove the justifying circumstance of fulfillment of duty.\nThe admissions of petitioners before the Elma Committee were admissible in evidence.\nPetitioners are guilty of homicide even in the absence of their positive identification as the ones who committed the crimes charged.\n\nAnent the Resolutions dated 29 November 2007 and 26 May 2008, petitioners argue:\n\nSection 6 of Rule 120 of the Rules of Court cannot diminish, increase or modify substantive rights like the filing of a motion for reconsideration provided under Presidential Decree No. (P.D.) 1606. [44]\nThe conditions under Section 6 Rule 120 of the Rules of Court do not obtain in the instant case.\nAs stated at the outset, the resolution of the instant case hinges on the question regarding the effects of the nonappearance of the accused, without justifiable cause, in the promulgation of the judgment of conviction. In the interest of judicial economy, we shall proceed with a discussion on this question. For reasons that will be expounded on below, the application in this case of the law and rules on the nonappearance of the accused, without justifiable cause, in the promulgation of the judgment of conviction shall determine for us the propriety of conducting a review of the Sandiganbayan Decision dated 17 April 2007.\n\nOUR RULING\n\nSection 6, Rule 120, of the Rules of Court\nprovides that an accused who failed to\nappear at the promulgation of the judgment\nof conviction shall lose the remedies available\nagainst the said judgment.\n\nSection 6, Rule 120, of the Rules of Court states:\n\nSECTION 6. Promulgation of judgment. \u2014 The judgment is promulgated by reading it in the presence of the accused and any judge of the court in which it was rendered. However, if the conviction is for a light offense, the judgment may be pronounced in the presence of his counsel or representative. When the judge is absent or outside the province or city, the judgment may be promulgated by the clerk of court.\n\nIf the accused is confined or detained in another province or city, the judgment may be promulgated by the executive judge of the Regional Trial Court having jurisdiction over the place of confinement or detention upon request of the court which rendered the judgment. The court promulgating the judgment shall have authority to accept the notice of appeal and to approve the bail bond pending appeal; provided, that if the decision of the trial court convicting the accused changed the nature of the offense from non-bailable to bailable, the application for bail can only be filed and resolved by the appellate court.\n\nThe proper clerk of court shall give notice to the accused personally or through his bondsman or warden and counsel, requiring him to be present at the promulgation of the decision. If the accused was tried in absentia because he jumped bail or escaped from prison, the notice to him shall be served at his last known address.\n\nIn case the accused fails to appear at the scheduled date of promulgation of judgment despite notice, the promulgation shall be made by recording the judgment in the criminal docket and serving him a copy thereof at his last known address or thru his counsel.\n\nIf the judgment is for conviction and the failure of the accused to appear was without justifiable cause, he shall lose the remedies available in these rules against the judgment and the court shall order his arrest. Within fifteen (15) days from promulgation of judgment, however, the accused may surrender and file a motion for leave of court to avail of these remedies. He shall state the reasons for his absence at the scheduled promulgation and if he proves that his absence was for a justifiable cause, he shall be allowed to avail of said remedies within fifteen (15) days from notice. (6a) (Emphasis supplied)\nExcept when the conviction is for a light offense, in which case the judgment may be pronounced in the presence of the counsel for the accused or the latter\u2019s representative, the accused is required to be present at the scheduled date of promulgation of judgment. Notice of the schedule of promulgation shall be made to the accused personally or through the bondsman or warden and counsel.\n\nThe promulgation of judgment shall proceed even in the absence of the accused despite notice. The promulgation in absentia shall be made by recording the judgment in the criminal docket and serving a copy thereof to the accused at their last known address or through counsel. The court shall also order the arrest of the accused if the judgment is for conviction and the failure to appear was without justifiable cause. [45]\n\nIf the judgment is for conviction and the failure to appear was without justifiable cause, the accused shall lose the remedies available in the Rules of Court against the judgment. Thus, it is incumbent upon the accused to appear on the scheduled date of promulgation, because it determines the availability of their possible remedies against the judgment of conviction. When the accused fail to present themselves at the promulgation of the judgment of conviction, they lose the remedies of filing a motion for a new trial or reconsideration (Rule 121) and an appeal from the judgment of conviction (Rule 122). [46]\n\nThe reason is simple. When the accused on bail fail to present themselves at the promulgation of a judgment of conviction, they are considered to have lost their standing in court. [47] Without any standing in court, the accused cannot invoke its jurisdiction to seek relief. [48]\n\nSection 6, Rule 120, of the Rules of Court,\ndoes not take away substantive rights; it\nmerely provides the manner through which\nan existing right may be implemented.\n\nPetitioners claim that their right to file a motion for reconsideration or an appeal has a statutory origin, as provided under Section 7 of P.D. 1606, to wit:\n\nSection 7. Form, Finality and Enforcement of Decisions. \u2014 All decisions and final orders determining the merits of a case or finally disposing of the action or proceedings of the Sandiganbayan shall contain complete findings of the facts and the law on which they are based, on all issues properly raised before it and necessary in deciding the case.\n\nA petition for reconsideration of any final order or decision may be filed within fifteen (15) days from promulgation or notice of the final order or judgment, and such motion for reconsideration shall be decided within thirty (30) days from submission thereon. (Emphasis supplied)\n\nx x x x\n\nAccording to petitioners, Section 7 of P.D. 1606 did not provide for any situation as to when the right to file a motion for reconsideration may be deemed lost. Thus, it is available at all times and the Rules promulgated by the Supreme Court cannot operate to diminish or modify the right of a convicted accused to file a motion for reconsideration. [49] Furthermore, they argue, the right to file a motion for reconsideration is a statutory grant, and not merely a remedy \u201cavailable in [the] Rules,\u201d as provided under Section 6 of Rule 120 of the Rules of Court. Thus, according to them, their absence at the promulgation of judgment before the Sandiganbayan cannot be deemed to have resulted in the loss of their right to file a motion for reconsideration.\n\nPetitioners\u2019 argument lacks merit.\n\nLike an appeal, the right to file a motion for reconsideration is a statutory grant or privilege. As a statutory right, the filing of a motion for reconsideration is to be exercised in accordance with and in the manner provided by law. Thus, a party filing a motion for reconsideration must strictly comply with the requisites laid down in the Rules of Court. [50]\n\nIt bears stressing that the provision on which petitioners base their claim states that \u201c[a] petition for reconsideration of any final order or decision may be filed within fifteen (15) days from promulgation or notice of the final order or judgment.\u201d [51] In Social Security Commission v. Court of Appeals , [52] we enunciated that the term \u201cmay\u201d denotes a mere possibility, an opportunity, or an option. Those granted this opportunity may choose to exercise it or not. If they do, they must comply with the conditions attached thereto. [53]\n\nAside from the condition that a motion for reconsideration must be filed within 15 days from the promulgation or notice of the judgment, the movant must also comply with the conditions laid down in the Rules of Court, which applies to all cases and proceedings filed with the Sandiganbayan. [54]\n\nPetitioners insist that the right to file a motion for reconsideration under Section 7 of P.D. 1606 is a guarantee, and no amount of Rules promulgated by the Supreme Court can operate to diminish or modify this substantive right. Aptly citing Fabian v. Desierto, [55] the Sandiganbayan was correct in rejecting the argument of petitioners in this wise:\n\nFabian v. Desierto lays down the test for determining whether a rule prescribed by the Supreme Court, for the practice and procedure of the lower courts, abridges, enlarges or modifies any substantive right, to wit:\n\u201c\u2026whether the rule really regulates procedure, that is, the judicial process for enforcing rights and duties recognized by substantive law and for justly determining remedy and redress for a disregard or infraction of them. If the rule takes away a vested right, it is not procedural. If the rule creates a right such as the right to appeal, it may be classified as a substantive matter; but if it operates as a means of implementing an existing right then the rule deals merely with procedure . Applying the Fabian v. Desierto test, it appears indubitable that Section 6, Rule 120 of the Rules of Court (ROC) clearly applies to the Sandiganbayan.\n\nSection 6, Rule 120, ROC as well as Section 4, Rule VIII of the Revised Rules of the Sandiganbayan (which makes applicable Section 6, Rule 120, ROC when the accused is absent during promulgation of judgment) merely regulates the right to file a motion for reconsideration under P.D. 1606. These are mere rules of procedure which the Supreme Court is competent to adopt pursuant to its rule-making power under Article VIII, Section 5(5) of the Constitution. And, contrary to the view espoused by the accused, said rules do not take away, repeal or alter the right to file a motion for reconsideration as said right still exists. The Supreme Court merely laid down the rules on promulgation of a judgment of conviction done in absentia in cases when the accused fails to surrender and explain his absence within 15 days from promulgation. The Supreme Court can very well do this as the right to file a motion for reconsideration under P.D. 1606 is not preclusive in character. Indeed, there is nothing in P.D. 1606 which prevents the Supreme Court from regulating the procedure for promulgation of decisions in criminal cases done in absentia . [56]\n\nSection 6, Rule 120, of the Rules of Court, does not take away per se the right of the convicted accused to avail of the remedies under the Rules. It is the failure of the accused to appear without justifiable cause on the scheduled date of promulgation of the judgment of conviction that forfeits their right to avail themselves of the remedies against the judgment.\n\nIt is not correct to say that Section 6, Rule 120, of the Rules of Court diminishes or modifies the substantive rights of petitioners. It only works in pursuance of the power of the Supreme Court to \u201cprovide a simplified and inexpensive procedure for the speedy disposition of cases.\u201d [57] This provision protects the courts from delay in the speedy disposition of criminal cases \u2013 delay arising from the simple expediency of nonappearance of the accused on the scheduled promulgation of the judgment of conviction.\n\nIn this case, petitioners have just shown their lack of faith in the jurisdiction of the Sandiganbayan by not appearing before it for the promulgation of the judgment on their cases. Surely they cannot later on expect to be allowed to invoke the Sandiganbayan\u2019s jurisdiction to grant them relief from its judgment of conviction.\n\nIt is incumbent upon the accused to show\njustifiable cause for their absence at the\npromulgation of the judgment of conviction.\n\nAccording to petitioners, even if we were to apply Section 6, Rule 120, the conditions under which an accused loses the remedies available in the Rules of Court do not obtain in this case. It is argued that for the provision to apply, it must be shown that 1) the accused was notified of the scheduled date of promulgation, and that 2) the accused failed to appear at the promulgation of the judgment of conviction without justifiable cause.\n\nPetitioners insist that the Sandiganbayan did not bother to determine whether their absence at the promulgation of judgment was without justifiable cause. In other words, as petitioners would have it, it was incumbent upon the Sandiganbayan to take pains to find out whether their absence at the promulgation was without justifiable cause, and only then could the court conclude that petitioners have lost the remedies available in the Rules of Court against the judgment of conviction.\n\nIt is well to note that Section 6, Rule 120, of the Rules of Court also provides the remedy by which the accused who were absent during the promulgation may reverse the forfeiture of the remedies available to them against the judgment of conviction. In order to regain their standing in court, the accused must do as follows: 1) surrender and 2) file a motion for leave of court to avail of the remedies, stating the reasons for their absence, within 15 days from the date of the promulgation of judgment. [58]\n\nIn Villena v. People, [59] we stated that the term \u201csurrender\u201d contemplates the act by the convicted accused of physically and voluntarily submitting themselves to the jurisdiction of the court to suffer the consequences of the judgment against them. Upon surrender, the accused must request permission of the court to avail of the remedies by making clear the reasons for their failure to attend the promulgation of the judgment of conviction.\n\nClearly, the convicted accused are the ones who should show that their reason for being absent at the promulgation of judgment was justifiable. If the court finds that the reasons proffered justify their nonappearance during the promulgation of judgment, it shall allow them to avail of the remedies. [60] Thus, unless they surrender and prove their justifiable reason to the satisfaction of the court, their absence is presumed to be unjustified.\n\nOn the scheduled date of promulgation on 17 April 2007, the Sandiganbayan noted that only Atty. Francisco Chavez, counsel for petitioners, appeared. [61] Jaylo was not served notice of the promulgation, because he was no longer residing at his given address. Valenzona and Habalo were duly notified. Castro had died on 22 December 2006. [62]\n\nPetitioners did not surrender within 15 days from the promulgation of the judgment of conviction. Neither did they ask for leave of court to avail themselves of the remedies, and state the reasons for their absence. Even if we were to assume that the failure of Jaylo to appear at the promulgation was due to failure to receive notice thereof, it is not a justifiable reason. He should have filed a notice of change of address before the Sandiganbayan.\n\nThe Sandiganbayan was correct in not taking cognizance of the Motion for Partial Reconsideration filed by counsel for petitioners. While the motion was filed on 30 April 2007, it did not operate to regain the standing of petitioners in court. For one, it is not an act of surrender that is contemplated by Section 6, Rule 120, of the Rules of Court. Moreover, nowhere in the Motion for Partial Reconsideration was it indicated that petitioners were asking for leave to avail of the remedies against the judgment of conviction, or that there were valid reasons for their absence at the promulgation.\n\nFor the failure of petitioners to regain their standing in court and avail themselves of the remedies against the judgment of conviction, the Decision of the Sandiganbayan attained finality 15 days reckoned from 17 April 2007.\n\nIn view thereof, this Court no longer has the power to conduct a review of the findings and conclusions in the Decision of the Sandiganbayan. The Decision is no longer subject to change, revision, amendment, or reversal. [63] Thus, there is no need to pass upon the issues raised by petitioners assailing it.\n\nWHEREFORE , the petition is DENIED. The Sandiganbayan Resolutions dated 29 November 2007 and 26 May 2008 in Criminal Case Nos. 17984-86 are AFFIRMED .

When the judge is absent or outside the province or city, the judgment may be promulgated by the clerk of court.\n\nIf the accused is confined or detained in another province or city, the judgment may be promulgated by the executive judge of the Regional Trial Court having jurisdiction over the place of confinement or detention upon request of the court which rendered the judgment. The court promulgating the judgment shall have authority to accept the notice of appeal and to approve the bail bond pending appeal; provided, that if the decision of the trial court convicting the accused changed the nature of the offense from non-bailable to bailable, the application for bail can only be filed and resolved by the appellate court.\n\nThe proper clerk of court shall give notice to the accused personally or through his bondsman or warden and counsel, requiring him to be present at the promulgation of the decision. If the accused was tried in absentia because he jumped bail or escaped from prison, the notice to him shall be served at his last known address.\n\nIn case the accused fails to appear at the scheduled date of promulgation of judgment despite notice, the promulgation shall be made by recording the judgment in the criminal docket and serving him a copy thereof at his last known address or thru his counsel.\n\nIf the judgment is for conviction and the failure of the accused to appear was without justifiable cause, he shall lose the remedies available in these rules against the judgment and the court shall order his arrest. Within fifteen (15) days from promulgation of judgment, however, the accused may surrender and file a motion for leave of court to avail of these remedies. He shall state the reasons for his absence at the scheduled promulgation and if he proves that his absence was for a justifiable cause, he shall be allowed to avail of said remedies within fifteen (15) days from notice.

      "title": "AUGUSTO M. AQUINO, PETITIONER, VS. HON. ISMAEL P. CASABAR, AS PRESIDING JUDGE REGIONAL TRIAL COURT-GUIMBA, NUEVA ECIJA, BRANCH 33 AND MA. ALA F. DOMINGO AND MARGARITA IRENE F. DOMINGO, SUBSTITUTING HEIRS OF THE DECEASED ANGEL T. DOMINGO, RESPONDENTS.D E C I S I O N PERALTA, J.: Before us is a special civil action for certiorari[1] under Rule 65 of the Rules of Court, dated March 17, 2010, filed by Atty. Augusto M. Aquino (petitioner) assailing the Order dated January 11, 2010 issued by respondent Presiding Judge Ismael P. Casabar (public respondent), in relation to Agrarian Case No. 1217-G,[2] for allegedly having been issued with grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction.The facts of the case, as culled from the records, are as follows:On June 27, 2002, Atty. Angel T. Domingo (now deceased) verbally contracted petitioner to represent him in Agrarian Case No. 1217-G on a contingency fee basis. The case was for the determination of the just compensation for the expropriation and taking of Atty. Domingo's ricelands consisting of 60.5348 hectares, situated in Guimba, Nueva Ecija, by the Department of Agrarian Reform (DAR), pursuant to Presidential Decree (P.D.) 27. The DAR and the Land Bank of the Philippines (Land Bank) initially valued Atty. Domingo's property at P484,236.27 or P7,999.30 per hectare, which the latter, through petitioner-counsel, opposed in courts.Eventually, the RTC, acting as Special Agrarian Court (RTC/SAC) issued a Decision dated April 12, 2004 fixing the just compensation for Atty. Domingo's property at P2,459,319.70 or P40,626.54 per hectare, or an increase of P1,975,083.43 over the initial DAR and the Land Bank valuation. Land Bank moved for reconsideration, but was denied, thus, it filed a petition for review docketed as CA-G.R. SP No. 85394. However, in a Decision dated June 12, 2007, the appellate court affirmed in toto the SAC Decision dated April 12, 2004. Land Bank moved for reconsideration anew, but was denied.Meanwhile, on September 30, 2007, Atty. Domingo died. Petitioner filed a Manifestation dated December 11, 2007 of the fact of Atty. Domingo's death and the substitution of the latter by his legal heirs, Ma. Ala F. Domingo and Margarita Irene F. Domingo (private respondents).Land Bank assailed the appellate court's decision and resolution before the Supreme Court via a petition for review on certiorari dated December 4, 2007 docketed as G.R. No. 180108 entitled \u201cLand Bank of the Philippines vs. Angel T. Domingo\u201d. However, in a Resolution dated September 17, 2008, the Court denied the same for failure to sufficiently show any reversible error in the appellate court's decision. On December 15, 2008, the Court denied with finality Land Bank's motion for reconsideration.On February 11, 2009,[3] petitioner wrote private respondent Ma. Ala Domingo and informed her of the finality of the RTC/SAC decision as affirmed by the Court of Appeals and the Supreme Court. He then requested her to inform the Land Bank of the segregation of petitioner's thirty percent (30%) contingent attorney's fees out of the increase of the just compensation for the subject property, or thirty percent (30%) of the total increase amounting to Php1,975,983.43. Petitioner claimed never to have received a reply from private respondent.On March 30, 2009, petitioner received a copy of the entry of judgment from this Court certifying that its Resolution dated September 17, 2008 in G.R. No. 180108 has already become final and executory on March 3, 2009.On July 28, 2009, petitioner received a Notice of Appearance dated July 16, 2009 filed by Atty. Antonio G. Conde, entering his appearance as counsel of herein private respondents and replacing him as counsel in Agrarian Case No. 1217-G.On August 14, 2009, private respondents, through their new counsel, Atty. Conde, filed a Motion for Execution dated August 6, 2009 of the RTC/SAC Decision dated April 12, 2004.On August 12, 2009, petitioner filed a Motion for Approval of Charging Attorney's Lien and for the Order of Payment.[4] Petitioner further executed an Affidavit[5] dated August 10, 2009, attesting to the circumstances surrounding the legal services he has rendered for the deceased Atty. Domingo and the successful prosecution of the Agrarian case from the RTC/SAC through the appellate court and the Supreme Court.On August 18, 2009, private respondents filed a Motion to Dismiss/Expunge Petitioner's Motion.[6] Public respondent Presiding Judge Casabar denied the same.[7] Private respondents moved for reconsideration.On January 11, 2010, public respondent Judge Casabar issued the disputed Order denying petitioner's motion for approval of attorney's lien, the dispositive portion of which reads:x x x xExamining the basis of the instant motion for reconsideration, this court agrees with respondents \u2013 movants that this court has no jurisdiction over Atty. Aquino's motion for approval of charging (Attorney's) lien having been filed after the judgment has become final and executory. Accordingly, the motion for reconsideration is granted and the motion for approval of (Attorney's) lien is denied and or expunged from the records of the case.SO ORDERED.On the same day, January 11, 2010, public respondent issued an Order directing the issuance of a Writ of Execution of the RTC/SAC Decision dated April 12, 2004.On January 12, 2010, the Clerk of Court of Branch 33, RTC of Guimba, Nueva Ecija, issued a Writ of Execution of the April 12, 2004. On January 15, 2010, the Sheriff of the RTC of Guimba, Nueva Ecija issued a Notice of Garnishment.Thus, the instant petition for certiorari via Rule 65, raising the following issues:IWHETHER OR NOT A CHARGING (ATTORNEY'S) LIEN CAN EFFECTIVELY BE FILED ONLY BEFORE JUDGMENT IS RENDERED.IIWHETHER OR NOT RESPONDENT PRESIDING JUDGE HAS THE JURISDICTION TO TAKE COGNIZANCE OVER PETITIONER'S MOTION FOR APPROVAL OF CHARGING (ATTORNEY'S) LIEN FILED AFTER THE JUDGMENT HAS BECOME FINAL AND EXECUTORY.IIIWHETHER OR NOT THE RESPONDENT PRESIDING JUDGE ACTED WITH GRAVE ABUSE OF DISCRETION IN ISSUING THE CHALLENGED ORDER.[8]Petitioner maintains that he filed the motion for charging attorney's lien and order of payment in the very same case, Agrarian Case No. 1217-G, as an incident thereof, wherein he was the counsel during the proceedings of the latter, and that he is allowed to wait until the finality of the case to file the said motion.Private respondents, on the other hand, counter that the motion was belatedly filed and that it was filed without the payment of docket fees, thus, the court a quo did not acquire jurisdiction over the case.RULINGIn a nutshell, the issue is whether the trial court committed a reversible error in denying the motion to approve attorney's lien and order of payment on the ground that it lost jurisdiction over the case since judgment in the case has already become final and executory.We rule in favor of the petitioner.In the case of Rosario, Jr. v. De Guzman,[9] the Court clarified a similar issue and discussed the two concepts of attorney\u2019s fees \u2013 that is, ordinary and extraordinary. In its ordinary sense, it is the reasonable compensation paid to a lawyer by his client for legal services rendered. In its extraordinary concept, it is awarded by the court to the successful litigant to be paid by the losing party as indemnity for damages.[10] Although both concepts are similar in some respects, they differ from each other, as further explained below:The attorney\u2019s fees which a court may, in proper cases, award to a winning litigant is, strictly speaking, an item of damages. It differs from that which a client pays his counsel for the latter\u2019s professional services. However, the two concepts have many things in common that a treatment of the subject is necessary. The award that the court may grant to a successful party by way of attorney\u2019s fee is an indemnity for damages sustained by him in prosecuting or defending, through counsel, his cause in court. It may be decreed in favor of the party, not his lawyer, in any of the instances authorized by law. On the other hand, the attorney\u2019s fee which a client pays his counsel refers to the compensation for the latter\u2019s services. The losing party against whom damages by way of attorney\u2019s fees may be assessed is not bound by, nor is his liability dependent upon, the fee arrangement of the prevailing party with his lawyer. The amount stipulated in such fee arrangement may, however, be taken into account by the court in fixing the amount of counsel fees as an element of damages.The fee as an item of damages belongs to the party litigant and not to his lawyer. It forms part of his judgment recoveries against the losing party. The client and his lawyer may, however, agree that whatever attorney\u2019s fee as an element of damages the court may award shall pertain to the lawyer as his compensation or as part thereof. In such a case, the court upon proper motion may require the losing party to pay such fee directly to the lawyer of the prevailing party.The two concepts of attorney\u2019s fees are similar in other respects. They both require, as a prerequisite to their grant, the intervention of or the rendition of professional services by a lawyer. As a client may not be held liable for counsel fees in favor of his lawyer who never rendered services, so too may a party be not held liable for attorney\u2019s fees as damages in favor of the winning party who enforced his rights without the assistance of counsel. Moreover, both fees are subject to judicial control and modification. And the rules governing the determination of their reasonable amount are applicable in one as in the other.[11]Similarly, in the instant case, the attorney\u2019s fees being claimed by the petitioner is the compensation for professional services rendered, and not an indemnity for damages. Petitioner is claiming payment from private respondents for the successful outcome of the agrarian case which he represented. We see no valid reason why public respondent cannot pass upon a proper petition to determine attorney's fees considering that it is already familiar with the nature and the extent of petitioner's legal services. If we are to follow the rule against multiplicity of suits, then with more reason that petitioner's motion should not be dismissed as the same is in effect incidental to the main case.We are, likewise, unconvinced that the court a quo did not acquire jurisdiction over the motion solely due to non-payment of docket fees. Petitioner's failure to pay the docket fees pertinent to his motion should not be considered as having divested the court a quo's jurisdiction. We note that, in this case, there was no showing that petitioner intended to evade the payment of docket fees as in fact he manifested willingness to pay the same should it be necessary.[12]Likewise, pursuant to the ruling in Sun Insurance Office, Ltd. (SIOL) v. Asuncion, should there be unpaid docket fees, the same should be considered as a lien on the judgment. Thus, even on the assumption that additional docket fees are required as a consequence of petitioner's motion, its non-payment will not result in the court\u2019s loss of jurisdiction over the case.[13]With regards to how attorney\u2019s fees for professional services can be recovered, and when an action for attorney\u2019s fees for professional services can be filed, the case of Traders Royal Bank Employees Union-Independent v. NLRC[14] is instructive:x x x It is well settled that a claim for attorney\u2019s fees may be asserted either in the very action in which the services of a lawyer had been rendered or in a separate action.With respect to the first situation, the remedy for recovering attorney\u2019s fees as an incident of the main action may be availed of only when something is due to the client. Attorney\u2019s fees cannot be determined until after the main litigation has been decided and the subject of the recovery is at the disposition of the court. The issue over attorney\u2019s fees only arises when something has been recovered from which the fee is to be paid.While a claim for attorney\u2019s fees may be filed before the judgment is rendered, the determination as to the propriety of the fees or as to the amount thereof will have to be held in abeyance until the main case from which the lawyer\u2019s claim for attorney\u2019s fees may arise has become final. Otherwise, the determination to be made by the courts will be premature. Of course, a petition for attorney\u2019s fees may be filed before the judgment in favor of the client is satisfied or the proceeds thereof delivered to the client.It is apparent from the foregoing discussion that a lawyer has two options as to when to file his claim for professional fees. Hence, private respondent was well within his rights when he made his claim and waited for the finality of the judgment for holiday pay differential, instead of filing it ahead of the award\u2019s complete resolution. To declare that a lawyer may file a claim for fees in the same action only before the judgment is reviewed by a higher tribunal would deprive him of his aforestated options and render ineffective the foregoing pronouncements of this Court.[15]Here, apparently petitioner filed his claim as an incident of the main action, as in fact, his motion was for the court's approval of charging attorney's lien and the prayer thereto was to direct the entry into the case records the attorney's fees he is claiming. Needless to say, petitioner's motion for approval of charging attorney's lien and order of payment was not intended to be filed as a separate action. Nevertheless, it is within petitioner's right to wait for the finality of the judgment, instead of filing it ahead of the court's resolution, since precisely the basis of the determination of the attorney's fees is the final disposition of the case, that is, the just compensation to be awarded to the private respondents.Moreover, the RTC/SAC decision became final and executory on March 3, 2009, and petitioner filed his Motion to Determine Attorney\u2019s Fees on August 10, 2009, or only about four (4) months from the finality of the RTC/SAC decision. Considering that petitioner and Atty. Domingo\u2019s agreement was contracted verbally, Article 1145[16] of the Civil Code allows petitioner a period of six (6) years within which to file an action to recover professional fees for services rendered.[17] Thus, the disputed motion to approve the charging of attorney's lien and the order of payment was seasonably filed.Petitioner claims that he and Atty. Domingo agreed to a contract for contingent fees equivalent to thirty percent (30%) of the increase of the just compensation awarded, albeit verbally. However, a contract for contingent fees is an agreement in writing by which the fees, usually a fixed percentage of what may be recovered in the action, are made to depend upon the success in the effort to enforce or defend a supposed right. Contingent fees depend upon an express contract, without which the attorney can only recover on the basis of quantum meruit.[18] Here, considering that the contract was made verbally and that there was no evidence presented to justify the 30% contingent fees being claimed by petitioner, the only way to determine his right to appropriate attorney\u2019s fees is to apply the principle of quantum meruit, to wit:Quantum meruit \u2013 literally meaning as much as he deserves \u2013 is used as basis for determining an attorney\u2019s professional fees in the absence of an express agreement. The recovery of attorney\u2019s fees on the basis of quantum meruit is a device that prevents an unscrupulous client from running away with the fruits of the legal services of counsel without paying for it and also avoids unjust enrichment on the part of the attorney himself. An attorney must show that he is entitled to reasonable compensation for the effort in pursuing the client\u2019s cause, taking into account certain factors in fixing the amount of legal fees.Further, Rule 20.01 of the Code of Professional Responsibility lists the guidelines for determining the proper amount of attorney fees, to wit:Rule 20.1 \u2013 A lawyer shall be guided by the following factors in determining his fees:a) The time spent and the extent of the services rendered or required;b) The novelty and difficult of the questions involved;c) The important of the subject matter;d) The skill demanded;e) The probability of losing other employment as a result of acceptance of the proffered case;f) The customary charges for similar services and the schedule of fees of the IBP chapter to which he belongs;g) The amount involved in the controversy and the benefits resulting to the client from the service;h) The contingency or certainty of compensation;i) The character of the employment, whether occasional or established; andj) The professional standing of the lawyer.Private respondents never rebutted the fact that petitioner rendered legal services in the subject case. It is likewise undisputed that it was petitioner who successfully represented Atty. Domingo in Agrarian Case No. 12-17-G before the Special Agrarian Court, in the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 85394, and before this Court in G.R. No. 180108 where the case eventually attained finality. It is, therefore, through petitioner's effort for a lengthy period of seven (7) years that the just compensation for the property owned by deceased Atty. Domingo increased. It cannot be denied then that private respondents benefited from the said increase in the just compensation. Thus, considering petitioner's effort and the amount of time spent in ensuring the successful disposition of the case, petitioner rightfully deserves to be awarded reasonable attorney\u2019s fees for services rendered.Ordinarily, We would have left it to the trial court the determination of attorney's fees based on quantum meruit, however, following the several pronouncements of the Court that it will be just and equitable to now assess and fix the attorney\u2019s fees in order that the resolution thereof would not be needlessly prolonged,[19] this Court, which holds and exercises the power to fix attorney\u2019s fees on quantum meruit basis in the absence of an express written agreement between the attorney and the client, deems it fair to fix petitioner's attorney\u2019s fees at fifteen percent (15%) of the increase in the just compensation awarded to private respondents.The fact that the practice of law is not a business and the attorney plays a vital role in the administration of justice underscores the need to secure him his honorarium lawfully earned as a means to preserve the decorum and respectability of the legal profession. A lawyer is as much entitled to judicial protection against injustice, imposition or fraud on the part of his client as the client against abuse on the part of his counsel. The duty of the court is not alone to see that a lawyer acts in a proper and lawful manner; it is also its duty to see that a lawyer is paid his just fees. With his capital consisting of his brains and with his skill acquired at tremendous cost not only in money but in expenditure of time and energy, he is entitled to the protection of any judicial tribunal against any attempt on the part of his client to escape payment of his just compensation. It would be ironic if after putting forth the best in him to secure justice for his client he himself would not get his due.[20]WHEREFORE, the petition is GRANTED. Accordingly, the Court grants the Motion for Approval of Charging Attorney's Lien filed by petitioner Atty. Augusto M. Aquino. Based on quantum meruit, the amount of attorney's fees is at the rate of fifteen percent (15%) of the amount of the increase in valuation of just compensation awarded to the private respondents.SO ORDERED.Velasco, Jr., (Chairperson), Villarama, Jr., Reyes, and Jardeleza, JJ., concur.February 18, 2015N O T I C E OF J U D G M E N TSirs/Mesdames:Please take notice that on ___January 26, 2015___ a Decision, copy attached herewith, was rendered by the Supreme Court in the above-entitled case, the original of which was received by this Office on February 18, 2015 at 3:15 p.m.Very truly yours,(SGD)WILFREDO V.

CASABAR, AS PRESIDING JUDGE REGIONAL TRIAL COURT-GUIMBA, NUEVA ECIJA, BRANCH 33 AND MA. ALA F. DOMINGO AND MARGARITA IRENE F. DOMINGO, SUBSTITUTING HEIRS OF THE DECEASED ANGEL T. DOMINGO, RESPONDENTS.\n\nD E C I S I O N\n\nPERALTA, J.:\n\nBefore us is a special civil action for certiorari [1] under Rule 65 of the Rules of Court, dated March 17, 2010, filed by Atty. Augusto M. Aquino ( petitioner ) assailing the Order dated January 11, 2010 issued by respondent Presiding Judge Ismael P. Casabar ( public respondent ), in relation to Agrarian Case No. 1217-G, [2] for allegedly having been issued with grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction.\n\nThe facts of the case, as culled from the records, are as follows:\n\nOn June 27, 2002, Atty. Angel T. Domingo (now deceased) verbally contracted petitioner to represent him in Agrarian Case No. 1217-G on a contingency fee basis. The case was for the determination of the just compensation for the expropriation and taking of Atty. Domingo's ricelands consisting of 60.5348 hectares, situated in Guimba, Nueva Ecija, by the Department of Agrarian Reform ( DAR ), pursuant to Presidential Decree (P.D.) 27. The DAR and the Land Bank of the Philippines ( Land Bank ) initially valued Atty. Domingo's property at P484,236.27 or P7,999.30 per hectare, which the latter, through petitioner-counsel, opposed in courts.\n\nEventually, the RTC, acting as Special Agrarian Court ( RTC/SAC ) issued a Decision dated April 12, 2004 fixing the just compensation for Atty. Domingo's property at P2,459,319.70 or P40,626.54 per hectare, or an increase of P1,975,083.43 over the initial DAR and the Land Bank valuation. Land Bank moved for reconsideration, but was denied, thus, it filed a petition for review docketed as\u00a0 CA-G.R. SP No. 85394.\u00a0 However, in a Decision dated June 12, 2007, the appellate court affirmed in toto the SAC Decision dated April 12, 2004.\u00a0 Land Bank moved for reconsideration anew, but was denied.\n\nMeanwhile, on September 30, 2007, Atty. Domingo died.\u00a0 Petitioner filed a Manifestation dated December 11, 2007 of the fact of Atty. Domingo's death and the substitution of the latter by his legal heirs, Ma. Ala F. Domingo and Margarita Irene F. Domingo ( private respondents ).\n\nLand Bank assailed the appellate court's decision and resolution before the Supreme Court via a petition for review on certiorari dated December 4, 2007 docketed as G.R. No. 180108 entitled \u201c Land Bank of the Philippines vs. Angel T. Domingo \u201d. However, in a Resolution dated September 17, 2008, the Court denied the same for failure to sufficiently show any reversible error in the appellate court's decision.\u00a0 On December 15, 2008, the Court denied with finality Land Bank's motion for reconsideration.\n\nOn February 11, 2009, [3] petitioner wrote private respondent Ma. Ala Domingo and informed her of the finality of the RTC/SAC decision as affirmed by the Court of Appeals and the Supreme Court.\u00a0 He then requested her to inform the Land Bank of the segregation of petitioner's thirty percent (30%) contingent attorney's fees out of the increase of the just compensation for the subject property, or thirty percent (30%) of the total increase amounting to Php1,975,983.43. Petitioner claimed never to have received a reply from private respondent.\n\nOn March 30, 2009, petitioner received a copy of the entry of judgment from this Court certifying that its Resolution dated September 17, 2008 in G.R. No. 180108 has already become final and executory on March 3, 2009.\n\nOn July 28, 2009, petitioner received a Notice of Appearance dated July 16, 2009 filed by Atty. Antonio G. Conde, entering his appearance as counsel of herein private respondents and replacing him as counsel in Agrarian Case No. 1217-G.\n\nOn August 14, 2009, private respondents, through their new counsel, Atty. Conde, filed a Motion for Execution dated August 6, 2009 of the RTC/SAC Decision dated April 12, 2004.\n\nOn August 12, 2009, petitioner filed a Motion for Approval of Charging Attorney's Lien and for the Order of Payment. [4] Petitioner further executed an Affidavit [5] dated August 10, 2009, attesting to the circumstances surrounding the legal services he has rendered for the deceased Atty. Domingo and the successful prosecution of the Agrarian case from the RTC/SAC through the appellate court and the Supreme Court.\n\nOn August 18, 2009, private respondents filed a Motion to Dismiss/Expunge Petitioner's Motion. [6] Public respondent Presiding Judge Casabar denied the same. [7] Private respondents moved for reconsideration.\n\nOn January 11, 2010, public respondent Judge Casabar issued the disputed Order denying petitioner's motion for approval of attorney's lien, the dispositive portion of which reads:\n\nx x x x\n\nExamining the basis of the instant motion for reconsideration, this court agrees with respondents \u2013 movants that this court has no jurisdiction over Atty. Aquino's motion for approval of charging (Attorney's) lien having been filed after the judgment has become final and executory. Accordingly, the motion for reconsideration is granted and the motion for approval of (Attorney's) lien is denied and or expunged from the records of the case.\n\nSO ORDERED.\nOn the same day, January 11, 2010, public respondent issued an Order directing the issuance of a Writ of Execution of the RTC/SAC Decision dated April 12, 2004.\n\nOn January 12, 2010, the Clerk of Court of Branch 33, RTC of Guimba, Nueva Ecija, issued a Writ of Execution of the April 12, 2004.\u00a0 On January 15, 2010, the Sheriff of the RTC of Guimba, Nueva Ecija issued a Notice of Garnishment.\n\nThus, the instant petition for certiorari via Rule 65, raising the following issues:\n\nI\nWHETHER OR NOT A CHARGING (ATTORNEY'S) LIEN CAN EFFECTIVELY BE FILED ONLY BEFORE JUDGMENT IS RENDERED.\n\nII\nWHETHER OR NOT RESPONDENT PRESIDING JUDGE HAS THE JURISDICTION TO TAKE COGNIZANCE OVER PETITIONER'S MOTION FOR APPROVAL OF CHARGING (ATTORNEY'S) LIEN FILED AFTER THE JUDGMENT HAS BECOME FINAL AND EXECUTORY.\n\nIII\nWHETHER OR NOT THE RESPONDENT PRESIDING JUDGE ACTED WITH GRAVE ABUSE OF DISCRETION IN ISSUING THE CHALLENGED ORDER. [8]\n\nPetitioner maintains that he filed the motion for charging attorney's lien and order of payment in the very same case, Agrarian Case No. 1217-G, as an incident thereof, wherein he was the counsel during the proceedings of the latter, and that he is allowed to wait until the finality of the case to file the said motion.\n\nPrivate respondents, on the other hand, counter that the motion was belatedly filed and that it was filed without the payment of docket fees, thus, the court a quo did not acquire jurisdiction over the case.\n\nRULING\n\nIn a nutshell, the issue is whether the trial court committed a reversible error in denying the motion to approve attorney's lien and order of payment on the ground that it lost jurisdiction over the case since judgment in the case has already become final and executory.\n\nWe rule in favor of the petitioner.\n\nIn the case of Rosario, Jr. v. De Guzman, [9] the Court clarified a similar issue and discussed the two concepts of attorney\u2019s fees \u2013 that is, ordinary and extraordinary.\u00a0 In its ordinary sense, it is the reasonable compensation paid to a lawyer by his client for legal services rendered.\u00a0 In its extraordinary concept, it is awarded by the court to the successful litigant to be paid by the losing party as indemnity for damages. [10] Although both concepts are similar in some respects, they differ from each other, as further explained below:\n\nThe attorney\u2019s fees which a court may, in proper cases, award to a winning litigant is, strictly speaking, an item of damages.\u00a0 It differs from that which a client pays his counsel for the latter\u2019s professional services. However, the two concepts have many things in common that a treatment of the subject is necessary. The award that the court may grant to a successful party by way of attorney\u2019s fee is an indemnity for damages sustained by him in prosecuting or defending, through counsel, his cause in court. It may be decreed in favor of the party, not his lawyer, in any of the instances authorized by law. On the other hand, the attorney\u2019s fee which a client pays his counsel refers to the compensation for the latter\u2019s services. The losing party against whom damages by way of attorney\u2019s fees may be assessed is not bound by, nor is his liability dependent upon, the fee arrangement of the prevailing party with his lawyer. The amount stipulated in such fee arrangement may, however, be taken into account by the court in fixing the amount of counsel fees as an element of damages.\n\nThe fee as an item of damages belongs to the party litigant and not to his lawyer.\u00a0 It forms part of his judgment recoveries against the losing party. The client and his lawyer may, however, agree that whatever attorney\u2019s fee as an element of damages the court may award shall pertain to the lawyer as his compensation or as part thereof. In such a case, the court upon proper motion may require the losing party to pay such fee directly to the lawyer of the prevailing party.\n\nThe two concepts of attorney\u2019s fees are similar in other respects. They both require, as a prerequisite to their grant, the intervention of or the rendition of professional services by a lawyer.\u00a0 As a client may not be held liable for counsel fees in favor of his lawyer who never rendered services, so too may a party be not held liable for attorney\u2019s fees as damages in favor of the winning party who enforced his rights without the assistance of counsel.\u00a0 Moreover, both fees are subject to judicial control and modification. And the rules governing the determination of their reasonable amount are applicable in one as in the other. [11]\nSimilarly, in the instant case, the attorney\u2019s fees being claimed by the petitioner\u00a0 is the compensation for professional services rendered, and not an indemnity for damages. Petitioner is claiming payment from private respondents\u00a0 for the successful outcome of the agrarian case which he represented. We see no valid reason why public respondent cannot pass upon a proper petition to determine attorney's fees considering that it is already familiar with the nature and the extent of petitioner's legal services. If we are to follow the rule against multiplicity of suits, then with more reason that petitioner's motion should not be dismissed as the same is in effect incidental to the main case.\n\nWe are, likewise, unconvinced that the court a quo did not acquire jurisdiction over the motion solely due to non-payment of docket fees. Petitioner's failure to pay the docket fees pertinent to his motion should not be considered as having divested the court a quo's jurisdiction.\u00a0 We note that, in this case, there was no showing that petitioner intended to evade the payment of docket fees as in fact he manifested willingness to pay the same should it be necessary. [12]\n\nLikewise, pursuant to the ruling in Sun Insurance Office, Ltd. (SIOL) v. Asuncion , should there be unpaid docket fees, the same should be considered as a lien on the judgment.\u00a0 Thus, even on the assumption that additional docket fees are required as a consequence of petitioner's motion, its non-payment will not result in the court\u2019s loss of jurisdiction over the case. [13]\n\nWith regards to how attorney\u2019s fees for professional services can be recovered, and when an action for attorney\u2019s fees for professional services can be filed, the case of Traders Royal Bank Employees Union-Independent v. NLRC [14] is instructive:\n\nx x x It is well settled that a claim for attorney\u2019s fees may be asserted either in the very action in which the services of a lawyer had been rendered or in a separate action.\n\nWith respect to the first situation, the remedy for recovering attorney\u2019s fees as an incident of the main action may be availed of only when something is due to the client. Attorney\u2019s fees cannot be determined until after the main litigation has been decided and the subject of the recovery is at the disposition of the court . The issue over attorney\u2019s fees only arises when something has been recovered from which the fee is to be paid.\n\nWhile a claim for attorney\u2019s fees may be filed before the judgment is rendered, the determination as to the propriety of the fees or as to the amount thereof will have to be held in abeyance until the main case from which the lawyer\u2019s claim for attorney\u2019s fees may arise has become final. Otherwise, the determination to be made by the courts will be premature. Of course, a petition for attorney\u2019s fees may be filed before the judgment in favor of the client is satisfied or the proceeds thereof delivered to the client.\n\nIt is apparent from the foregoing discussion that a lawyer has two options as to when to file his claim for professional fees. Hence, private respondent was well within his rights when he made his claim and waited for the finality of the judgment for holiday pay differential, instead of filing it ahead of the award\u2019s complete resolution. To declare that a lawyer may file a claim for fees in the same action only before the judgment is reviewed by a higher tribunal would deprive him of his aforestated options and render ineffective the foregoing pronouncements of this Court. [15]\n\nHere, apparently petitioner filed his claim as an incident of the main action, as in fact, his motion was for the court's approval of charging attorney's lien and the prayer thereto was to direct the entry into the case records the attorney's fees he is claiming. Needless to say, petitioner's motion for approval of charging attorney's lien and order of payment was not intended to be filed as a separate action.\u00a0 Nevertheless, it is within petitioner's right to wait for the finality of the judgment, instead of filing it ahead of the court's resolution, since precisely the basis of the determination of the attorney's fees is the final disposition of the case, that is, the just compensation to be awarded to the private respondents.\n\nMoreover, the RTC/SAC decision became final and executory on March 3, 2009, and petitioner filed his Motion to Determine Attorney\u2019s Fees on August 10, 2009, or only about four (4) months from the finality of the RTC/SAC decision. Considering that petitioner and Atty. Domingo\u2019s agreement was contracted verbally, Article 1145 [16] of the Civil Code allows petitioner a period of six (6) years within which to file an action to recover professional fees for services rendered. [17] Thus, the disputed motion to approve the charging of attorney's lien and the order of payment was seasonably filed.\n\nPetitioner claims that he and Atty. Domingo agreed to\u00a0 a contract for contingent fees\u00a0 equivalent to thirty percent (30%) of the increase of the just compensation awarded, albeit verbally.\u00a0 However, a contract for contingent fees is an agreement in writing by which the fees, usually a fixed percentage of what may be recovered in the action, are made to depend upon the success in the effort to enforce or defend a supposed right.\u00a0 Contingent fees depend upon an express contract, without which the attorney can only recover on the basis of quantum meruit . [18] Here, considering that the contract was made verbally and that there was no evidence presented to justify the 30% contingent fees being claimed by petitioner, the only way to determine his right to appropriate attorney\u2019s fees is to apply the principle of quantum meruit, to wit:\n\nQuantum meruit \u2013 literally meaning as much as he deserves \u2013 is used as basis for determining an attorney\u2019s professional fees in the absence of an express agreement. The recovery of attorney\u2019s fees on the basis of quantum meruit is a device that prevents an unscrupulous client from running away with the fruits of the legal services of counsel without paying for it and also avoids unjust enrichment on the part of the attorney himself. An attorney must show that he is entitled to reasonable compensation for the effort in pursuing the client\u2019s cause, taking into account certain factors in fixing the amount of legal fees.\n\nFurther, Rule 20.01 of the Code of Professional Responsibility lists the guidelines for determining the proper amount of attorney fees, to wit:\n\nRule 20.1 \u2013 A lawyer shall be guided by the following factors in determining his fees:\na)\u00a0 The time spent and the extent of the services rendered or required;\nb) The novelty and difficult of the questions involved;\nc) The important of the subject matter;\nd) The skill demanded;\ne) The probability of losing other employment as a result of acceptance of the proffered case;\nf) The customary charges for similar services and the schedule of fees of the IBP chapter to which he belongs;\ng) The amount involved in the controversy and the benefits resulting to the client from the service;\nh) The contingency or certainty of compensation;\ni) The character of the employment, whether occasional or\u00a0 established; and\nj)\u00a0 The professional standing of the lawyer.\nPrivate respondents never rebutted the fact that petitioner rendered legal services in the subject case.\u00a0 It is likewise undisputed that it was petitioner who successfully represented Atty. Domingo in Agrarian Case No. 12-17-G before the Special Agrarian Court,\u00a0 in the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 85394, and before this Court in G.R. No. 180108 where the case eventually attained finality.\u00a0 It is, therefore, through petitioner's effort for a lengthy period of\u00a0 seven (7) years that the just compensation for the property owned by deceased Atty. Domingo increased.\u00a0 It cannot be denied then that private respondents benefited from the said increase in the just compensation.\u00a0 Thus, considering petitioner's effort and the amount of time spent in ensuring the successful disposition of the case, petitioner rightfully deserves to be awarded reasonable attorney\u2019s fees for services rendered.\n\nOrdinarily, We would have left it to the trial court the determination of attorney's fees based on quantum meruit , however, following the several pronouncements of the Court that it will be just and equitable to now assess and fix the attorney\u2019s fees in order that the resolution thereof would not be needlessly prolonged, [19] this Court, which holds and exercises the power to fix attorney\u2019s fees on quantum meruit basis in the absence of an express written agreement between the attorney and the client, deems it fair\u00a0 to fix\u00a0 petitioner's attorney\u2019s fees at fifteen percent (15%) of the increase in the just compensation awarded to private respondents.\n\nThe fact that the practice of law is not a business and the attorney plays a vital role in the administration of justice underscores the need to secure him his honorarium lawfully earned as a means to preserve the decorum and respectability of the legal profession.\u00a0 A lawyer is as much entitled to judicial protection against injustice, imposition or fraud on the part of his client as the client against abuse on the part of his counsel.\u00a0 The duty of the court is not alone to see that a lawyer acts in a proper and lawful manner; it is also its duty to see that a lawyer is paid his just fees.\u00a0 With his capital consisting of his brains and with his skill acquired at tremendous cost not only in money but in expenditure of time and energy, he is entitled to the protection of any judicial tribunal against any attempt on the part of his client to escape payment of his just compensation.\u00a0 It would be ironic if after putting forth the best in him to secure justice for his client he himself would not get his due. [20]\n\nWHEREFORE , the petition is GRANTED .\u00a0 Accordingly, the Court grants the Motion for Approval of Charging Attorney's Lien filed by petitioner Atty. Augusto M. Aquino.\u00a0 Based on quantum meruit, the amount of attorney's fees is at the rate of fifteen percent (15%) of the amount of the increase in valuation of just compensation awarded to the private respondents.\n\nSO ORDERED.\n\nVelasco, Jr., (Chairperson), Villarama, Jr., Reyes, and Jardeleza, JJ., concur.\n\nFebruary 18, 2015\n\nN O T I C E OF J U D G M E N T\n\nSirs/Mesdames:\n\nPlease take notice that on ___ January 26, 2015 ___ a Decision, copy attached herewith, was rendered by the Supreme Court in the above-entitled case, the original of which was received by this Office on February 18, 2015 at 3:15 p.m.\n\nVery truly yours,\n(SGD)\nWILFREDO V.

      "title": "PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, PLAINTIFF-APPELLEE, VS. RAKIM MINANGA Y DUMANSAL, ACCUSED-APPELLANT.D E C I S I O N VILLARAMA, JR., J.: Before this Court is an appeal from the June 30, 2011 Decision[1] of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. CR HC No. 00556-MIN which affirmed the July 10, 2007 Decision[2] of the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Butuan City, Branch 4, finding accused-appellant Rakim Minanga y Dumansal[3] (appellant) guilty beyond reasonable doubt of illegal possession of dangerous drugs. Also on appeal is the CA Resolution[4] dated November 21, 2011 denying appellant\u2019s motion for reconsideration.The case stemmed from the Information[5] dated August 13, 2002 charging appellant with violation of Section 11, Article II of Republic Act (R.A.) No. 9165, otherwise known as the Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002, for illegal possession of 12.882 grams of methamphetamine hydrochloride or shabu. The case was docketed as Criminal Case No. 9549.Upon arraignment, appellant pleaded not guilty to the charge.[6]At the trial, Police Officer 1 Rommel dela Cruz Condez (PO1 Condez) and PO2 Saldino Virtudazo (PO2 Virtudazo), Philippine National Police (PNP) officers assigned with the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency (PDEA), and Police Senior Inspector Norman G. Jovita (P/Sr. Insp. Jovita), a Forensic Chemist, testified for the prosecution and established the following facts:After receiving reliable information from a police asset that appellant is actively engaged in selling illegal drugs, a team composed of PO1 Condez, PO2 Virtudazo and the police asset was formed to conduct a buy-bust operation at Purok 3, Barangay 23, Holy Redeemer, Butuan City, against the appellant. PO1 Condez was designated to act as the poseur-buyer with PO2 Virtudazo as his back-up. The team brought with them the amount of P20,000.00 as show money.[7]Upon arrival at the designated place at around 2:30 p.m. of August 12, 2002, the police asset introduced PO1 Condez to the appellant as an interested buyer of shabu. After the appellant agreed to sell to PO1 Condez four \u201csacks\u201d of shabu for the amount of P20,000.00, appellant told PO1 Condez to wait. Appellant then left and after a few minutes returned. He then showed PO1 Condez four big sachets of shabu. After receiving the four sachets, PO1 Condez examined them and being convinced of their genuineness, gave the prearranged signal. Thus, PO2 Virtudazo rushed to the scene. The police officers introduced themselves as PDEA agents and arrested the appellant, informing the latter of his constitutional rights. The money was not given to appellant as it was intended only as show money. PO1 Condez marked the four sachets given by the appellant as RCC 1 to RCC 4. The appellant was then brought to the police station for investigation.[8]At the police station, appellant was photographed in the presence of a Barangay Captain and a State Prosecutor.[9] Armed with the corresponding requests,[10] the four marked sachets and the appellant were brought by PO1 Condez and PO2 Virtudazo to the PNP Crime Laboratory for examination.[11] At the PNP Crime Laboratory, the four sachets were marked as A-1, A-2, A-3 and A-4 by P/Sr. Insp. Jovita, the Forensic Chemist.[12] While the drug test conducted on the person of the appellant yielded a negative result,[13] the four sachets with a total weight of 12.882 grams were positive for methamphetamine hydrochloride.[14]On cross-examination, PO1 Condez testified that initially the PDEA filed a case against the appellant for violation of Section 5, Article II of R.A. No. 9165 or for illegal sale of shabu but when the investigation reached the Office of the City Prosecutor the case was modified to one for illegal possession.[15]On the other hand, the defense gave a different version of the story.The defense presented as its witnesses Nellie Salino Nalasa (Nellie), Benhur Burdeos (Benhur), and the appellant himself.Nellie testified that she is the owner of a two-storey house where one Max Malubay (Max) was renting one of the rooms on the ground floor. She said that on August 12, 2002, at around 11:30 a.m., she noticed a commotion emanating from the adjacent room rented by Max. She saw three armed persons in white shirts kicking appellant, a visitor of Max. After witnessing the incident, she hid herself.[16]Benhur testified that on August 12, 2002, at around 12:00 noon, he saw four to five persons walking on single file towards Nellie\u2019s house. He added that he heard a commotion thereafter and saw a person named Rakim with handcuffed hands taken by the armed men from Nellie\u2019s house. He said that there was no buy-bust operation conducted at that time.[17]As the last witness for the defense, appellant denied the charge against him. He testified that on August 12, 2002, at around 12:00 noon, five armed men forcibly entered the room rented by Max and arrested him. He identified one of the five men as a Muslim who has a grudge against him. He claimed that the Muslim influenced the police officers to arrest him. He added that in his presence the Muslim gave SPO3 Dindo Alota money as payment for his arrest. He also claimed that he was mauled and brought to the police station for investigation; that he was informed that he was arrested for selling illegal drugs; and that at the police station he was photographed.[18]On July 10, 2007, the RTC rendered its Decision[19] in Criminal Case No. 9549 and found appellant guilty as charged of violation of Section 11, paragraph 2, sub-paragraph (1),[20] Article II of R.A. No. 9165. The RTC held that the prosecution was able to prove all the elements of illegal possession of drugs in this case. The RTC said that appellant\u2019s assertion that money was handed by the Muslim to the police officers in his presence is illogical, uncommon and unconvincing. The RTC also found that the two other defense witnesses lacked candor and their combined testimonies have earmarks of falsehood.[21] Thus, the RTC disposed of the case in this wise:WHEREFORE, premises considered, accused Rakim Minanga y Dumansal is found guilty beyond reasonable doubt [of] violation of Section 11, paragraph 2, Sub-par. (1) of Art II of Republic Act 9165, otherwise known as the Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002, and is hereby sentenced to suffer the extreme penalty of Life imprisonment and to pay a fine of Four Hundred Thousand (P400,000.00) Pesos without subsidiary imprisonment in case of insolvency.The four (4) sachets of shabu [are] hereby declared confiscated in favor of the government to be dealt with in accordance with law.Accused shall serve his sentence at the Davao Prison and Penal Farm at Sto. Tomas, Davao del Norte and shall be credited in the service of his sentence with his preventive imprisonment conformably with Art. 29 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended.However, accused shall remain at the City Jail until the termination of Crim. Case No. 10161.SO ORDERED.[22]In its June 30, 2011 Decision, the CA affirmed the RTC\u2019s Decision. In its November 21, 2011 Resolution,[23] the CA denied appellant\u2019s motion for reconsideration. Hence, this appeal.In his supplemental brief,[24] appellant claims that the CA erred:In failing to appreciate that the buy-bust operation on 12 August [2002] as admitted to by police officers in their testimonies, constituted the factual backdrop for the arrest and indictment of Accused-Appellant for illegal possession of prohibited drugs;In failing to appreciate serious irregularities attendant to the entrapment operation and procedure employed by the police officers;In affirming the lower court\u2019s appreciation and application of presumption of regularity in the performance of official duty by the police officers;In failing to appreciate that the failure of the prosecution to cross-examine Accused-Appellant on material and relevant points, did not destroy his oral testimony or direct examination;In holding that \u201cappellant\u2019s entry of a valid plea and active participation in the trial cured any defect in his arrest;\u201dIn affirming the lower court\u2019s finding that the prosecution proved all the elements of the offense; [and]Assuming arguendo that indeed Accused-Appellant possessed the prohibited drugs, for failing to consider that police officers may have engaged in or employed INDUCEMENT rather than ENTRAPMENT.[25]The sole issue to be resolved is whether or not the appellant\u2019s guilt was proven beyond reasonable doubt.We rule in the affirmative.The essential elements of illegal possession of dangerous drugs are (1) the accused is in possession of an item or object that is identified to be a prohibited drug; (2) such possession is not authorized by law; and (3) the accused freely and consciously possess the said drug.[26]We find that these essential elements were proven in this case. Appellant was caught in flagrante possessing 12.882 grams of shabu, a dangerous drug, packed in four big sachets. His possession of said dangerous drugs is not authorized by law. And he was freely and consciously possessing the contraband as shown by his act of handing these four sachets to PO1 Condez in an intended sale. We note that appellant was positively identified by PO1 Condez as the one who handed over the four sachets. However, the money was not given to appellant as it was intended only as show money.The Court gives full faith and credence to the testimonies of the police officers and upholds the presumption of regularity in the apprehending officers\u2019 performance of official duty. It is a settled rule that in cases involving violations of the Dangerous Drugs Act, credence is given to prosecution witnesses who are police officers, for they are presumed to have performed their duties in a regular manner, unless there is evidence to the contrary.[27]On the other hand, appellant failed to present clear and convincing evidence to overturn the presumption that the arresting officers regularly performed their duties. Except for his bare allegations of denial and frame-up that a certain Muslim was behind his arrest, nothing supports his claim that the police officers were impelled by improper motives to testify against him. In fact, in his direct testimony, appellant was asked whether he knew said Muslim but despite the opportunity given to him, he failed to identify him in court.[28]This Court has invariably viewed with disfavor the defenses of denial and frame-up. Such defenses can easily be fabricated and are common ploy in prosecutions for the illegal sale and possession of dangerous drugs. In order to prosper, such defenses must be proved with strong and convincing evidence.[29]Moreover, in weighing the testimonies of the prosecution witnesses vis-\u00e0-vis those of the defense, the RTC gave more credence to the version of the prosecution, to which this Court finds no reason to disagree. Well-settled is the rule that in the absence of palpable error or grave abuse of discretion on the part of the trial judge, the trial court\u2019s evaluation of the credibility of witnesses will not be disturbed on appeal.[30] Prosecutions involving illegal drugs depend largely on the credibility of the police officers who conduct the \u201cbuy-bust\u201d operation and appellate courts, upon established precedents and of necessity, rely on the assessment of the credibility of witnesses by the trial courts which have the unique opportunity, unavailable to the appellate courts, to observe the witnesses and to note their demeanor, conduct, and attitude under direct and cross-examination.[31]Lastly, appellant claims that there was no inventory of the prohibited items allegedly seized from him. He argues that as a result of this omission, there is doubt as to the identity and integrity of the drugs and that there was a break in the chain of custody of the evidence.[32]Such argument cannot prosper.The Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR) of R.A. No. 9165 provides:SECTION 21. Custody and Disposition of Confiscated, Seized and/or Surrendered Dangerous Drugs, Plant Sources of Dangerous Drugs, Controlled Precursors and Essential Chemicals, Instruments/Paraphernalia and/or Laboratory Equipment. \u2013 The PDEA shall take charge and have custody of all dangerous drugs, plant sources of dangerous drugs, controlled precursors and essential chemicals, as well as instruments/paraphernalia and/or laboratory equipment so confiscated, seized and/or surrendered, for proper disposition in the following manner:(a) The apprehending officer/team having initial custody and control of the drugs shall, immediately after seizure and confiscation, physically inventory and photograph the same in the presence of the accused or the person/s from whom such items were confiscated and/or seized, or his/her representative or counsel, a representative from the media and the Department of Justice (DOJ), and any elected public official who shall be required to sign the copies of the inventory and be given a copy thereof; Provided, that the physical inventory and photograph shall be conducted at the place where the search warrant is served; or at the nearest police station or at the nearest office of the apprehending officer/team, whichever is practicable, in case of warrantless seizures; Provided, further, that non-compliance with these requirements under justifiable grounds, as long as the integrity and the evidentiary value of the seized items are properly preserved by the apprehending officer/team, shall not render void and invalid such seizures of and custody over said items[.] (Emphasis supplied)Evidently, the law itself lays down exceptions to its requirements. Thus, non-compliance with the above-mentioned requirements is not fatal. In fact it has been ruled time and again that non-compliance with Section 21 of the IRR does not make the items seized inadmissible. What is imperative is \u201cthe preservation of the integrity and the evidential value of the seized items as the same would be utilized in the determination of the guilt or innocence of the accused.\u201d[33]In this case, the chain of custody can be easily established through the following link: (1) PO1 Condez marked the seized four sachets handed to him by appellant with RCC 1 to RCC 4; (2) a request for laboratory examination of the seized items marked RCC 1 to RCC 4 was signed by Police Superintendent Glenn Dichosa Dela Torre;[34] (3) the request and the marked items seized, which were personally delivered by PO1 Condez and PO2 Virtudazo, were received by the PNP Crime Laboratory; (4) Chemistry Report No. D-106-2002[35] confirmed that the marked items seized from appellant were methamphetamine hydrochloride; and (5) the marked items were offered in evidence.Hence, it is clear that the integrity and the evidentiary value of the seized drugs were preserved. This Court, therefore, finds no reason to overturn the findings of the RTC that the drugs seized from appellant were the same ones presented during trial. Accordingly, it is but logical to conclude that the chain of custody of the illicit drugs seized from appellant remains unbroken, contrary to the assertions of appellant.In sum, we find no reversible error committed by the RTC and CA in convicting appellant of illegal possession of drugs as to warrant the modification much less the reversal thereof. It is hornbook doctrine that the factual findings of the CA affirming those of the trial court are binding on this Court unless there is a clear showing that such findings are tainted with arbitrariness, capriciousness or palpable error.[36] This case is no exception to the rule. All told, this Court thus sustains the conviction of the appellant for violation of Section 11, Article II of R.A. No. 9165.WHEREFORE, the appeal is DISMISSED. The June 30, 2011 Decision and November 21, 2011 Resolution of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CR HC No. 00556-MIN are AFFIRMED.With costs against the accused-appellant.SO ORDERED.Velasco, Jr., (Chairperson), Peralta, Bersamin,* and Reyes, JJ., concur.February 17, 2015N O T I C E OF J U D G M E N TSirs/Mesdames:Please take notice that on ___January 21, 2015___ a Decision, copy attached herewith, was rendered by the Supreme Court in the above-entitled case, the original of which was received by this Office on February 17, 2015 at 10:55 a.m.Very truly yours,(SGD)WILFREDO V.

[7]\n\nUpon arrival at the designated place at around 2:30 p.m. of August 12, 2002, the police asset introduced PO1 Condez to the appellant as an interested buyer of shabu .\u00a0 After the appellant agreed to sell to PO1 Condez four \u201csacks\u201d of shabu for the amount of P20,000.00, appellant told PO1 Condez to wait.\u00a0 Appellant then left and after a few minutes returned.\u00a0 He then showed PO1 Condez four big sachets of shabu .\u00a0 After receiving the four sachets, PO1 Condez examined them and being convinced of their genuineness, gave the prearranged signal.\u00a0 Thus, PO2 Virtudazo rushed to the scene.\u00a0 The police officers introduced themselves as PDEA agents and arrested the appellant, informing the latter of his constitutional rights.\u00a0 The money was not given to appellant as it was intended only as show money.\u00a0 PO1 Condez marked the four sachets given by the appellant as RCC 1 to RCC 4. The appellant was then brought to the police station for investigation. [8]\n\nAt the police station, appellant was photographed in the presence of a Barangay Captain and a State Prosecutor. [9] Armed with the corresponding requests, [10] the four marked sachets and the appellant were brought by PO1 Condez and PO2 Virtudazo to the PNP Crime Laboratory for examination. [11] At the PNP Crime Laboratory, the four sachets were marked as A-1, A-2, A-3 and A-4 by P/Sr. Insp. Jovita, the Forensic Chemist. [12] While the drug test conducted on the person of the appellant yielded a negative result, [13] the four sachets with a total weight of 12.882 grams were positive for methamphetamine hydrochloride. [14]\n\nOn cross-examination, PO1 Condez testified that initially the PDEA filed a case against the appellant for violation of Section 5, Article II of R.A. No. 9165 or for illegal sale of shabu but when the investigation reached the Office of the City Prosecutor the case was modified to one for illegal possession. [15]\n\nOn the other hand, the defense gave a different version of the story.\n\nThe defense presented as its witnesses Nellie Salino Nalasa (Nellie), Benhur Burdeos (Benhur), and the appellant himself.\n\nNellie testified that she is the owner of a two-storey house where one Max Malubay (Max) was renting one of the rooms on the ground floor.\u00a0 She said that on August 12, 2002, at around 11:30 a.m., she noticed a commotion emanating from the adjacent room rented by Max.\u00a0 She saw three armed persons in white shirts kicking appellant, a visitor of Max.\u00a0 After witnessing the incident, she hid herself. [16]\n\nBenhur testified that on August 12, 2002, at around 12:00 noon, he saw four to five persons walking on single file towards Nellie\u2019s house.\u00a0 He added that he heard a commotion thereafter and saw a person named Rakim with handcuffed hands taken by the armed men from Nellie\u2019s house.\u00a0 He said that there was no buy-bust operation conducted at that time. [17]\n\nAs the last witness for the defense, appellant denied the charge against him.\u00a0 He testified that on August 12, 2002, at around 12:00 noon, five armed men forcibly entered the room rented by Max and arrested him.\u00a0 He identified one of the five men as a Muslim who has a grudge against him.\u00a0 He claimed that the Muslim influenced the police officers to arrest him.\u00a0 He added that in his presence the Muslim gave SPO3 Dindo Alota money as payment for his arrest.\u00a0 He also claimed that he was mauled and brought to the police station for investigation; that he was informed that he was arrested for selling illegal drugs; and that at the police station he was photographed. [18]\n\nOn July 10, 2007, the RTC rendered its Decision [19] in Criminal Case No. 9549 and found appellant guilty as charged of violation of Section 11, paragraph 2, sub-paragraph (1), [20] Article II of R.A. No. 9165.\u00a0 The RTC held that the prosecution was able to prove all the elements of illegal possession of drugs in this case.\u00a0 The RTC said that appellant\u2019s assertion that money was handed by the Muslim to the police officers in his presence is illogical, uncommon and unconvincing.\u00a0 The RTC also found that the two other defense witnesses lacked candor and their combined testimonies have earmarks of falsehood. [21] Thus, the RTC disposed of the case in this wise:\n\nWHEREFORE, premises considered, accused Rakim Minanga y Dumansal is found guilty beyond reasonable doubt [of] violation of Section 11, paragraph 2, Sub-par. (1) of Art II of Republic Act 9165, otherwise known as the Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002, and is hereby sentenced to suffer the extreme penalty of Life imprisonment and to pay a fine of Four Hundred Thousand (P400,000.00) Pesos without subsidiary imprisonment in case of insolvency.\n\nThe four (4) sachets of shabu [are] hereby declared confiscated in favor of the government to be dealt with in accordance with law.\n\nAccused shall serve his sentence at the Davao Prison and Penal Farm at Sto. Tomas, Davao del Norte and shall be credited in the service of his sentence with his preventive imprisonment conformably with Art. 29 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended.\n\nHowever, accused shall remain at the City Jail until the termination of Crim. Case No. 10161.\n\nSO ORDERED. [22]\n\nIn its June 30, 2011 Decision, the CA affirmed the RTC\u2019s Decision.\u00a0 In its November 21, 2011 Resolution, [23] the CA denied appellant\u2019s motion for reconsideration.\u00a0 Hence, this appeal.\n\nIn his supplemental brief, [24] appellant claims that the CA erred:\n\nIn failing to appreciate that the buy-bust operation on 12 August [2002] as admitted to by police officers in their testimonies, constituted the factual backdrop for the arrest and indictment of Accused-Appellant for illegal possession of prohibited drugs;\n\nIn failing to appreciate\u00a0 serious irregularities attendant to the entrapment operation and procedure employed by the police officers;\n\nIn affirming the lower court\u2019s appreciation and application of presumption of regularity in the performance of official duty by the police officers;\n\nIn failing to appreciate that the failure of the prosecution to cross-examine Accused-Appellant on material and relevant points, did not destroy his oral testimony or direct examination;\n\nIn holding that \u201cappellant\u2019s entry of a valid plea and active participation in the trial cured any defect in his arrest;\u201d\n\nIn affirming the lower court\u2019s finding that the prosecution proved all the elements of the offense; [and]\n\nAssuming arguendo that indeed Accused-Appellant possessed the prohibited drugs, for failing to consider that police officers may have engaged in or employed INDUCEMENT rather than ENTRAPMENT. [25]\nThe sole issue to be resolved is whether or not the appellant\u2019s guilt was proven beyond reasonable doubt.\n\nWe rule in the affirmative.\n\nThe essential elements of illegal possession of dangerous drugs are (1) the accused is in possession of an item or object that is identified to be a prohibited drug; (2) such possession is not authorized by law; and (3) the accused freely and consciously possess the said drug. [26]\n\nWe find that these essential elements were proven in this case.\u00a0 Appellant was caught in flagrante possessing 12.882 grams of shabu , a dangerous drug, packed in four big sachets.\u00a0 His possession of said dangerous drugs is not authorized by law.\u00a0 And he was freely and consciously possessing the contraband as shown by his act of handing these four sachets to PO1 Condez in an intended sale.\u00a0 We note that appellant was positively identified by PO1 Condez as the one who handed over the four sachets.\u00a0 However, the money was not given to appellant as it was intended only as show money.\n\nThe Court gives full faith and credence to the testimonies of the police officers and upholds the presumption of regularity in the apprehending officers\u2019 performance of official duty.\u00a0 It is a settled rule that in cases involving violations of the Dangerous Drugs Act, credence is given to prosecution witnesses who are police officers, for they are presumed to have performed their duties in a regular manner, unless there is evidence to the contrary. [27]\n\nOn the other hand, appellant failed to present clear and convincing evidence to overturn the presumption that the arresting officers regularly performed their duties.\u00a0 Except for his bare allegations of denial and frame-up that a certain Muslim was behind his arrest, nothing supports his claim that the police officers were impelled by improper motives to testify against him.\u00a0 In fact, in his direct testimony, appellant was asked whether he knew said Muslim but despite the opportunity given to him, he failed to identify him in court. [28]\n\nThis Court has invariably viewed with disfavor the defenses of denial and frame-up.\u00a0 Such defenses can easily be fabricated and are common ploy in prosecutions for the illegal sale and possession of dangerous drugs.\u00a0 In order to prosper, such defenses must be proved with strong and convincing evidence. [29]\n\nMoreover, in weighing the testimonies of the prosecution witnesses vis-\u00e0-vis those of the defense, the RTC gave more credence to the version of the prosecution, to which this Court finds no reason to disagree.\u00a0 Well-settled is the rule that in the absence of palpable error or grave abuse of discretion on the part of the trial judge, the trial court\u2019s evaluation of the credibility of witnesses will not be disturbed on appeal. [30] Prosecutions involving illegal drugs depend largely on the credibility of the police officers who conduct the \u201cbuy-bust\u201d operation and appellate courts, upon established precedents and of necessity, rely on the assessment of the credibility of witnesses by the trial courts which have the unique opportunity, unavailable to the appellate courts, to observe the witnesses and to note their demeanor, conduct, and attitude under direct and cross-examination. [31]\n\nLastly, appellant claims that there was no inventory of the prohibited items allegedly seized from him. He argues that as a result of this omission, there is doubt as to the identity and integrity of the drugs and that there was a break in the chain of custody of the evidence. [32]\n\nSuch argument cannot prosper.\n\nThe Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR) of R.A. No. 9165 provides:\n\nSECTION 21. Custody and Disposition of Confiscated, Seized and/or Surrendered Dangerous Drugs, Plant Sources of Dangerous Drugs, Controlled Precursors and Essential Chemicals, Instruments/Paraphernalia and/or Laboratory Equipment. \u2013 The PDEA shall take charge and have custody of all dangerous drugs, plant sources of dangerous drugs, controlled precursors and essential chemicals, as well as instruments/paraphernalia and/or laboratory equipment so confiscated, seized and/or surrendered, for proper disposition in the following manner:\n\n(a) The apprehending officer/team having initial custody and control of the drugs shall, immediately after seizure and confiscation, physically inventory and photograph the same in the presence of the accused or the person/s from whom such items were confiscated and/or seized, or his/her representative or counsel, a representative from the media and the Department of Justice (DOJ), and any elected public official who shall be required to sign the copies of the inventory and be given a copy thereof; Provided, that the physical inventory and photograph shall be conducted at the place where the search warrant is served; or at the nearest police station or at the nearest office of the apprehending officer/team, whichever is practicable, in case of warrantless seizures; Provided, further, that non-compliance with these requirements under justifiable grounds, as long as the integrity and the evidentiary value of the seized items are properly preserved by the apprehending officer/team, shall not render void and invalid such seizures of and custody over said items [.]\u00a0 (Emphasis supplied)\nEvidently, the law itself lays down exceptions to its requirements.\u00a0 Thus, non-compliance with the above-mentioned requirements is not fatal. In fact it has been ruled time and again that non-compliance with Section 21 of the IRR does not make the items seized inadmissible.\u00a0 What is imperative is \u201cthe preservation of the integrity and the evidential value of the seized items as the same would be utilized in the determination of the guilt or innocence of the accused.\u201d [33]\n\nIn this case, the chain of custody can be easily established through the following link: (1) PO1 Condez marked the seized four sachets handed to him by appellant with RCC 1 to RCC 4; (2) a request for laboratory examination of the seized items marked RCC 1 to RCC 4 was signed by Police Superintendent Glenn Dichosa Dela Torre; [34] (3) the request and the marked items seized, which were personally delivered by PO1 Condez and PO2 Virtudazo, were received by the PNP Crime Laboratory; (4) Chemistry Report No. D-106-2002 [35] confirmed that the marked items seized from appellant were methamphetamine hydrochloride; and (5) the marked items were offered in evidence.\n\nHence, it is clear that the integrity and the evidentiary value of the seized drugs were preserved.\u00a0 This Court, therefore, finds no reason to overturn the findings of the RTC that the drugs seized from appellant were the same ones presented during trial.\u00a0 Accordingly, it is but logical to conclude that the chain of custody of the illicit drugs seized from appellant remains unbroken, contrary to the assertions of appellant.\n\nIn sum, we find no reversible error committed by the RTC and CA in convicting appellant of illegal possession of drugs as to warrant the modification much less the reversal thereof.\u00a0 It is hornbook doctrine that the factual findings of the CA affirming those of the trial court are binding on this Court unless there is a clear showing that such findings are tainted with arbitrariness, capriciousness or palpable error. [36] This case is no exception to the rule.\u00a0 All told, this Court thus sustains the conviction of the appellant for violation of Section 11, Article II of R.A. No. 9165.\n\nWHEREFORE , the appeal is DISMISSED .\u00a0 The June 30, 2011 Decision and November 21, 2011 Resolution of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CR HC No. 00556-MIN are AFFIRMED.\n\nWith costs against the accused-appellant.\n\nSO ORDERED .\n\nVelasco, Jr., (Chairperson), Peralta, Bersamin, * and Reyes, JJ. , concur.\n\nFebruary 17, 2015\n\nN O T I C E OF J U D G M E N T\n\nSirs/Mesdames:\n\nPlease take notice that on ___ January 21, 2015 ___ a Decision, copy attached herewith, was rendered by the Supreme Court in the above-entitled case, the original of which was received by this Office on February 17, 2015 at 10:55 a.m.\n\nVery truly yours,\n(SGD)\nWILFREDO V.

JERIC PAVIA Y PALIZA @ \u201cJERIC\u201d AND JUAN BUENDIA Y DELOS REYES @ \u201cJUNE\u201d, ACCUSED-APPELLANTS.R E S O L U T I O N PEREZ, J.: For resolution of the Court is the appeal filed by Jeric Pavia and Juan Buendia (appellants) from the Decision[1] of the Court of Appeals (CA) dated 7 February 2012 in CA-G.R. CR-H.C. No. 04020. The CA affirmed the Judgment[2] of the Regional Trial Court (RTC), Branch 31, San Pedro, Laguna which found appellants guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the offense of illegal possession of dangerous drugs punishable under Section 13, Article II of Republic Act (R.A.) No. 9165. Appellants were sentenced to suffer the penalty of life imprisonment and to pay a fine of P500,000.00.The AntecedentsOn 29 March 2005, at around 6:00 in the evening, a confidential informant reported to SPO3 Melchor dela Pe\u00f1a (SPO3 Dela Pe\u00f1a) of the San Pedro Municipal Police Station, San Pedro, Laguna, that a pot session was taking place at the house of a certain \u201cObet\u201d located at Barangay Cuyab, San Pedro, Laguna. Upon receipt of the information, SPO3 Dela Pe\u00f1a formed a team to conduct police operations against the suspect. The team was composed of the confidential informant, PO2 Rommel Bautista (PO2 Bautista), PO3 Jay Parunggao (PO3 Parunggao), PO1 Jifford Signap and SPO3 Dela Pe\u00f1a as team leader.[3]At around 9:00 in the evening of the same date, the team proceeded to the target area. When the team arrived, the members saw that Obet\u2019s house was closed. Since the house was not surrounded by a fence, PO2 Bautista approached the house and peeped through a small opening in a window where he saw four persons in a circle having a pot session in the living room. PO3 Parunggao then tried to find a way to enter the house and found an unlocked door. He entered the house, followed by PO2 Bautista and they caught the four persons engaged in a pot session by surprise. After they introduced themselves as police officers, they arrested the four suspects and seized the drug paraphernalia found at the scene.[4] Among those arrested were herein appellants, from each of whom a plastic sachet containing white crystalline substance were confiscated by PO3 Parunggao after he conducted a body search on their persons.[5] PO3 Parunggao marked the plastic sachet he seized from appellant Pavia with \u201cJP,\u201d representing the initials of Jeric Pavia while that taken from appellant Buendia was marked, also by PO3 Parunggao, with \u201cJB,\u201d representing the initials of Juan Buendia.[6] These plastic sachets were transmitted to the crime laboratory for qualitative examination where they tested positive for \u201cshabu.\u201d[7]Consequently, appellants were charged with violation of Section 13, Article II of R.A. No. 9165 in two separate but identically worded informations which read:That on or about 29 March 2005, in the Municipality of San Pedro, Province of Laguna, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court accused without authority of the law, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously have in his possession, control and custody [of] METHAMPHETAMINE HYDROCHLORIDE, commonly known as shabu, a dangerous drug, weighing zero point zero two (0.02) gram, in the company of two persons. [8]When arraigned, both appellants pleaded not guilty to the offense.[9]A joint trial of the cases ensued.In defense, appellants provided a different version of the incident. According to them, on the questioned date and time, they were roaming the streets of Baranggay Cuyab, selling star apples. A prospective buyer of the fruits called them over to his house and requested them to go inside, to which they acceded. When they were about to leave the house, several persons who introduced themselves as policemen arrived and invited appellants to go with them to the precinct. There, they were incarcerated and falsely charged with violation of the Comprehensive Drugs Act of 2002.[10]The Ruling of the RTCThe trial court found that the prosecution was able to prove the offense charged through the spontaneous, positive and credible testimony of its witness. The trial court noted that the police officers carried out a lawful arrest before they proceeded with the bodily search of appellants. Moreover, there was no clear and convincing evidence that the team of PO3 Parunggao was inspired by any improper motive when they carried out their operation. Thus, the testimony of PO2 Bautista on the witness stand, narrating the events leading to the apprehension of appellants, deserves full faith and credit.[11]The Ruling of the Court of AppealsOn appeal, the CA affirmed the decision of the RTC, upon a finding that the evidence on record support the trial court\u2019s conclusion that a lawful arrest, search and seizure took place, and that the prosecution fully discharged its burden of establishing, beyond reasonable doubt, all the elements necessary for the conviction of the offense charged.[12]On the contention of appellants that their warrantless arrest was illegal and, therefore, the items seized from them as a result of that arrest were inadmissible in evidence against them, the CA held that this argument totally lacks merit. According to the CA:We stress at the outset that the [appellants] failed to question the legality of their warrantless arrest. The established rule is that an accused [is] estopped from assailing the legality of [his] arrest if [he] failed to move for the quashing of the Information against [him] before [his] arraignment. Any objection involving the arrest or the procedure in the court\u2019s acquisition of jurisdiction over the person of an accused must be made before [he] enter[s] [his] plea; otherwise, the objection is deemed waived.In any event, we carefully examined the records and now hold that the warrantless arrests conducted on [appellants] were valid. Section 5, Rule 113 of the Rules on Criminal Procedure lists the situations when a person may be arrested without a warrant x x x.x x x xParagraph (a) of Section 5 is commonly known as an in flagrante delicto arrest. For a warrantless arrest of an accused caught in flagrante delicto to be valid, two requisites must concur: (1) the person to be arrested must execute an overt act indicating that he has just committed, is actually committing, or is attempting to commit a crime; and (2) such overt act is done in the presence or within the view of the arresting officer.After a careful evaluation of the evidence in its totality, we hold that the prosecution successfully established that the petitioner was arrested in flagrante delicto.We emphasize that the series of events that led the police to the house where the pot session was conducted and to their arrest were triggered by a \u201ctip\u201d from a concerned citizen that a \u201cpot session\u201d was in progress at the house of a certain \u201cObet\u201d at Baranggay Cuyab, San Pedro, Laguna. Under the circumstances, the police did not have enough time to secure a search warrant considering the \u201ctime element\u201d involved in the process (i.e., a pot session may not be an extended period of time and it was then 9:00 p.m.). In view of the urgency, SPO3 Melchor dela Pe\u00f1a immediately dispatched his men to proceed to the identified place to verify the report. At the place, the responding police officers verified through a small opening in the window and saw the accused-appellants and their other two (2) companions sniffing \u201cshabu\u201d to use the words of PO2 Bautista. There was therefore sufficient probable cause for the police officers to believe that the accused-appellants were then and there committing a crime. As it turned out, the accused-appellants indeed possessed and were even using a prohibited drug, contrary to law. When an accused is caught in flagrante delicto, the police officers are not only authorized but are duty-bound to arrest him even without a warrant.In the course of the arrest and in accordance with police procedures, the [appellants] were frisked, which search yielded the prohibited drug in their possession. These circumstances were sufficient to justify the warrantless search x x x that yielded two (2) heat-sealed plastic sachets of \u201cshabu.\u201d x x xx x x xAll the x x x requirements for a lawful search and seizure are present in this case. The police officers had prior justification to be at a certain \u201cObet\u2019s\u201d place as they were dispatched by their desk officer; they arrested the [appellants] as they had reason to believe that they were illegally using and possessing a prohibited drug and drug paraphernalia. The search of the [appellants] incident to their arrest yielded the confiscated crystalline substance which later proved to be \u201cshabu\u201d. In the course of their lawful intrusion, they inadvertently saw the various drug paraphernalia scattered in the living room. As these items were plainly visible, the police officers were justified in seizing them.x x x xAs correctly found by the trial court, the [appellants'] story is unworthy of belief. Their denial must fail in the light of the positive identification and declarations made by the prosecution witness. As stated earlier, PO2 Bautista testified in a straightforward and categorical manner regarding the identities of the malefactors. He did not waver despite the defense counsel's rigid questioning.Courts generally view the defense of denial with disfavor due to the facility with which an accused can concoct it to suit his or her defense. As evidence that is both negative and self-serving, this defense cannot attain more credibility than the testimony of the prosecution witness who testified clearly, providing thereby positive evidence on the various aspects of the crime committed. One such positive evidence is the result of the laboratory examination conducted by the PNP crime Laboratory on the drugs recovered from the [appellants] which revealed that the confiscated plastic sachets tested positive for the presence of \"shabu\u201d: two (2) heated transparent plastic sachet with markings \u201cJB\u201d and \u201cJP\u201d containing 0.02 gram of white crystalline substance each both yielded positive results.[13]With respect to appellants\u2019 claim that the prosecution failed to establish the chain of custody because the police operatives failed to strictly comply with Section 21 (1) of R.A. No. 9165, the CA has this to say:The chain of custody rule requires that the admission of an exhibit be preceded by evidence sufficient to support a finding that the matter in question is what the proponent claims it to be.Contrary to what the [appellants] want to portray, the chain of custody of the seized prohibited drug was shown not to have been broken. After the seizure of the plastic sachets containing white crystalline substance from the [appellants'] possession and of the various drug paraphernalia in the living room, the police immediately brought the [appellants] to the police station, together with the seized items. PO3 Parunggao himself brought these items to the police station and marked them. The plastic sachets containing white crystalline substance was marked \"JB\" and \"JP\". These confiscated items were immediately turned over by PO2 Bautista to the PNP Regional Crime Laboratory Office Calabarzon, Camp Vicente Lim, Calamba City for examination to determine the presence of dangerous drugs. After a qualitative examination conducted on the specimens, Forensic Chemist Lorna Ravelas Tria concluded that the plastic sachets recovered from the accused-appellants tested positive for methylamphetamine hydrochloride, a prohibited drug, per Chemistry Report Nos. D-0381-05 and D-0382-05.When the prosecution presented these marked specimens in court, PO2 Baustista positively identified them to be the same items they seized from the [appellants] and which PO3 Parunggao later marked at the police station, from where the seized items were turned over to the laboratory for examination based on a duly prepared request.Thus, the prosecution established the crucial link in the chain of custody of the seized items from the time they were first discovered until they were brought for examination. Besides, as earlier stated, the [appellants] did not contest the admissibility of the seized items during the tria1. The integrity and the evidentiary value of the drugs seized from the accused-appellants were therefore duly proven not to have been compromised.Jurisprudence teems with pronouncements that failure to strictly comply, with Section 2l (1), Article II of R.A. No. 9165 does not necessarily render an accused's arrest illegal or the items seized or confiscated from him inadmissible. What is of utmost importance is the preservation of the integrity and the evidentiary value of the seized items, as these would be utilized in the determination of the guilt or innocence of the accused. In the present case, we see substantial compliance by the police with the required procedure on the custody and control of the confiscated items, thus showing that the integrity of the seized evidence was not compromised. We refer particularly to the succession of events established by evidence, to the overall handling of the seized items by specified individuals, to the test results obtained, under a situation where no objection to admissibility was ever raised by the defense. All these, to the unprejudiced mind, show that the evidence seized were the same evidence tested and subsequently identified and testified to in court.[14] x x xOur RulingWe deny the appeal.Appellants are charged under Section 13, Article II of R.A. No. 9165, which provides:Section 13. Possession of Dangerous Drugs During Parties, Social Gatherings or Meetings. \u2013 Any person found possessing any dangerous drug during a party, or at a social gathering or meeting, or in the proximate company of at least two (2) persons, shall suffer the maximum penalties provided for in Section 11 of this Act, regardless of the quantity and purity of such dangerous drugs.The elements for the illegal possession of dangerous drugs under Section 13 of R.A. No. 9165 are the same as those for the violation of Section 11 of the law: (1) possession by the accused of an item or object identified to be a prohibited or dangerous drug; (2) such possession is not authorized by law; (3) the free and conscious possession of the drug by the accused,[15] with the additional element that (4) the accused possessed the prohibited or dangerous drug during a social gathering or meeting, or in the company of at least two persons.As correctly found by the CA, the evidence for the prosecution showed the presence of all these elements. The testimony of PO2 Bautista on this point is determinative: q. When you said PO3 Parunggao saw that the door of the house was not locked, what did you do? a. He entered the house and we followed him, maam [sic]. x x x x q. In what part of the house where [sic] this [sic] people engaged in a pot session? a. At the sala, maam [sic]. q.

You said that you saw PO3 Parunggao confiscated [sic] plastic sachet containing shabu from Jeric Pavia, from what part of his body was he able to confiscate the same? a. From the pocket of Jeric Pavia, maam [sic]. q. And do you know what PO3 Parunggao do with the item? a. He placed marking on it, maam [sic]. q. In what place did he put the marking? a.

It is a small transparent plastic sachet which contains white crystalline substance otherwise known as shabu, maam [sic]. q. Who was in possession of the plastic sachet from the time PO3 Parunggao took it from the possession of Jeric Pavia up to the police station? a. It was P03 Parunggao, maam [sic]. q. I am showing to you a plastic sachet with white crystalline substance with markings JP, please identify the same? a. This is the same item confiscated from Jeric Pavia, maam [sic]. x x x x q. Did you come to know what Officer Parunggao do with the plastic sachet confiscated from Juan Buendia? a. He brought it to the police station, maam [sic]. q. And what did he do with it? a. He placed the markings JB, maam [sic]. q. Who was in possession of the plastic sachet with markings JB from Aplaya [where the pot session took place] to the police station? a. It was PO3 Parunggao, maam. q. I am showing to you a plastic sachet with white crystalline substance with markings JB, please identify the same? a. This is the same item confiscated from Juan Buendia by PO3 Parunggao, maam [sic].[17] It is likewise important to note that it was PO2 Bautista himself who brought the request[18] for laboratory examination of the substance taken from appellants from the San Pedro Police Station to the PNP Crime Laboratory in Calamba City, thereby ensuring that the integrity of the confiscated items are preserved. Thus, the fact that the apprehending team did not strictly comply with the procedural requirements of Section 21(1), Article II of R.A. No. 9165 does not necessarily render appellants\u2019 arrest illegal or the items seized from them inadmissible in evidence.As held by this Court in the case of People v. Llanita:[19]RA 9165 and its subsequent Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR) do not require strict compliance as to the chain of custody rule. x x x. We have emphasized that what is essential is \u201cthe preservation of the integrity and the evidentiary value of the seized items, as the same would be utilized in the determination of the guilt or innocence of the accused.\u201dBriefly stated, non-compliance with the procedural requirements under RA 9165 and its IRR relative to the custody, photographing, and drug-testing of the apprehended persons, is not a serious flaw that can render void the seizures and custody of drugs in a buy-bust operation.x x x xx x x. We recognize that the strict compliance with the requirements of Section 21 may not always be possible under field conditions; the police operates under varied conditions, and cannot at all times attend to all the niceties of the procedures in the handling of confiscated evidence.Finally, both the trial court and the CA rejected appellants\u2019 defense of denial and frame-up for failure to substantiate the same.Indeed, the defenses of denial and frame-up have been invariably viewed by this Court with disfavor for it can easily be concocted and is a common and standard defense ploy in prosecutions for violations of the Dangerous Drugs Act. In order to prosper, the defenses of denial and frame-up must be proved with strong and convincing evidence. In the case before us, appellants failed to present sufficient evidence in support of their claims. Aside from their self-serving assertions, no plausible proof was presented to bolster their allegations.[20] Consequently, in the absence of clear and convincing evidence that the police officers were inspired by any improper motive, this Court will not appreciate the defense of denial or frame-up and instead apply the presumption of regularity in the performance of official duty by law enforcement agents.[21]In view of the foregoing, we see no reason to deviate from the well-discussed decision of the CA, its findings and conclusions having been supported by both law and applicable jurisprudence.WHEREFORE, the Decision of the Court of Appeals dated 7 February 2012 in CA-G.R.

CR-H.C. No. 04020. The CA affirmed the Judgment [2] of the Regional Trial Court (RTC), Branch 31, San Pedro, Laguna which found appellants guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the offense of illegal possession of dangerous drugs punishable under Section 13, Article II of Republic Act (R.A.) No. 9165. Appellants were sentenced to suffer the penalty of life imprisonment and to pay a fine of P500,000.00.\n\nThe Antecedents\n\nOn 29 March 2005, at around 6:00 in the evening, a confidential informant reported to SPO3 Melchor dela Pe\u00f1a (SPO3 Dela Pe\u00f1a) of the San Pedro Municipal Police Station, San Pedro, Laguna, that a pot session was taking place at the house of a certain \u201cObet\u201d located at Barangay Cuyab, San Pedro, Laguna. Upon receipt of the information, SPO3 Dela Pe\u00f1a formed a team to conduct police operations against the suspect. The team was composed of the confidential informant, PO2 Rommel Bautista (PO2 Bautista), PO3 Jay Parunggao (PO3 Parunggao), PO1 Jifford Signap and SPO3 Dela Pe\u00f1a as team leader. [3]\n\nAt around 9:00 in the evening of the same date, the team proceeded to the target area. When the team arrived, the members saw that Obet\u2019s house was closed. Since the house was not surrounded by a fence, PO2 Bautista approached the house and peeped through a small opening in a window where he saw four persons in a circle having a pot session in the living room. PO3 Parunggao then tried to find a way to enter the house and found an unlocked door. He entered the house, followed by PO2 Bautista and they caught the four persons engaged in a pot session by surprise. After they introduced themselves as police officers, they arrested the four suspects and seized the drug paraphernalia found at the scene. [4] Among those arrested were herein appellants, from each of whom a plastic sachet containing white crystalline substance were confiscated by PO3 Parunggao after he conducted a body search on their persons. [5] PO3 Parunggao marked the plastic sachet he seized from appellant Pavia with \u201cJP,\u201d representing the initials of Jeric Pavia while that taken from appellant Buendia was marked, also by PO3 Parunggao, with \u201cJB,\u201d representing the initials of Juan Buendia. [6] These plastic sachets were transmitted to the crime laboratory for qualitative examination where they tested positive for \u201cshabu .\u201d [7]\n\nConsequently, appellants were charged with violation of Section 13, Article II of R.A. No. 9165 in two separate but identically worded informations which read:\n\nThat on or about 29 March 2005, in the Municipality of San Pedro, Province of Laguna, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court accused without authority of the law, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously have in his possession, control and custody [of] METHAMPHETAMINE HYDROCHLORIDE, commonly known as shabu, a dangerous drug, weighing zero point zero two (0.02) gram, in the company of two persons. [8]\nWhen arraigned, both appellants pleaded not guilty to the offense. [9]\n\nA joint trial of the cases ensued.\n\nIn defense, appellants provided a different version of the incident. According to them, on the questioned date and time, they were roaming the streets of Baranggay Cuyab, selling star apples. A prospective buyer of the fruits called them over to his house and requested them to go inside, to which they acceded. When they were about to leave the house, several persons who introduced themselves as policemen arrived and invited appellants to go with them to the precinct. There, they were incarcerated and falsely charged with violation of the Comprehensive Drugs Act of 2002. [10]\n\nThe Ruling of the RTC\n\nThe trial court found that the prosecution was able to prove the offense charged through the spontaneous, positive and credible testimony of its witness. The trial court noted that the police officers carried out a lawful arrest before they proceeded with the bodily search of appellants. Moreover, there was no clear and convincing evidence that the team of PO3 Parunggao was inspired by any improper motive when they carried out their operation. Thus, the testimony of PO2 Bautista on the witness stand, narrating the events leading to the apprehension of appellants, deserves full faith and credit. [11]\n\nThe Ruling of the Court of Appeals\n\nOn appeal, the CA affirmed the decision of the RTC, upon a finding that the evidence on record support the trial court\u2019s conclusion that a lawful arrest, search and seizure took place, and that the prosecution fully discharged its burden of establishing, beyond reasonable doubt, all the elements necessary for the conviction of the offense charged. [12]\n\nOn the contention of appellants that their warrantless arrest was illegal and, therefore, the items seized from them as a result of that arrest were inadmissible in evidence against them, the CA held that this argument totally lacks merit. According to the CA:\n\nWe stress at the outset that the [appellants] failed to question the legality of their warrantless arrest. The established rule is that an accused [is] estopped from assailing the legality of [his] arrest if [he] failed to move for the quashing of the Information against [him] before [his] arraignment. Any objection involving the arrest or the procedure in the court\u2019s acquisition of jurisdiction over the person of an accused must be made before [he] enter[s] [his] plea; otherwise, the objection is deemed waived.\n\nIn any event, we carefully examined the records and now hold that the warrantless arrests conducted on [appellants] were valid. Section 5, Rule 113 of the Rules on Criminal Procedure lists the situations when a person may be arrested without a warrant x x x.\n\nx x x x\n\nParagraph (a) of Section 5 is commonly known as an in flagrante delicto arrest. For a warrantless arrest of an accused caught in flagrante delicto to be valid, two requisites must concur: (1) the person to be arrested must execute an overt act indicating that he has just committed, is actually committing, or is attempting to commit a crime; and (2) such overt act is done in the presence or within the view of the arresting officer.\n\nAfter a careful evaluation of the evidence in its totality, we hold that the prosecution successfully established that the petitioner was arrested in flagrante delicto.\n\nWe emphasize that the series of events that led the police to the house where the pot session was conducted and to their arrest were triggered by a \u201ctip\u201d from a concerned citizen that a \u201cpot session\u201d was in progress at the house of a certain \u201cObet \u201d at Baranggay Cuyab, San Pedro, Laguna. Under the circumstances, the police did not have enough time to secure a search warrant considering the \u201ctime element\u201d involved in the process (i.e., a pot session may not be an extended period of time and it was then 9:00 p.m.). In view of the urgency, SPO3 Melchor dela Pe\u00f1a immediately dispatched his men to proceed to the identified place to verify the report. At the place, the responding police officers verified through a small opening in the window and saw the accused-appellants and their other two (2) companions sniffing \u201c shabu \u201d to use the words of PO2 Bautista. There was therefore sufficient probable cause for the police officers to believe that the accused-appellants were then and there committing a crime. As it turned out, the accused-appellants indeed possessed and were even using a prohibited drug, contrary to law. When an accused is caught in flagrante delicto , the police officers are not only authorized but are duty-bound to arrest him even without a warrant.\n\nIn the course of the arrest and in accordance with police procedures, the [appellants] were frisked, which search yielded the prohibited drug in their possession. These circumstances were sufficient to justify the warrantless search x x x that yielded two (2) heat-sealed plastic sachets of \u201c shabu .\u201d x x x\n\nx x x x\n\nAll the x x x requirements for a lawful search and seizure are present in this case. The police officers had prior justification to be at a certain \u201cObet\u2019s\u201d place as they were dispatched by their desk officer; they arrested the [appellants] as they had reason to believe that they were illegally using and possessing a prohibited drug and drug paraphernalia. The search of the [appellants] incident to their arrest yielded the confiscated crystalline substance which later proved to be \u201cshabu\u201d. In the course of their lawful intrusion, they inadvertently saw the various drug paraphernalia scattered in the living room. As these items were plainly visible, the police officers were justified in seizing them.\n\nx x x x\n\nAs correctly found by the trial court, the [appellants'] story is unworthy of belief. Their denial must fail in the light of the positive identification and declarations made by the prosecution witness. As stated earlier, PO2 Bautista testified in a straightforward and categorical manner regarding the identities of the malefactors. He did not waver despite the defense counsel's rigid questioning.\n\nCourts generally view the defense of denial with disfavor due to the facility with which an accused can concoct it to suit his or her defense. As evidence that is both negative and self-serving, this defense cannot attain more credibility than the testimony of the prosecution witness who testified clearly, providing thereby positive evidence on the various aspects of the crime committed. One such positive evidence is the result of the laboratory examination conducted by the PNP crime Laboratory on the drugs recovered from the [appellants] which revealed that the confiscated plastic sachets tested positive for the presence of \"shabu\u201d: two (2) heated transparent plastic sachet with markings \u201cJB\u201d and \u201cJP\u201d containing 0.02 gram of white crystalline substance each both yielded positive results. [13]\nWith respect to appellants\u2019 claim that the prosecution failed to establish the chain of custody because the police operatives failed to strictly comply with Section 21 (1) of R.A. No. 9165, the CA has this to say:\n\nThe chain of custody rule requires that the admission of an exhibit be preceded by evidence sufficient to support a finding that the matter in question is what the proponent claims it to be.\n\nContrary to what the [appellants] want to portray, the chain of custody of the seized prohibited drug was shown not to have been broken. After the seizure of the plastic sachets containing white crystalline substance from the [appellants'] possession and of the various drug paraphernalia in the living room, the police immediately brought the [appellants] to the police station, together with the seized items. PO3 Parunggao himself brought these items to the police station and marked them. The plastic sachets containing white crystalline substance was marked \"JB\" and \"JP\". These confiscated items were immediately turned over by PO2 Bautista to the PNP Regional Crime Laboratory Office Calabarzon, Camp Vicente Lim, Calamba City for examination to determine the presence of dangerous drugs. After a qualitative examination conducted on the specimens, Forensic Chemist Lorna Ravelas Tria concluded that the plastic sachets recovered from the accused-appellants tested positive for methylamphetamine hydrochloride, a prohibited drug, per Chemistry Report Nos. D-0381-05 and D-0382-05.\n\nWhen the prosecution presented these marked specimens in court, PO2 Baustista positively identified them to be the same items they seized from the [appellants] and which PO3 Parunggao later marked at the police station, from where the seized items were turned over to the laboratory for examination based on a duly prepared request.\n\nThus, the prosecution established the crucial link in the chain of custody of the seized items from the time they were first discovered until they were brought for examination. Besides, as earlier stated, the [appellants] did not contest the admissibility of the seized items during the tria1. The integrity and the evidentiary value of the drugs seized from the accused-appellants were therefore duly proven not to have been compromised.\n\nJurisprudence teems with pronouncements that failure to strictly comply, with Section 2l (1), Article II of R.A. No. 9165 does not necessarily render an accused's arrest illegal or the items seized or confiscated from him inadmissible. What is of utmost importance is the preservation of the integrity and the evidentiary value of the seized items, as these would be utilized in the determination of the guilt or innocence of the accused. In the present case, we see substantial compliance by the police with the required procedure on the custody and control of the confiscated items, thus showing that the integrity of the seized evidence was not compromised. We refer particularly to the succession of events established by evidence, to the overall handling of the seized items by specified individuals, to the test results obtained, under a situation where no objection to admissibility was ever raised by the defense. All these, to the unprejudiced mind, show that the evidence seized were the same evidence tested and subsequently identified and testified to in court. [14] x x x\n\nOur Ruling\n\nWe deny the appeal.\n\nAppellants are charged under Section 13, Article II of R.A. No. 9165, which provides:\n\nSection 13. Possession of Dangerous Drugs During Parties, Social Gatherings or Meetings . \u2013 Any person found possessing any dangerous drug during a party, or at a social gathering or meeting, or in the proximate company of at least two (2) persons, shall suffer the maximum penalties provided for in Section 11 of this Act, regardless of the quantity and purity of such dangerous drugs.\nThe elements for the illegal possession of dangerous drugs under Section 13 of R.A. No. 9165 are the same as those for the violation of Section 11 of the law: (1) possession by the accused of an item or object identified to be a prohibited or dangerous drug; (2) such possession is not authorized by law; (3) the free and conscious possession of the drug by the accused, [15] with the additional element that (4) the accused possessed the prohibited or dangerous drug during a social gathering or meeting, or in the company of at least two persons.\n\nAs correctly found by the CA, the evidence for the prosecution showed the presence of all these elements. The testimony of PO2 Bautista on this point is determinative:\n\n[TABLE_CONTENT]\nq. | When you said PO3 Parunggao saw that the door of the house was not locked, what did you do?\na. | He entered the house and we followed him, maam [sic].\nx x x x | \nq. | In what part of the house where [sic] this [sic] people engaged in a pot session?\na. | At the sala, maam [sic].\nq. | And what was their reaction when PO3 Parunggao and the rest of the team barged in?\na. | They were surprised, maam [sic].\nx x x x | \nq. | And what did you do after that?\na. | PO3 Parunggao introduced ourselves as police officers, maam [sic].\nq. | What happened after that?\na. | We confiscated the drug paraphernalias [sic] and then PO3 Parunggao conducted body search and was able to confiscate shabu from the two of the people there maam [sic].\nq. | Where were you when PO3 Parunggao conducted a search?\na. | I was behind him, maam [sic].\nq. | Did you see him conducting a search?\na. | Yes, maam [sic].\nq. | What did you see him doing?\na. | I saw that he was able to confiscate small plastic sachet containing shabu, maam [sic].\nq. | From whom?\na. | From Jeric Pavia and Juan Buendia, maam [sic].\nq. | If this Jeric Pavia is in court right now, will you be able to point to him?\na. | Yes, maam [sic].\nq. | Please point to him?\na. | That man in the first row wearing yellow shirt, maam [sic] (pointed to a person inside the courtroom who, when asked answered by the name of Jeric Pavia).\nq. | You said that you saw PO3 Parunggao confiscated plastic sachet containing shabu from Jeric Pavia, from what part of his body was he able to confiscate the same?\na. | From the pocket of Jeric Pavia, maam [sic].\nx x x x | \nq. | You said that PO3 Parunggao confiscated plastic sachet with white crystalline substance from two person [sic], one was identified as Jeric Pavia, who was the other one?\na. | It was Juan Buendia, maam [sic]\nq. | Please identify him if he is in court?\na. | That man also in the first row, at the right portion, wearing yellow shirt (pointed to a person who, when asked answered by the name of Juan Buendia).\nq. | Where were you when PO3 Parunggao confiscated from Juan Buendia the plastic sachet of shabu?\na. | I was behind him, maam [sic].\nx x x x | \nq. | On [sic] what part of the body of Juan Buendia was the item taken by Officer Parunggao?\na. | Also in [sic] his pocket, maam [sic].[16]\n[END_TABLE]\n\nq.

This is the same item confiscated from Juan Buendia by PO3 Parunggao, maam [sic]. [17]\nIt is likewise important to note that it was PO2 Bautista himself who brought the request [18] for laboratory examination of the substance taken from appellants from the San Pedro Police Station to the PNP Crime Laboratory in Calamba City, thereby ensuring that the integrity of the confiscated items are preserved. Thus, the fact that the apprehending team did not strictly comply with the procedural requirements of Section 21(1), Article II of R.A. No. 9165 does not necessarily render appellants\u2019 arrest illegal or the items seized from them inadmissible in evidence.\n\nAs held by this Court in the case of People v. Llanita: [19]\n\nRA 9165 and its subsequent Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR) do not require strict compliance as to the chain of custody rule. x x x. We have emphasized that what is essential is \u201cthe preservation of the integrity and the evidentiary value of the seized items, as the same would be utilized in the determination of the guilt or innocence of the accused.\u201d\n\nBriefly stated, non-compliance with the procedural requirements under RA 9165 and its IRR relative to the custody, photographing, and drug-testing of the apprehended persons, is not a serious flaw that can render void the seizures and custody of drugs in a buy-bust operation.\n\nx x x x\n\nx x x. We recognize that the strict compliance with the requirements of Section 21 may not always be possible under field conditions; the police operates under varied conditions, and cannot at all times attend to all the niceties of the procedures in the handling of confiscated evidence.\nFinally, both the trial court and the CA rejected appellants\u2019 defense of denial and frame-up for failure to substantiate the same.\n\nIndeed, the defenses of denial and frame-up have been invariably viewed by this Court with disfavor for it can easily be concocted and is a common and standard defense ploy in prosecutions for violations of the Dangerous Drugs Act.\u00a0 In order to prosper, the defenses of denial and frame-up must be proved with strong and convincing evidence.\u00a0 In the case before us, appellants failed to present sufficient evidence in support of their claims. Aside from their self-serving assertions, no plausible proof was presented to bolster their allegations. [20] Consequently, in the absence of clear and convincing evidence that the police officers were inspired by any improper motive, this Court will not appreciate the defense of denial or frame-up and instead apply the presumption of regularity in the performance of official duty by law enforcement agents. [21]\n\nIn view of the foregoing, we see no reason to deviate from the well-discussed decision of the CA, its findings and conclusions having been supported by both law and applicable jurisprudence.\n\nWHEREFORE , the Decision of the Court of Appeals dated 7 February 2012 in CA-G.R.

      "title": "CIVIL SERVICE COMMISSION, PETITIONER, VS. MARIA RIZA G. VERGEL DE DIOS, RESPONDENT.D E C I S I O N VILLARAMA, JR., J.: Before us is a petition for review on certiorari assailing the Amended Decision[1] dated March 21, 2012 and Resolution[2] dated September 17, 2012 of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. SP No. 114040. The CA set aside its Decision[3] dated October 20, 2011 which upheld the resolutions of the Civil Service Commission (CSC) dismissing respondent Maria Riza G. Vergel de Dios from the service.The facts follow.The CSC conducted an investigation after receiving an anonymous complaint that several employees of San Rafael Water District employed a fixer to pass the CSC\u2019s Career Service Professional Examination on November 17, 2000. In the course of the investigation, CSC Director Aurora C. De Leon received a phone call implicating respondent in the alleged irregularity. Director De Leon\u2019s verification with the Integrated Records Management Office of the Central Office of the CSC revealed that there were discrepancies in the signatures and pictures of the respondent in her personal data sheets and on the picture seat plan used for said examination. Thus, respondent was formally charged for dishonesty, grave misconduct, falsification of official documents and conduct prejudicial to the best interest of the service.In her defense, respondent testified that she was the one who took the examination. Loline[4] Padilla testified that she accompanied respondent when she took the examination. Padilla admitted however that she never saw respondent take the examination.In its Decision[5] dated August 26, 2008, the CSC Regional Office No. III found respondent guilty of serious dishonesty, grave misconduct, and falsification of official documents, and dismissed her from the service. The CSC Regional Office found that the picture pasted and the signature appearing on the picture seat plan of the Career Service Professional Examination held at the CSC Central Office on November 17, 2000 is different from the pictures pasted and signatures appearing on respondent\u2019s personal data sheet accomplished on March 13, 2001 and personal data sheet accomplished on July 14, 2006.[6] Respondent\u2019s motion for reconsideration was denied.The CSC dismissed respondent\u2019s appeal in its Resolution No. 091721[7] dated December 11, 2009. The dispositive portion thereof provides:WHEREFORE, the appeal of Maria Riza G. Vergel de Dios, former Public Relations Officer A, San Rafael Water District, San Rafael, Bulacan, is hereby DISMISSED. Accordingly, the Decision dated August 26, 2008 rendered by the Civil Service Commission Regional Office (CSCRO) No. III, San Fernando City, Pampanga finding her guilty of Serious Dishonesty, Grave Misconduct and Falsification of Official Document and imposing upon her the penalty of dismissal from the service including its accessory penalties of cancellation of eligibility, forfeiture of retirement benefits, disqualification from taking future civil service examinations and perpetual disqualification from re-entering the government service, is hereby AFFIRMED.[8]The CSC agreed with its Regional Office that (1) the Vergel de Dios in the picture seat plan is not the same Vergel de Dios whose picture is pasted in the personal data sheet and (2) the signatures appearing therein pertain to different individuals.[9] The CSC added:The submitted documents show that the picture of Vergel de Dios as affixed in the [personal data sheet] is obviously not the Maria Riza G. Vergel de Dios whose picture appears on the [picture seat plan]. This may be seen in the discrepancies in her facial features specifically the size of her head, the prominence of the forehead, shape of her eyebrows, the difference of the full-face view, the projection of the nose, the round shape of the face and the forehead, among others. Moreover, the signatures of the respondent as affixed in the Picture Seat Plan (PSP) reflects a glaring difference to the signature affixed in her Personal Data Sheet (PDS) accomplished on February 27, 2001. Such difference in the manner by which the respective signatures were done clearly shows that they were made by two different persons.[10]In its Resolution No. 100728[11] dated April 12, 2010, the CSC denied respondent\u2019s motion for reconsideration.In its Decision dated October 20, 2011, the CA dismissed respondent\u2019s petition for review and agreed with the findings of the CSC. The fallo of the CA decision reads:WHEREFORE, premises considered, the petition is hereby DISMISSED. The assailed Resolution Nos. 091721 and 100728 dated 11 December 2009 and 12 April 2010, respectively, of the Civil Service Commission are hereby AFFIRMED.SO ORDERED.[12]On reconsideration, the CA issued the assailed Amended Decision dated March 21, 2012 which set aside its Decision dated October 20, 2011 and reversed the CSC resolutions, to wit:WHEREFORE, the earlier Decision of this Court dated 20 October 2011 is hereby RECALLED and SET ASIDE and a new one is entered GRANTING the instant petition. Resolution No. 091721 dated 11 December 2009 and Resolution No. 100728, both issued by the Civil Service Commission, are hereby REVERSED and SET ASIDE.SO ORDERED.[13]While the CA recognized the CSC\u2019s strict procedures to ensure the integrity of its examinations, the CA said that there is no showing that those procedures were followed when the purported impersonation subject of this case happened. The CA noted that the room examiners were not presented to prove that the examination procedures were strictly implemented. Thus, the CA held that the discrepancy in respondent\u2019s signatures and pictures on the personal data sheets and picture seat plan can be the result of a simple mix up.[14]The assailed Resolution dated September 17, 2012 denied the CSC\u2019s motion for reconsideration.Hence, this petition with the sole assignment of error:x x x THE x x x COURT OF APPEALS DECIDED A QUESTION OF SUBSTANCE IN A WAY NOT IN ACCORD WITH LAW AND WITH THE APPLICABLE DECISIONS OF THE SUPREME COURT x x x.[15]The main issue is whether the CA erred in reversing the ruling of the CSC on the ground that the discrepancies in respondent\u2019s pictures and signatures in the picture seat plan and personal data sheets were due to a possible mix up.Petitioner argues that the presentation of the room examiners is not required to prove the observance of the procedure in preparing the picture seat plan and in implementing the civil service examination because of the presumption of regularity in the performance of official duty in favor of public officers. Petitioner also argues that the personal data sheet and picture seat plan are public documents which are admissible in evidence without proof of authenticity and due execution thereof. Petitioner avers that the discrepancy in the signature and picture of the respondent in her personal data sheet and picture seat plan is tantamount to the commission of misrepresentation in the personal data sheet and fraudulent procurement of civil service eligibility.Respondent counters that despite the presumption of regularity in the performance of official duty in favor of public officers, the room examiners must still be presented to prove that the examination procedures were complied with. Respondent asserts that the issuance of her Certificate of Eligibility is also presumed regular.The petition is meritorious.We reverse the ruling of the CA that the discrepancies in respondent\u2019s signatures and pictures on the personal data sheets and picture seat plan can be the result of a simple mix up. This ruling is pure speculation and is belied by the evidence on record.Written on the picture seat plan is the name of respondent in bold letters.[16] On top of it is her purported signature. Notably, respondent said that she was the one who took the examination. If we believe her, then she was the one who wrote her name in bold letters and put the signature on top of it. Thus, there was no mix up in her signature on the picture seat plan.Upon comparison of respondent\u2019s signatures, the CSC found that respondent\u2019s signature on the picture seat plan is different from her signatures on her personal data sheets. We also examined respondent\u2019s signatures on the picture seat plan and personal data sheet[17] and we agree with the CSC that the signatures are different. We also agree with the CSC that the pictures of respondent on the picture seat plan and personal data sheets are different. If only to stress, we again quote the finding of the CSC:The submitted documents show that the picture of Vergel de Dios as affixed in the [personal data sheet] is obviously not the Maria Riza G. Vergel de Dios whose picture appears on the [picture seat plan]. This may be seen in the discrepancies in her facial features specifically the size of her head, the prominence of the forehead, shape of her eyebrows, the difference of the full-face view, the projection of the nose, the round shape of the face and the forehead, among others. Moreover, the signatures of the respondent as affixed in the Picture Seat Plan (PSP) reflects a glaring difference to the signature affixed in her Personal Data Sheet (PDS) accomplished on February 27, 2001. Such difference in the manner by which the respective signatures were done clearly shows that they were made by two different persons.[18]As we said in Office of the Court Administrator v. Bermejo[19]:It is difficult to believe that respondent could not have noticed that her picture was put on top of a different name and that her name was accompanied by the picture of another person. There was a space provided for the signature of the examinee. Thus, respondent could not have missed that she was signing \u2013 if indeed she was signing her own name \u2013 the box with a different picture. She proffers no sufficient explanation for this discrepancy.We thus entertain no doubt that someone impersonated respondent and took the examination for her.We also agree with petitioner that the presentation of the room examiners is not required to prove the observance of the procedure in preparing the picture seat plan and in implementing the civil service examination. More so in this case where the supposed mix up in the picture seat plan was proven wrong by the records. We stress that CSC examiners enjoy a presumption of regularity in the administration of the civil service examination. We held in Donato, Jr. v. Civil Service Commission[20] that:x x x Those government employees who prepared the [picture seat plan] and who supervised the conduct of the Career Service Sub-Professional Examination on August 5, 1990, enjoy the presumption that they regularly performed their duties and this presumption cannot be disputed by mere conjectures and speculations.In the present case, respondent failed to controvert aforesaid presumption. Thus, the CSC examiners are conclusively deemed to have regularly performed their duties in relation to the administration of the civil service examination.Similarly, there is also no need to present the room examiners to establish the authenticity and due execution of the picture seat plan. The picture seat plan is a public document which is admissible in evidence without need of proof of its authenticity and due execution.[21] Pertinently, Section 23, Rule 132 of the Rules of Court provides that \u201c[d]ocuments consisting of entries in public records made in the performance of a duty by a public officer are prima facie evidence of the facts therein stated.\u201d As a public document, the picture seat plan need not be identified or presented by the custodian thereof in order to be admissible in evidence.[22] In Antillon v. Barcelon,[23] we explained the legislative policy behind the admissibility of public documents, to wit: \u201c[w]ere there no exception for official statements, hosts of officials would be found devoting the greater part of their time to attending as witnesses in the court or delivering their depositions before an officer.\u201dRespondent committed serious dishonesty[24] when she declared in her personal data sheet that she took and passed the civil service examination on November 17, 2000. The evidence at hand also disproved her testimony that she herself took the examination. In Advincula v. Dicen,[25] we referred to the personal data sheet as the repository of all relevant information about any government employee or official. Thus, we declared that concealment of any information therein warrants the imposition of administrative penalty. Specifically, in De Guzman v. Delos Santos,[26] we ruled that the making of an untruthful statement in the personal data sheet amounts to dishonesty and falsification of official document, which warrant dismissal from service upon commission of the first offense.Civil service rules also provide that any act which includes the fraudulent procurement and/or use of fake/spurious civil service eligibility, the giving of assistance to ensure the commission or procurement of the same, or any other act which amounts to violation of the integrity of civil service examinations is to be categorized as grave offense of dishonesty, grave misconduct or conduct prejudicial to the best interest of the service.[27]Respondent must therefore be held administratively liable for serious dishonesty, grave misconduct, and falsification of official document in view of her misrepresentation in the personal data sheet and the commission of fraud in connection with the civil service examination on November 17, 2000.WHEREFORE, the petition for review on certiorari is hereby GRANTED. The Amended Decision dated March 21, 2012 and Resolution dated September 17, 2012 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 114040 are REVERSED and SET ASIDE. The Resolution No. 091721 dated December 11, 2009 and Resolution No. 100728 dated April 12, 2010 of the Civil Service Commission are REINSTATED and UPHELD.No costs.SO ORDERED.Velasco, Jr., (Chairperson), Peralta, Del Castillo,* and Reyes, JJ., concur.February 18, 2015N O T I C E OF J U D G M E N TSirs/Mesdames:Please take notice that on ___February 4, 2015___ a Decision, copy attached herewith, was rendered by the Supreme Court in the above-entitled case, the original of which was received by this Office on February 18, 2015 at 2:00 p.m.Very truly yours,(SGD)WILFREDO V.

No. 203536, February 04, 2015 ]\n\nCIVIL SERVICE COMMISSION, PETITIONER, VS. MARIA RIZA G. VERGEL DE DIOS, RESPONDENT.D E C I S I O N\nCIVIL SERVICE COMMISSION, PETITIONER, VS. MARIA RIZA G. VERGEL DE DIOS, RESPONDENT.\n\nD E C I S I O N\n\nVILLARAMA, JR., J.:\n\nBefore us is a petition for review on certiorari assailing the Amended Decision [1] dated March 21, 2012 and Resolution [2] dated September 17, 2012 of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. SP No. 114040.\u00a0 The CA set aside its Decision [3] dated October 20, 2011 which upheld the resolutions of the Civil Service Commission (CSC) dismissing respondent Maria Riza G. Vergel de Dios from the service.\n\nThe facts follow.\n\nThe CSC conducted an investigation after receiving an anonymous complaint that several employees of San Rafael Water District employed a fixer to pass the CSC\u2019s Career Service Professional Examination on November 17, 2000.\u00a0 In the course of the investigation, CSC Director Aurora C. De Leon received a phone call implicating respondent in the alleged irregularity.\u00a0 Director De Leon\u2019s verification with the Integrated Records Management Office of the Central Office of the CSC revealed that there were discrepancies in the signatures and pictures of the respondent in her personal data sheets and on the picture seat plan used for said examination.\u00a0 Thus, respondent was formally charged for dishonesty, grave misconduct, falsification of official documents and conduct prejudicial to the best interest of the service.\n\nIn her defense, respondent testified that she was the one who took the examination.\u00a0 Loline [4] Padilla testified that she accompanied respondent when she took the examination.\u00a0 Padilla admitted however that she never saw respondent take the examination.\n\nIn its Decision [5] dated August 26, 2008, the CSC Regional Office No. III found respondent guilty of serious dishonesty, grave misconduct, and falsification of official documents, and dismissed her from the service.\u00a0 The CSC Regional Office found that the picture pasted and the signature appearing on the picture seat plan of the Career Service Professional Examination held at the CSC Central Office on November 17, 2000 is different from the pictures pasted and signatures appearing on respondent\u2019s personal data sheet accomplished on March 13, 2001 and personal data sheet accomplished on July 14, 2006. [6] Respondent\u2019s motion for reconsideration was denied.\n\nThe CSC dismissed respondent\u2019s appeal in its Resolution No. 091721 [7] dated December 11, 2009.\u00a0 The dispositive portion thereof provides:\n\nWHEREFORE , the appeal of Maria Riza G. Vergel de Dios, former Public Relations Officer A, San Rafael Water District, San Rafael, Bulacan, is hereby DISMISSED. Accordingly, the Decision dated August 26, 2008 rendered by the Civil Service Commission Regional Office (CSCRO) No. III, San Fernando City, Pampanga finding her guilty of Serious Dishonesty, Grave Misconduct and Falsification of Official Document and imposing upon her the penalty of dismissal from the service including its accessory penalties of cancellation of eligibility, forfeiture of retirement benefits, disqualification from taking future civil service examinations and perpetual disqualification from re-entering the government service, is hereby AFFIRMED. [8]\n\nThe CSC agreed with its Regional Office that (1) the Vergel de Dios in the picture seat plan is not the same Vergel de Dios whose picture is pasted in the personal data sheet and (2) the signatures appearing therein pertain to different individuals. [9] The CSC added:\n\nThe submitted documents show that the picture of Vergel de Dios as affixed in the [personal data sheet] is obviously not the Maria Riza G. Vergel de Dios whose picture appears on the [picture seat plan].\u00a0 This may be seen in the discrepancies in her facial features specifically the size of her head, the prominence of the forehead, shape of her eyebrows, the difference of the full-face view, the projection of the nose, the round shape of the face and the forehead, among others.\u00a0 Moreover, the signatures of the respondent as affixed in the Picture Seat Plan (PSP) reflects a glaring difference to the signature affixed in her Personal Data Sheet (PDS) accomplished on February 27, 2001.\u00a0 Such difference in the manner by which the respective signatures were done clearly shows that they were made by two different persons. [10]\n\nIn its Resolution No. 100728 [11] dated April 12, 2010, the CSC denied respondent\u2019s motion for reconsideration.\n\nIn its Decision dated October 20, 2011, the CA dismissed respondent\u2019s petition for review and agreed with the findings of the CSC.\u00a0 The fallo of the CA decision reads:\n\nWHEREFORE , premises considered, the petition is hereby DISMISSED. The assailed Resolution Nos. 091721 and 100728 dated 11 December 2009 and 12 April 2010, respectively, of the Civil Service Commission are hereby AFFIRMED .\n\nSO ORDERED . [12]\n\nOn reconsideration, the CA issued the assailed Amended Decision dated March 21, 2012 which set aside its Decision dated October 20, 2011 and reversed the CSC resolutions, to wit:\n\nWHEREFORE , the earlier Decision of this Court dated 20 October 2011 is hereby RECALLED and SET ASIDE and a new one is entered GRANTING the instant petition.\u00a0 Resolution No. 091721 dated 11 December 2009 and Resolution No. 100728, both issued by the Civil Service Commission, are hereby REVERSED and SET ASIDE.\n\nSO ORDERED . [13]\n\nWhile the CA recognized the CSC\u2019s strict procedures to ensure the integrity of its examinations, the CA said that there is no showing that those procedures were followed when the purported impersonation subject of this case happened.\u00a0 The CA noted that the room examiners were not presented to prove that the examination procedures were strictly implemented.\u00a0 Thus, the CA held that the discrepancy in respondent\u2019s signatures and pictures on the personal data sheets and picture seat plan can be the result of a simple mix up. [14]\n\nThe assailed Resolution dated September 17, 2012 denied the CSC\u2019s motion for reconsideration.\n\nHence, this petition with the sole assignment of error:\n\nx x x THE x x x COURT OF APPEALS DECIDED A QUESTION OF SUBSTANCE IN A WAY NOT IN ACCORD WITH LAW AND WITH THE APPLICABLE DECISIONS OF THE SUPREME COURT x x x. [15]\nThe main issue is whether the CA erred in reversing the ruling of the CSC on the ground that the discrepancies in respondent\u2019s pictures and signatures in the picture seat plan and personal data sheets were due to a possible mix up.\n\nPetitioner argues that the presentation of the room examiners is not required to prove the observance of the procedure in preparing the picture seat plan and in implementing the civil service examination because of the presumption of regularity in the performance of official duty in favor of public officers.\u00a0 Petitioner also argues that the personal data sheet and picture seat plan are public documents which are admissible in evidence without proof of authenticity and due execution thereof.\u00a0 Petitioner avers that the discrepancy in the signature and picture of the respondent in her personal data sheet and picture seat plan is tantamount to the commission of misrepresentation in the personal data sheet and fraudulent procurement of civil service eligibility.\n\nRespondent counters that despite the presumption of regularity in the performance of official duty in favor of public officers, the room examiners must still be presented to prove that the examination procedures were complied with.\u00a0 Respondent asserts that the issuance of her Certificate of Eligibility is also presumed regular.\n\nThe petition is meritorious.\n\nWe reverse the ruling of the CA that the discrepancies in respondent\u2019s signatures and pictures on the personal data sheets and picture seat plan can be the result of a simple mix up.\u00a0 This ruling is pure speculation and is belied by the evidence on record.\n\nWritten on the picture seat plan is the name of respondent in bold letters. [16] On top of it is her purported signature.\u00a0 Notably, respondent said that she was the one who took the examination.\u00a0 If we believe her, then she was the one who wrote her name in bold letters and put the signature on top of it.\u00a0 Thus, there was no mix up in her signature on the picture seat plan.\n\nUpon comparison of respondent\u2019s signatures, the CSC found that respondent\u2019s signature on the picture seat plan is different from her signatures on her personal data sheets.\u00a0 We also examined respondent\u2019s signatures on the picture seat plan and personal data sheet [17] and we agree with the CSC that the signatures are different.\u00a0 We also agree with the CSC that the pictures of respondent on the picture seat plan and personal data sheets are different.\u00a0 If only to stress, we again quote the finding of the CSC:\n\nThe submitted documents show that the picture of Vergel de Dios as affixed in the [personal data sheet] is obviously not the Maria Riza G. Vergel de Dios whose picture appears on the [picture seat plan].\u00a0 This may be seen in the discrepancies in her facial features specifically the size of her head, the prominence of the forehead, shape of her eyebrows, the difference of the full-face view, the projection of the nose, the round shape of the face and the forehead, among others.\u00a0 Moreover, the signatures of the respondent as affixed in the Picture Seat Plan (PSP) reflects a glaring difference to the signature affixed in her Personal Data Sheet (PDS) accomplished on February 27, 2001.\u00a0 Such difference in the manner by which the respective signatures were done clearly shows that they were made by two different persons. [18]\nAs we said in Office of the Court Administrator v. Bermejo [19] :\n\nIt is difficult to believe that respondent could not have noticed that her picture was put on top of a different name and that her name was accompanied by the picture of another person.\u00a0 There was a space provided for the signature of the examinee.\u00a0 Thus, respondent could not have missed that she was signing \u2013 if indeed she was signing her own name \u2013 the box with a different picture.\u00a0 She proffers no sufficient explanation for this discrepancy.\nWe thus entertain no doubt that someone impersonated respondent and took the examination for her.\n\nWe also agree with petitioner that the presentation of the room examiners is not required to prove the observance of the procedure in preparing the picture seat plan and in implementing the civil service examination.\u00a0 More so in this case where the supposed mix up in the picture seat plan was proven wrong by the records.\u00a0 We stress that CSC examiners enjoy a presumption of regularity in the administration of the civil service examination.\u00a0 We held in Donato, Jr. v. Civil Service Commission [20] that:\n\nx x x\u00a0 Those government employees who prepared the [picture seat plan] and who supervised the conduct of the Career Service Sub-Professional Examination on August 5, 1990, enjoy the presumption that they regularly performed their duties and this presumption cannot be disputed by mere conjectures and speculations.\nIn the present case, respondent failed to controvert aforesaid presumption.\u00a0 Thus, the CSC examiners are conclusively deemed to have regularly performed their duties in relation to the administration of the civil service examination.\n\nSimilarly, there is also no need to present the room examiners to establish the authenticity and due execution of the picture seat plan.\u00a0 The picture seat plan is a public document which is admissible in evidence without need of proof of its authenticity and due execution. [21] Pertinently, Section 23, Rule 132 of the Rules of Court provides that \u201c[d]ocuments consisting of entries in public records made in the performance of a duty by a public officer are prima facie evidence of the facts therein stated.\u201d\u00a0 As a public document, the picture seat plan need not be identified or presented by the custodian thereof in order to be admissible in evidence. [22] In Antillon v. Barcelon, [23] we explained the legislative policy behind the admissibility of public documents, to wit: \u201c[w]ere there no exception for official statements, hosts of officials would be found devoting the greater part of their time to attending as witnesses in the court or delivering their depositions before an officer.\u201d\n\nRespondent committed serious dishonesty [24] when she declared in her personal data sheet that she took and passed the civil service examination on November 17, 2000.\u00a0 The evidence at hand also disproved her testimony that she herself took the examination.\u00a0 In Advincula v. Dicen , [25] we referred to the personal data sheet as the repository of all relevant information about any government employee or official.\u00a0 Thus, we declared that concealment of any information therein warrants the imposition of administrative penalty. Specifically, in De Guzman v. Delos Santos , [26] we ruled that the making of an untruthful statement in the personal data sheet amounts to dishonesty and falsification of official document, which warrant dismissal from service upon commission of the first offense.\n\nCivil service rules also provide that any act which includes the fraudulent procurement and/or use of fake/spurious civil service eligibility, the giving of assistance to ensure the commission or procurement of the same, or any other act which amounts to violation of the integrity of civil service examinations is to be categorized as grave offense of dishonesty, grave misconduct or conduct prejudicial to the best interest of the service. [27]\n\nRespondent must therefore be held administratively liable for serious dishonesty, grave misconduct, and falsification of official document in view of her misrepresentation in the personal data sheet and the commission of fraud in connection with the civil service examination on November 17, 2000.\n\nWHEREFORE , the petition for review on certiorari is hereby GRANTED .\u00a0 The Amended Decision dated March 21, 2012 and Resolution dated September 17, 2012 of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 114040 are REVERSED and SET ASIDE. The Resolution No. 091721 dated December 11, 2009 and Resolution No. 100728 dated April 12, 2010 of the Civil Service Commission are REINSTATED and UPHELD.\n\nNo costs.\n\nSO ORDERED.\n\nVelasco, Jr., (Chairperson), Peralta, Del Castillo, * and Reyes, JJ., concur.\n\nFebruary 18, 2015\n\nN O T I C E OF J U D G M E N T\n\nSirs/Mesdames:\n\nPlease take notice that on ___ February 4, 2015 ___ a Decision, copy attached herewith, was rendered by the Supreme Court in the above-entitled case, the original of which was received by this Office on February 18, 2015 at 2:00 p.m.\n\nVery truly yours,\n(SGD)\nWILFREDO V.

HONORATA MENDOZA BOLANTE, RESPONDENT.D E C I S I O N PANGANIBAN, J.: Tax receipts and declarations are prima facie proofs of ownership or possession of the property for which such taxes have been paid. Coupled with proof of actual possession of the property, they may become the basis of a claim for ownership. By acquisitive prescription, possession in the concept of owner -- public, adverse, peaceful and uninterrupted -- may be converted to ownership. On the other hand, mere possession and occupation of land cannot ripen into ownership.The CaseBefore us is a Petition for Review on Certiorari of the March 19, 1999 Decision[1] of the Court of Appeals[2] (CA) in CA-GR CV No. 43423. The assailed Decision disposed as follows:[3]\"WHEREFORE, for all the foregoing, the decision of the trial court appealed from is REVERSED and SET ASIDE. In lieu thereof, judgment is hereby rendered declaring x x x Honorata Mendoza Bolante the rightful owner and possessor of the parcel of land which is the subject of this appeal.\"The FactsThe Petition herein refers to a parcel of land situated in Barangay Bangad, Binangonan, Province of Rizal, having an area of 1,728 square meters and covered by Tax Declaration No. 26-0027.The undisputed antecedents of this case are narrated by the Court of Appeals as follows:[4]\"The facts not disputed revealed that prior to 1954, the land was originally declared for taxation purposes in the name of Sinforoso Mendoza, father of [respondent] and married to Eduarda Apiado. Sinforoso died in 1930. [Petitioners] were the daughters of Margarito Mendoza. On the basis of an affidavit, the tax declaration in the name of Sinforoso Mendoza of the contested lot was cancelled and subsequently declared in the name of Margarito Mendoza. Margarito and Sinforoso are brothers. [Respondent] is the present occupant of the land. Earlier, on October 15, 1975, [respondent] and Miguel Mendoza, another brother of [petitioners], during the cadastral survey had a dispute on [the] ownership of the land.\"During the pre-trial conference, parties stipulated the following facts:\u20181) The land subject of the case was formerly declared for taxation purposes in the name of Sinforoso Mendoza prior to 1954 but is now declared in the name of Margarito Mendoza.2) \u2018The parties agree[d] as to the identity of the land subject of instant case.\u20183) [Petitioners] are the daughters of Margarito Mendoza while the [respondent] is the only daughter of Sinforoso Mendoza.'4) Margarito Mendoza and Sinforoso Mendoza [were] brothers, now deceased.\u20185) During the cadastral survey of the property on October 15, 1979 there was already a dispute between Honorata M. Bolante and Miguel Mendoza, brother of [petitioners].6) \u2018[Respondent was] occupying the property in question.\u2018The only issue involved [was] who [was] the lawful owner and possessor of the land subject of the case.\u2019\"After trial, the court a quo rendered its judgment in favor of [petitioners], the dispositive portion of which reads as follows:\u2018Wherefore, in view of the foregoing considerations, judgment is hereby rendered for the [petitioners] and against the [respondent]:\u20181. Declaring that the parcel of land situated in Bangad, Binangonan, Rizal covered by tax declaration no. 26-0027 in the name of Margarito Mendoza belong to his heirs, the [petitioners] herein;\u20182. Ordering [respondent] to vacate the property subject of the case and deliver possession thereof to the heirs of Margarito Mendoza.\u20183. Ordering the [respondent] to indemnify the [petitioners] in the sum of P10,000.00, as actual damages.\u20184. Ordering the [respondent] to pay the costs.\u2019\"Ruling of the Court of AppealsThe Court of Appeals reversed the trial court because the genuineness and the due execution of the affidavit allegedly signed by the respondent and her mother had not been sufficiently established. The notary public or anyone else who had witnessed the execution of the affidavit was not presented. No expert testimony or competent witness ever attested to the genuineness of the questioned signatures.The CA further ruled that the affidavit was insufficient to overcome the denial of respondent and her mother. The former testified that the latter, never having attended school, could neither read nor write. Respondent also said that she had never been called \"Leonor,\" which was how she was referred to in the affidavit.Moreover, the appellate court held that the probative value of petitioners\u2019 tax receipts and declarations paled in comparison with respondent\u2019s proof of ownership of the disputed parcel. Actual, physical, exclusive and continuous possession by respondent since 1985 indeed gave her a better title under Article 538 of the Civil Code.Hence, this Petition.[5]IssuesInsisting that they are the rightful owners of the disputed land, the petitioners allege that the CA committed these reversible errors:[6]\"1. xxx [I]n not considering the affidavit as an exception to the general rule that an affidavit is classified as hearsay evidence, unless the affiant is placed on the witness stand; and\"2. xxx [I]n holding that respondent has been in actual and physical possession, coupled with xxx exclusive and continuous possession of the land since 1985, which are evidence of the best kind of circumstance proving the claim of the title of ownership and enjoys the presumption of preferred possessor.\"The Court's RulingThe Petition has no merit.First Issue: Admissibility of the AffidavitPetitioners dispute the CA's ruling that the affidavit was not the best evidence of their father's ownership of the disputed land, because the \"affiant was not placed on the witness stand.\" They contend that it was unnecessary to present a witness to establish the authenticity of the affidavit because it was a declaration against respondent's interest and was an ancient document. As a declaration against interest, it was an exception to the hearsay rule. As a necessary and trustworthy document, it was admissible in evidence. And because it was executed on March 24, 1953, it was a self-authenticating ancient document.We quote below the pertinent portion of the appellate court's ruling:[7]\"While it is true that the affidavit was signed and subscribed before a notary public, the general rule is that affidavits are classified as hearsay evidence, unless affiants are placed on the witness stand (People's Bank and Trust Company vs. Leonidas, 207 SCRA 164). Affidavits are not considered the best evidence, if affiants are available as witnesses (Vallarta vs. Court of Appeals, 163 SCRA 587). The due execution of the affidavit was not sufficiently established. The notary public or others who saw that the document was signed or at least [could] confirm its recitals [were] not presented. There was no expert testimony or competent witness who attested to the genuineness of the questioned signatures. Worse, [respondent] denied the genuineness of her signature and that of her mother xxx. [Respondent] testified that her mother was an illiterate and as far as she knew her mother could not write because she had not attended school (p. 7, ibid). Her testimony was corroborated by Ma. Sales Bolante Basa, who said the [respondent's] mother was illiterate.\"The petitioners\u2019 allegations are untenable. Before a private document offered as authentic can be received in evidence, its due execution and authenticity must be proved first.[8] And before a document is admitted as an exception to the hearsay rule under the Dead Man's Statute, the offeror must show (a) that the declarant is dead, insane or unable to testify; (b) that the declaration concerns a fact cognizable by the declarant; (c) that at the time the declaration was made, he was aware that the same was contrary to his interest; and (d) that circumstances render improbable the existence of any motive to falsify.[9]In this case, one of the affiants happens to be the respondent, who is still alive and who testified that the signature in the affidavit was not hers. A declaration against interest is not admissible if the declarant is available to testify as a witness.[10] Such declarant should be confronted with the statement against interest as a prior inconsistent statement.The affidavit cannot be considered an ancient document either. An ancient document is one that is (1) more than 30 years old, (2) found in the proper custody, and (3) unblemished by any alteration or by any circumstance of suspicion.[11] It must on its face appear to be genuine. The petitioners herein failed, however, to explain how the purported signature of Eduarda Apiado could have been affixed to the subject affidavit if, according to the witness, she was an illiterate woman who never had any formal schooling. This circumstance casts suspicion on its authenticity.Not all notarized documents are exempted from the rule on authentication. Thus, an affidavit does not automatically become a public document just because it contains a notarial jurat. Furthermore, the affidavit in question does not state how the ownership of the subject land was transferred from Sinforoso Mendoza to Margarito Mendoza. By itself, an affidavit is not a mode of acquiring ownership.Second Issue: Preference of PossessionThe CA ruled that the respondent was the preferred possessor under Article 538 of the Civil Code because she was in notorious, actual, exclusive and continuous possession of the land since 1985. Petitioners dispute this ruling. They contend that she came into possession through force and violence, contrary to Article 536 of the Civil Code.We concede that despite their dispossession in 1985, the petitioners did not lose legal possession because possession cannot be acquired through force or violence.[12] To all intents and purposes, a possessor, even if physically ousted, is still deemed the legal possessor.[13] Indeed, anyone who can prove prior possession, regardless of its character, may recover such possession.[14]However, possession by the petitioners does not prevail over that of the respondent. Possession by the former before 1985 was not exclusive, as the latter also acquired it before 1985. The records show that the petitioners\u2019 father and brother, as well as the respondent and her mother were simultaneously in adverse possession of the land.Before 1985, the subject land was occupied and cultivated by the respondent's father (Sinforoso), who was the brother of petitioners' father (Margarito), as evidenced by Tax Declaration No. 26425.[15] When Sinforoso died in 1930, Margarito took possession of the land and cultivated it with his son Miguel. At the same time, respondent and her mother continued residing on the lot.When respondent came of age in 1948, she paid realty taxes for the years 1932-1948.[16] Margarito declared the lot for taxation in his name in 1953[17] and paid its realty taxes beginning 1952.[18] When he died, Miguel continued cultivating the land. As found by the CA, the respondent and her mother were living on the land, which was being tilled by Miguel until 1985 when he was physically ousted by the respondent.[19]Based on Article 538 of the Civil Code, the respondent is the preferred possessor because, benefiting from her father's tax declaration of the subject lot since 1926, she has been in possession thereof for a longer period. On the other hand, petitioners' father acquired joint possession only in 1952.Third Issue: Possession of Better RightFinally, the petitioners challenge the CA ruling that \"actual and physical coupled with the exclusive and continuous possession [by respondent] of the land since 1985\" proved her ownership of the disputed land. The respondent argues that she was legally presumed to possess the subject land with a just title since she possessed it in the concept of owner. Under Article 541 of the Code, she could not be obliged to show or prove such title.The respondent's contention is untenable. The presumption in Article 541 of the Civil Code is merely disputable; it prevails until the contrary is proven.[20] That is, one who is disturbed in one's possession shall, under this provision, be restored thereto by the means established by law.[21] Article 538 settles only the question of possession, and possession is different from ownership. Ownership in this case should be established in one of the ways provided by law.To settle the issue of ownership, we need to determine who between the claimants has proven acquisitive prescription.[22]Ownership of immovable property is acquired by ordinary prescription through possession for ten years.[23] Being the sole heir of her father, respondent showed through his tax receipt that she had been in possession of the land for more than ten years since 1932. When her father died in 1930, she continued to reside there with her mother. When she got married, she and her husband engaged in kaingin inside the disputed lot for their livelihood.[24]Respondent's possession was not disturbed until 1953 when the petitioners' father claimed the land. But by then, her possession, which was in the concept of owner -- public, peaceful, and uninterrupted[25] -- had already ripened into ownership. Furthermore she herself, after her father's demise, declared and paid realty taxes for the disputed land. Tax receipts and declarations of ownership for taxation, when coupled with proof of actual possession of the property, can be the basis of a claim for ownership through prescription.[26]In contrast, the petitioners, despite thirty-two years of farming the subject land, did not acquire ownership. It is settled that ownership cannot be acquired by mere occupation.[27] Unless coupled with the element of hostility toward the true owner,[28] occupation and use, however long, will not confer title by prescription or adverse possession. Moreover, the petitioners cannot claim that their possession was public, peaceful and uninterrupted. Although their father and brother arguably acquired ownership through extraordinary prescription because of their adverse possession for thirty-two years (1953-1985),[29] this supposed ownership cannot extend to the entire disputed lot, but must be limited to the portion that they actually farmed.We cannot sustain the petitioners' contention that their ownership of the disputed land was established before the trial court through the series of tax declarations and receipts issued in the name of Margarito Mendoza. Such documents prove that the holder has a claim of title over the property. Aside from manifesting a sincere desire to obtain title thereto, they announce the holder's adverse claim against the state and other interested parties.[30]However, tax declarations and receipts are not conclusive evidence of ownership.[31] At most, they constitute mere prima facie proof of ownership or possession of the property for which taxes have been paid.[32] In the absence of actual public and adverse possession, the declaration of the land for tax purposes does not prove ownership.[33] In sum, the petitioners' claim of ownership of the whole parcel has no legal basis.WHEREFORE, the Petition is DENIED and the assailed Decision and Resolution AFFIRMED.

HONORATA MENDOZA BOLANTE, RESPONDENT.\n\nD E C I S I O N\n\nPANGANIBAN, J.:\n\nTax receipts and declarations are prima facie proofs of ownership or possession of the property for which such taxes have been paid. Coupled with proof of actual possession of the property, they may become the basis of a claim for ownership. By acquisitive prescription, possession in the concept of owner -- public, adverse, peaceful and uninterrupted -- may be converted to ownership. On the other hand, mere possession and occupation of land cannot ripen into ownership.\n\nThe Case\n\nBefore us is a Petition for Review on Certiorari of the March 19, 1999 Decision [1] of the Court of Appeals [2] (CA) in CA-GR CV No. 43423. The assailed Decision disposed as follows: [3]\n\"WHEREFORE, for all the foregoing, the decision of the trial court appealed from is REVERSED and SET ASIDE . In lieu thereof, judgment is hereby rendered declaring x x x Honorata Mendoza Bolante the rightful owner and possessor of the parcel of land which is the subject of this appeal.\"\nThe Facts\n\nThe Petition herein refers to a parcel of land situated in Barangay Bangad, Binangonan, Province of Rizal, having an area of 1,728 square meters and covered by Tax Declaration No. 26-0027.\n\nThe undisputed antecedents of this case are narrated by the Court of Appeals as follows: [4]\n\"The facts not disputed revealed that prior to 1954, the land was originally declared for taxation purposes in the name of Sinforoso Mendoza, father of [respondent] and married to Eduarda Apiado. Sinforoso died in 1930. [Petitioners] were the daughters of Margarito Mendoza. On the basis of an affidavit, the tax declaration in the name of Sinforoso Mendoza of the contested lot was cancelled and subsequently declared in the name of Margarito Mendoza. Margarito and Sinforoso are brothers. [Respondent] is the present occupant of the land. Earlier, on October 15, 1975, [respondent] and Miguel Mendoza, another brother of [petitioners], during the cadastral survey had a dispute on [the] ownership of the land.\n\n\"During the pre-trial conference, parties stipulated the following facts:\n\n[TABLE_CONTENT]\n\u20181) | The land subject of the case was formerly declared for taxation purposes in the name of Sinforoso Mendoza prior to 1954 but is now declared in the name of Margarito Mendoza.\n | \n2) | \u2018The parties agree[d] as to the identity of the land subject of instant case.\n | \n\u20183) | [Petitioners] are the daughters of Margarito Mendoza while the [respondent] is the only daughter of Sinforoso Mendoza.\n | \n'4) | Margarito Mendoza and Sinforoso Mendoza [were] brothers, now deceased.\n | \n\u20185) | During the cadastral survey of the property on October 15, 1979 there was already a dispute between Honorata M. Bolante and Miguel Mendoza, brother of [petitioners].\n | \n6) | \u2018[Respondent was] occupying the property in question.\n[END_TABLE]\n\n\u20181) The land subject of the case was formerly declared for taxation purposes in the name of Sinforoso Mendoza prior to 1954 but is now declared in the name of Margarito Mendoza. 2) \u2018The parties agree[d] as to the identity of the land subject of instant case. \u20183) [Petitioners] are the daughters of Margarito Mendoza while the [respondent] is the only daughter of Sinforoso Mendoza. '4) Margarito Mendoza and Sinforoso Mendoza [were] brothers, now deceased. \u20185) During the cadastral survey of the property on October 15, 1979 there was already a dispute between Honorata M. Bolante and Miguel Mendoza, brother of [petitioners]. 6) \u2018[Respondent was] occupying the property in question.\n\u2018The only issue involved [was] who [was] the lawful owner and possessor of the land subject of the case.\u2019\n\"After trial, the court a quo rendered its judgment in favor of [petitioners], the dispositive portion of which reads as follows:\n\u2018Wherefore, in view of the foregoing considerations, judgment is hereby rendered for the [petitioners] and against the [respondent]:\n\n[TABLE_CONTENT]\n\u20181. | Declaring that the parcel of land situated in Bangad, Binangonan, Rizal covered by tax declaration no. 26-0027 in the name of Margarito Mendoza belong to his heirs, the [petitioners] herein;\n | \n\u20182. | Ordering [respondent] to vacate the property subject of the case and deliver possession thereof to the heirs of Margarito Mendoza.\n | \n\u20183. | Ordering the [respondent] to indemnify the [petitioners] in the sum of P10,000.00, as actual damages.\n | \n\u20184. | Ordering the [respondent] to pay the costs.\u2019\"\n[END_TABLE]\n\n\u20181.

Ordering [respondent] to vacate the property subject of the case and deliver possession thereof to the heirs of Margarito Mendoza. \u20183. Ordering the [respondent] to indemnify the [petitioners] in the sum of P10,000.00, as actual damages. \u20184. Ordering the [respondent] to pay the costs.\u2019\"\nRuling of the Court of Appeals\n\nThe Court of Appeals reversed the trial court because the genuineness and the due execution of the affidavit allegedly signed by the respondent and her mother had not been sufficiently established. The notary public or anyone else who had witnessed the execution of the affidavit was not presented. No expert testimony or competent witness ever attested to the genuineness of the questioned signatures.\n\nThe CA further ruled that the affidavit was insufficient to overcome the denial of respondent and her mother. The former testified that the latter, never having attended school, could neither read nor write. Respondent also said that she had never been called \"Leonor,\" which was how she was referred to in the affidavit.\n\nMoreover, the appellate court held that the probative value of petitioners\u2019 tax receipts and declarations paled in comparison with respondent\u2019s proof of ownership of the disputed parcel. Actual, physical, exclusive and continuous possession by respondent since 1985 indeed gave her a better title under Article 538 of the Civil Code.\n\nHence, this Petition. [5]\n\nIssues\n\nInsisting that they are the rightful owners of the disputed land, the petitioners allege that the CA committed these reversible errors: [6]\n\"1. xxx [I]n not considering the affidavit as an exception to the general rule that an affidavit is classified as hearsay evidence, unless the affiant is placed on the witness stand; and\n\n\"2. xxx [I]n holding that respondent has been in actual and physical possession, coupled with xxx exclusive and continuous possession of the land since 1985, which are evidence of the best kind of circumstance proving the claim of the title of ownership and enjoys the presumption of preferred possessor.\"\nThe Court's Ruling\n\nThe Petition has no merit.\n\nFirst Issue:\nAdmissibility of the Affidavit\n\nPetitioners dispute the CA's ruling that the affidavit was not the best evidence of their father's ownership of the disputed land, because the \"affiant was not placed on the witness stand.\" They contend that it was unnecessary to present a witness to establish the authenticity of the affidavit because it was a declaration against respondent's interest and was an ancient document. As a declaration against interest, it was an exception to the hearsay rule. As a necessary and trustworthy document, it was admissible in evidence. And because it was executed on March 24, 1953, it was a self-authenticating ancient document.\n\nWe quote below the pertinent portion of the appellate court's ruling: [7]\n\"While it is true that the affidavit was signed and subscribed before a notary public, the general rule is that affidavits are classified as hearsay evidence, unless affiants are placed on the witness stand ( People's Bank and Trust Company vs. Leonidas , 207 SCRA 164). Affidavits are not considered the best evidence, if affiants are available as witnesses ( Vallarta vs. Court of Appeals , 163 SCRA 587). The due execution of the affidavit was not sufficiently established. The notary public or others who saw that the document was signed or at least [could] confirm its recitals [were] not presented. There was no expert testimony or competent witness who attested to the genuineness of the questioned signatures. Worse, [respondent] denied the genuineness of her signature and that of her mother xxx. [Respondent] testified that her mother was an illiterate and as far as she knew her mother could not write because she had not attended school (p. 7, ibid ). Her testimony was corroborated by Ma. Sales Bolante Basa, who said the [respondent's] mother was illiterate.\"\nThe petitioners\u2019 allegations are untenable. Before a private document offered as authentic can be received in evidence, its due execution and authenticity must be proved first. [8] And before a document is admitted as an exception to the hearsay rule under the Dead Man's Statute, the offeror must show (a) that the declarant is dead, insane or unable to testify; (b) that the declaration concerns a fact cognizable by the declarant; (c) that at the time the declaration was made, he was aware that the same was contrary to his interest; and (d) that circumstances render improbable the existence of any motive to falsify. [9]\n\nIn this case, one of the affiants happens to be the respondent, who is still alive and who testified that the signature in the affidavit was not hers. A declaration against interest is not admissible if the declarant is available to testify as a witness. [10] Such declarant should be confronted with the statement against interest as a prior inconsistent statement.\n\nThe affidavit cannot be considered an ancient document either. An ancient document is one that is (1) more than 30 years old, (2) found in the proper custody, and (3) unblemished by any alteration or by any circumstance of suspicion. [11] It must on its face appear to be genuine. The petitioners herein failed, however, to explain how the purported signature of Eduarda Apiado could have been affixed to the subject affidavit if, according to the witness, she was an illiterate woman who never had any formal schooling. This circumstance casts suspicion on its authenticity.\n\nNot all notarized documents are exempted from the rule on authentication. Thus, an affidavit does not automatically become a public document just because it contains a notarial jurat. Furthermore, the affidavit in question does not state how the ownership of the subject land was transferred from Sinforoso Mendoza to Margarito Mendoza. By itself, an affidavit is not a mode of acquiring ownership.\n\nSecond Issue:\nPreference of Possession\n\nThe CA ruled that the respondent was the preferred possessor under Article 538 of the Civil Code because she was in notorious, actual, exclusive and continuous possession of the land since 1985. Petitioners dispute this ruling. They contend that she came into possession through force and violence, contrary to Article 536 of the Civil Code.\n\nWe concede that despite their dispossession in 1985, the petitioners did not lose legal possession because possession cannot be acquired through force or violence. [12] To all intents and purposes, a possessor, even if physically ousted, is still deemed the legal possessor. [13] Indeed, anyone who can prove prior possession, regardless of its character, may recover such possession. [14]\n\nHowever, possession by the petitioners does not prevail over that of the respondent. Possession by the former before 1985 was not exclusive, as the latter also acquired it before 1985. The records show that the petitioners\u2019 father and brother, as well as the respondent and her mother were simultaneously in adverse possession of the land.\n\nBefore 1985, the subject land was occupied and cultivated by the respondent's father (Sinforoso), who was the brother of petitioners' father (Margarito), as evidenced by Tax Declaration No. 26425. [15] When Sinforoso died in 1930, Margarito took possession of the land and cultivated it with his son Miguel. At the same time, respondent and her mother continued residing on the lot.\n\nWhen respondent came of age in 1948, she paid realty taxes for the years 1932-1948. [16] Margarito declared the lot for taxation in his name in 1953 [17] and paid its realty taxes beginning 1952. [18] When he died, Miguel continued cultivating the land. As found by the CA, the respondent and her mother were living on the land, which was being tilled by Miguel until 1985 when he was physically ousted by the respondent. [19]\n\nBased on Article 538 of the Civil Code, the respondent is the preferred possessor because, benefiting from her father's tax declaration of the subject lot since 1926, she has been in possession thereof for a longer period. On the other hand, petitioners' father acquired joint possession only in 1952.\n\nThird Issue:\nPossession of Better Right\n\nFinally, the petitioners challenge the CA ruling that \"actual and physical coupled with the exclusive and continuous possession [by respondent] of the land since 1985\" proved her ownership of the disputed land. The respondent argues that she was legally presumed to possess the subject land with a just title since she possessed it in the concept of owner. Under Article 541 of the Code, she could not be obliged to show or prove such title.\n\nThe respondent's contention is untenable. The presumption in Article 541 of the Civil Code is merely disputable; it prevails until the contrary is proven. [20] That is, one who is disturbed in one's possession shall, under this provision, be restored thereto by the means established by law. [21] Article 538 settles only the question of possession, and possession is different from ownership. Ownership in this case should be established in one of the ways provided by law.\n\nTo settle the issue of ownership, we need to determine who between the claimants has proven acquisitive prescription. [22]\n\nOwnership of immovable property is acquired by ordinary prescription through possession for ten years. [23] Being the sole heir of her father, respondent showed through his tax receipt that she had been in possession of the land for more than ten years since 1932. When her father died in 1930, she continued to reside there with her mother. When she got married, she and her husband engaged in kaingin inside the disputed lot for their livelihood. [24]\n\nRespondent's possession was not disturbed until 1953 when the petitioners' father claimed the land. But by then, her possession, which was in the concept of owner -- public, peaceful, and uninterrupted [25] -- had already ripened into ownership. Furthermore she herself, after her father's demise, declared and paid realty taxes for the disputed land. Tax receipts and declarations of ownership for taxation, when coupled with proof of actual possession of the property, can be the basis of a claim for ownership through prescription. [26]\n\nIn contrast, the petitioners, despite thirty-two years of farming the subject land, did not acquire ownership. It is settled that ownership cannot be acquired by mere occupation. [27] Unless coupled with the element of hostility toward the true owner, [28] occupation and use, however long, will not confer title by prescription or adverse possession. Moreover, the petitioners cannot claim that their possession was public, peaceful and uninterrupted. Although their father and brother arguably acquired ownership through extraordinary prescription because of their adverse possession for thirty-two years (1953-1985), [29] this supposed ownership cannot extend to the entire disputed lot, but must be limited to the portion that they actually farmed.\n\nWe cannot sustain the petitioners' contention that their ownership of the disputed land was established before the trial court through the series of tax declarations and receipts issued in the name of Margarito Mendoza. Such documents prove that the holder has a claim of title over the property. Aside from manifesting a sincere desire to obtain title thereto, they announce the holder's adverse claim against the state and other interested parties. [30]\n\nHowever, tax declarations and receipts are not conclusive evidence of ownership. [31] At most, they constitute mere prima facie proof of ownership or possession of the property for which taxes have been paid. [32] In the absence of actual public and adverse possession, the declaration of the land for tax purposes does not prove ownership. [33] In sum, the petitioners' claim of ownership of the whole parcel has no legal basis.\n\nWHEREFORE, the Petition is DENIED and the assailed Decision and Resolution AFFIRMED .

CLERK OF COURT ROMAN GATBALITE AND SHERIFF ARCHIMEDES ALMEIDA, BOTH OF THE MTC-NAVOTAS, BRANCH 54, RESPONDENTS.\n\nD E C I S I O N\n\nGONZAGA-REYES, J.:\n\nPablo Casaje is the plaintiff in Civil Cases Nos. 3407 and 3408 both for Unlawful Detainer filed before the Metropolitan Trial Court of Navotas, Branch 54 wherein judgments [1] therein were rendered in his favor. On October 1, 1996, an Order [2] was issued by the court a quo granting plaintiff\u2019s motion for execution as the decisions in the aforesaid cases have become final and executory.\n\nCasaje claims that writs of execution were accordingly issued and on October 11, 1996, he paid the necessary amounts for the service of the writs of execution as evidenced by O.R. Nos. 5966365 and 5967228. [3] Claiming that the herein respondents Branch Clerk of Court Roman Gatbalite and Deputy sheriff Archimedes Almeida never acted on these writs of execution, Casaje filed a letter-complaint dated December 5, 1997 [4] for gross inefficiency and neglect of duty against them alleging, inter alia , that Deputy Sheriff Almeida furnished herein complainant Casaje with a list of expenses for the enforcement of writs for the approval of the court in the amount of P5,010.00 allegedly in compliance with Administrative Circular No. 31-90 which included the amount of P2,000.00 for meals and incidental expenses; that more than one (1) year after Casaje paid the fees for the enforcement of the writs in the two (2) civil cases but Almeida has not done anything or taken any step to implement them; and that Gatbalite, as immediate supervisor of Almeida, did nothing despite knowledge of the latter\u2019s inaction.\n\nIn his Comment, [5] Branch Clerk of Court Gatbalite denies the charges claiming that he had no knowledge whatsoever of the activities or whatever agreement Casaje had with respondent Almeida nor has Casaje ever reported to him the actuations of respondent Almeida. He further alleges that contrary to Casaje\u2019s allegation, the Deputy Sheriff is under the direct control and supervision of the judge.\n\nRespondent Deputy Sheriff Almeida filed his Comment [6] alleging that he is not in possession of the aforementioned writs of execution; that Casaje merely inquired from him as to the expenses to be incurred in the enforcement of the writs and he submitted his estimate of expenses to the court subject to its approval pursuant to Rule 141 but this was not acted upon by the court up to the time the office of the MTC-Navotas, Branch 54 was gutted by fire on June 6, 1998.\n\nIn a letter dated October 8, 1998 [7] addressed to Judge Reynold Yaneza of the MTC-Navotas, Branch 54, Casaje further claims that aside from the amount of P5,010.00, Almeida likewise asked for P15,000.00 allegedly to be divided between him and Gatbalite.\n\nIn the Resolution dated March 17, 1999, [8] the case was referred to Judge Benjamin Aquino, Jr. of the Regional Trial Court of Malabon, Branch 72 for investigation, report and recommendation and the case was set for hearing.\n\nIn his Report, [9] Investigating Judge Aquino found that respondent Deputy Sheriff Almeida indeed asked for the amount of P5,010.00 for the enforcement of the writs of execution but the amount was not yet final as it was still subject to the approval by the trial court. The alleged demand for the amount of P15,000.00 was not substantiated. For his failure to secure the approval of the court within a reasonable time, however, the investigating judge recommended that Deputy Sheriff Almeida be reprimanded for not acting with dispatch in the execution of the writs.\n\nWith respect to respondent Branch Clerk of Court Gatbalite, the investigating judge is of the opinion that Gatbalite should be absolved of the charges as he had no participation in the issuance of the writs. Although clerks of court exercise administrative supervision over all court personnel, the deputy sheriff is under the direct control and supervision of the presiding judge. The writs were signed by the presiding judge and respondent clerk of court did not participate in the issuance thereof. Hence, it is recommended that the complaint against respondent Clerk of Court Gatbalite be dismissed for lack of merit.\n\nIn the Resolution dated November 17, 1999, [10] the case was referred to the Court Administrator for evaluation, report and recommendation. The Court Administrator saw no reason to disregard the findings of the investigating judge but disagreed with the recommendation that respondent Deputy Sheriff Almeida be merely reprimanded for his failure to execute the writs. He opined that the failure to abide by the pronouncements of the court deserves a higher penalty. Hence, it is recommended that respondent Deputy Sheriff Almeida be fined in the amount of P3,000.00 but the complaint against respondent Branch Clerk of Court Gatbalite be dismissed for lack of merit.\n\nThe Order for the issuance of a writ of execution was issued by the trial court on October 1, 1996 [11] and the respondent Deputy Sheriff Almeida submitted a list of expenses for the consideration and approval of the court. [12] He claims, however, that he could not enforce the judgments in Civil Cases Nos. 3407 and 3408 because he was \"not in receipt or in possession of any of the alleged writ of execution\". [13] In his testimony, respondent Deputy Sheriff Almeida admitted having seen the writ of execution attached to the records but did not formally serve the copy thereof because he was \"waiting (for) the list of expenses to be approved by the Judge\". [14] Branch Clerk of Court Gatbalite likewise does not deny that the writ of execution was issued by the judge of the MTC-Navotas, Branch 54. [15]\n\nThe function of ordering the execution of a judgment, being judicial, devolves upon the judge whereas the act of issuing the writ of execution, being ministerial, can be performed by another person, viz., the clerk of court. As the rule now stands, the clerk of court may, under the direction of the court or judge, make out and sign all writs and processes issuing from the court. [16] In this case, however, there is no question that the subject writs of execution were signed by the presiding judge and not by the clerk of court.\n\nWe agree with the recommendation of the Investigating Judge and the Court Administrator that respondent Branch Clerk of Court Gatbalite should be absolved from the charges as he had no participation in the issuance of the writs of execution. Likewise, the charge that Deputy Sheriff Almeida demanded from complainant the amount of P15,000.00 was not substantiated and the same should be dismissed. However, we adopt the recommendation of the Court Administrator to impose a fine on Deputy Sheriff Almeida in the amount of P3,000.00. We believe that respondent Deputy Sheriff Almeida was remiss on his duties.\n\nWhen a writ is placed in the hands of a sheriff, it is his duty, in the absence of instructions, to proceed with reasonable celerity and promptness to execute it in accordance with its mandates. [17] The officers charged with the delicate task of enforcing the judgment must act with dispatch so as not to unduly delay the administration of justice. And as stated in the case of Portes vs. Tepace : [18]\n\n\"Indeed, the importance of the role played by sheriffs and deputy sheriffs in the administration of justice cannot be over-emphasized. They are the court personnel primarily responsible for the speedy and efficient service of all court processes and writs originating from courts. Most importantly, they are officers of the court upon whom the execution of a final judgment depends and it is a truism that execution is the fruit and end of the suit and is the life of the law. Hence, sheriffs must at all times show a high degree of professionalism in the performance of their duties. A decision left unexecuted or delayed indefinitely due to the inefficiency, negligence, misconduct or ignorance of the law of sheriffs renders the same inutile. What is worse, the parties who are prejudiced tend to condemn the entire judicial system.\"\n\nMoreover, respondent Deputy Sheriff Almeida cannot avoid responsibility by claiming that the court a quo has not yet approved his estimate of expenses and hence the writ of execution could not be implemented. Under Section 9, Rule 141 of the Rules of Court, respondent Deputy Sheriff Almeida was obliged to secure the approval of the issuing court of the estimated expenses and fees for implementation of the writ of execution. He was duty-bound to collect from the winning party the expenses and fees for the demolition. [19] As aptly observed by Investigating Judge Aquino, the writ of execution was prepared sometime in the latter part of 1996 while the office of the Navotas court and all the records therein were gutted by fire only on June 6, 1998; hence, the writs should have been implemented even way before the records were destroyed by fire. [20] Clearly, respondent Deputy Sheriff Almeida failed to act with dispatch and promptness in the implementation of the writ.\n\nWHEREFORE , in view of the foregoing, respondent Deputy Sheriff Archimedes D. Almeida is hereby FINED in the amount of Three Thousand (P3,000.00) Pesos with warning that a repetition of the same or similar act shall be dealt with more severely by this Court. The complaint against respondent Clerk of court Roman Gatbalite is DISMISSED for lack of merit.\n\nSO ORDERED.\n\nMelo, (Chairman), Vitug, and Panganiban, JJ., concur.\n\nPurisima, J., abroad-no part.\n\n[1] Rendered on September 30, 1994 and September 19, 1997, respectively, p. 1, Rollo .\n\n[2] p. 17, ibid.\n\n[3] p. 2, of the complaint, p. 2, ibid.\n\n[4] pp. 1-3, ibid.\n\n[5] p. 11, ibid.\n\n[6] p. 20, ibid.\n\n[7] pp. 23-24, ibid.\n\n[8] p. 34, ibid.\n\n[9] pp.79-85, ibid.\n\n[10] p. 130, ibid.\n\n[11] Annex \"A\", p. 17, Rollo.\n\n[12] Annex \"D\", p. 18, ibid.\n\n[13] p. 20, ibid.\n\n[14] pp. 8-9, TSN, August 18, 1999, pp. 62-63, ibid.\n\n[15] p. 10, TSN, ibid.\n\n[16] Viray vs. CA , 286 SCRA 468.\n\n[17] Jumio vs. Egay-Eviota , 231 SCRA 551.\n\n[18] 267 SCRA 185 at p. 194.\n\n[19] Vda.

BELGA, COMPLAINANT, VS. JUDGE MAMERTO M. BUBAN, RESPONDENT.\n\nD E C I S I O N\n\nGONZAGA-REYES, J.:\n\nNestor B. Belga, then Chief of Police of Tabaco, Albay, filed an Information for Illegal Possession of Firearms against one Noel Bodota de Rama which was docketed as Criminal Case No. T-2497 and raffled to respondent Judge Mamerto M. Buban of the Regional Trial Court of Tabaco, Albay, Branch 18. Upon arraignment, accused pleaded not guilty.\n\nThe findings of fact by the trial court may be summarized as follows: On August 18, 1993, accused Noel Bodota de Rama was driving at a fast speed so that he almost sideswiped one of the policemen standing at the side of the road. The policemen, using the police car, chased the accused until they finally caught him at the intersection of the road. One of the policemen went near the accused and got his gun. A scuffle ensued for about 5 minutes. Finally, accused gave his gun, a .38 caliber, to the police. He was invited to the police station and was found to be positive for alcohol. He was likewise requested to produce any document to prove his authority to carry firearm. He presented a Mission Order No. 020, series of 1993 from the NBI which stated \"Proceed to National Capital Region or Bicol.\" He had no permit to carry a firearm.\n\nOn October 29, 1995, respondent Judge Buban rendered a decision acquitting the accused for failure of the prosecution to prove his guilt beyond reasonable doubt.\n\nThe present administrative case, originally docketed as A.M. OCA IPI NO. 97-355-RTJ, was filed by complainant Nestor Belga charging respondent Judge Mamerto M. Buban of gross ignorance of the law and violation of Section 3 (e) of Republic Act No. 3019 (anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act) in rendering the judgment of acquittal.\n\nComplainant avers that in acquitting the accused, respondent judge \"caused undue injury to the government and gave the accused Noel Bodota de Ramas an unwarranted benefit(s), advantage or preference in the discharge of his judicial functions through manifest partiality and gross inexcusable negligence\". He makes reference to the reasoning of respondent judge in acquitting the accused; the pertinent portion of the decision is quoted hereunder, to wit:\n\n\"Section 1, subparagraph 5 of P.D. 1866, states that the penalty of prision mayor shall be imposed upon any person who shall carry any licensed firearm outside his residence without legal authority therefor. It is, therefore, necessary to prove the existence of any authority to carry a firearm. The accused was caught carrying a firearm inside his jeep because of his manner of driving. Had the accused been careful in his driving, his carrying of the gun could not have been enforced. The fact is, he had a gun in his jeep, a violation of the said section of P.D. 1866. His carrying of the gun is because of a mission order No. 020 S\u201993 duly issued to him by the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI), Legazpi City. Although, a certain Atty. Mamaril of the NBI, Manila testified that no such agent by the name of Noel de Ramas was ever registered in their office in Manila, however, Atty. Carillo of the NBI, Legazpi City testified that the Chief of office in any sub-office or regional offices, the Director himself, or the agent in charge are authorized to sign a mission order.\n\nThe Court is, therefore, mindful of the mission order issued. The accused could not produce such mission order by himself. The carrying of the gun was because of that mission order.\"\n\nIn his Comment, respondent Judge Buban alleges that no law was ignored in rendering the judgment of acquittal. He claims that the charge of \"gross ignorance of the law\" stemmed from the finding in the decision \"that the accused had a mission order\"; that while it is true that Atty. Rogelio Mamaril, head of the office of the NBI, Legazpi Agency, testified that the NBI Regional Director has no authority to issue a Mission Order to a civilian since that authority is vested only on the NBI National Director, respondent stated that he had to consider the testimony of Atty. Carlos Carillo, NBI Supervising Agent of Legazpi Agency to the effect that the Chief of Office in any sub-office or regional officer is authorized to sign a mission order; and that there being conflicting claims of two (2) lawyers from the NBI, the doubt had to be resolved in favor of the accused.\n\nIn compliance with the Court\u2019s Resolution dated November 15, 1999, the parties herein manifested that they are submitting the case for decision/resolution on the basis of the pleadings/records already filed and submitted.\n\nThe Court Administrator submitted his recommendation finding respondent judge guilty of ignorance of the law and negligence in the performance of his duties in rendering an \"erroneous\" decision in Criminal Case No. T-2497. The Court Administrator found that, while there may be no corruption involved in rendering the judgment of acquittal, the respondent judge was negligent in his study of the facts of the case and of the law and that upon a careful reading of the decision of respondent judge, no law or jurisprudence has been applied in arriving at the judge\u2019s conclusion. He is of the opinion that the respondent judge did not exert his utmost effort to study the law and jurisprudence on the matter as he merely relied on the existence of the mission order in acquitting the accused in the criminal case. The Court Administrator recommends that respondent judge be meted the penalty of fine in the amount of P10,000.00 with warning that a repetition of the same offense will be dealt with more severely.\n\nAt the outset, it should be emphasized that this Court, acting as an administrative tribunal, cannot review the trial court\u2019s decision. The main concern of this Court in the present administrative proceedings is to determine whether the respondent judge, in rendering the judgment of acquittal, was guilty of gross ignorance of the law.\n\nFrom the facts, there is no question that accused Noel Bodota de Ramas is a civilian; his name does not appear in the records as an agent of the NBI. The firearm, a .38 caliber revolver, is a personal firearm as it was not issued by the NBI. At the time of his apprehension, accused admitted that he had no license nor Permit to Carry Firearm Outside of Residence as the same had already expired. He had in his possession a mission order issued by the NBI stating: \"Proceed to National Capital Region or Bicol\" but he did not make any report thereon. As can be gleaned from the decision of the respondent judge, the acquittal of the accused was based primarily on the fact that the accused was in possession of a mission order. It is clear from P.D. 1866 that a license is necessary in order to possess a firearm. As held in the case of Pastrano vs. Court of Appeals , [1] a mission order cannot take the place of a license. Verily, respondent judge committed an erroneous conclusion in acquitting the accused in the criminal case.\n\nOrdinarily, judges may not be administratively sanctioned for mere errors of judgment, absent any bad faith or malice. Nonetheless, they have an obligation to keep abreast of all basic laws and principles. There is no excuse for ignorance of elementary notions and jurisprudence. [2] A judge is called upon to exhibit more than just a cursory acquaintance with statutes and procedural rules; it is imperative that he be conversant with basic legal principles and be aware of well-settled authoritative doctrines. He should strive for excellence, exceeded only by his passion for truth, to the end that he be the personification of justice and the Rule of Law. [3] We reiterate the pressing responsibility of judges to keep abreast with the law and changes therein, as well as with latest decisions of the Supreme Court. The role of justices and judges in the administration of justice requires a continuous study of the law and jurisprudence lest public confidence in the judiciary would be eroded by the incompetent and irresponsible conduct of judges [4] . This is consistent with the standard that magistrates must be the embodiment of competence, integrity and independence.\n\nWe cannot countenance the failure of respondent judge to inform himself of recent jurisprudence. While we recognize his error to be an honest one, such error should never happen again. Admittedly, judges cannot be held to account for erroneous judgments rendered in good faith but this defense has been all too frequently cited to the point of staleness. [5] However, the penalty recommended by the Court Administrator is too harsh and the same should be reduced.\n\nWHEREFORE , for ignorance of the law, respondent Judge Mamerto M. Buban is hereby FINED in the amount of Five Thousand Pesos (P5,000.00), with a warning that a repetition of the same or similar acts in the future shall be dealt with more severely by this Court.\n\nSO ORDERED.\n\nMelo, (Chairman), Vitug, and Panganiban, JJ., concur.\n\nPurisima, J., abroad \u2014 took no part.\n\n[1] 281 SCRA 287.\n\n[2] Gil Ramon O.

ATIENZA, RESPONDENTS.D E C I S I O N KAPUNAN, J.: In this petition for certiorari petitioners seek to annul and set aside the Resolution dated June 4, 1998 of the Commission on Elections (COMELEC) First Division directing the proclamation of private respondent as Mayor of the City of Manila for having been issued with grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack, or excess, of jurisdiction.The backdrop of the instant case reveals the following antecedent facts:Petitioners Amado S. Bagatsing, Ernesto M. Maceda and Jaime Lopez and herein private respondent Jose L. Atienza were candidates for the position of Mayor of Manila in the May 11, 1998 elections.On May 18, 1998, seven (7) days after the elections, petitioners filed with the COMELEC a complaint for disqualification against private respondent, docketed as SPA No. 98-319, on the ground that the latter allegedly caused the disbursement of public funds in the amount of Three Million Three Hundred Seventy-Five Thousand (P3,375,000.00) Pesos, more or less, within the prohibited forty-five-day period before the elections in violation of Article 22, Section 261 (g) (2).[1] of Batas Pambansa Blg. 881, otherwise known as the Omnibus Election Code of the Philippines. The alleged disbursement was intended to be distributed in the form of financial assistance to the public school teachers of the City of Manila who manned the precinct polls in that city during the elections.On May 20, 1998, the COMELEC (First Division)* issued an order which dispositively reads as follows:PREMISES CONSIDERED, it appearing that the evidence presented consisting of disbursement voucher and the general payroll evidencing payment to the teachers in the form of financial assistance dated May 5, 1998, in violation of Section 68 of the Omnibus Election Code, which provides:SEC. 68. Disqualifications. \u2013 Any candidate who in an action or protest in which he is a party is declared by final decision of a competent court guilty of, or found by the Commission of having (a) given money or other material consideration to influence, induce or corrupt the voters or public officials performing electoral functions; (b) committed acts of terrorism to enhance his candidacy, (c) spent in his election campaign an amount in excess of that allowed by this Code; (d) solicited, received or made any contribution prohibited under Section 89, 95, 96, 97 and 104; or (e) violated any Section 80, 83, 85, 86 and 261, paragraphs d, e, k, v and cc, sub-paragraph 6, shall be disqualified from continuing as a candidate, or if he has been elected, from holding the office. Any person who is a permanent resident of or an immigrant to a foreign country shall not be qualified to run for any elective office under this Code, unless said person has waived hi (sic) statues (sic) as permanent resident or immigrant of a foreign country in accordance with the residence requirement provided for in the election laws (Sec. 25, 1971 EC) (underscoring ours).show a probable cause of commission of election offenses which are grounds for disqualification, and the evidence in support of disqualification is strong, the City Board of Canvassers of Manila is hereby directed to complete the canvassing of election returns of the City of Manila, but to suspend proclamation of respondent Jose L. Atienza, Jr. should he obtain the winning number of votes for the position of City Mayor of Manila, until such time when the petition for disqualification against him shall have been resolved.The Executive Director of this Commission is directed to cause the immediate implementation of this Order.SO ORDERED.[2]On May 21, 1998, private respondent filed a Motion for Reconsideration and sought to set aside the afore-quoted order directing his proclamation as mayor.On June 4, 1998, the COMELEC (First Division)* rendered a resolution ratiocinating thusly:The Commission En Banc finds correct respondent\u2019s reliance on COMELEC Resolution No. 2050 for his cause. The Resolution, promulgated by the Commission in order to formulate the rules governing the disposition of cases of disqualification filed by virtue of Section 68 of the Omnibus Election Code in relation to Section 6 of Republic Act 6646 otherwise known as the Electoral Reform Law of 1987, pertinently provides:2. Any complaint for disqualification based on Section 68 of the Omnibus Election Code, filed after the elections against a candidate who has alredy been proclaimed as winner shall be dismissed as a disqualification case. However, the complaint shall be referred for preliminary investigation to the Law Department of the Commission.Where a similar complaint is filed after the elections but before proclamation of the respondent candidate, the complaint shall nevertheless, be dismissed as a disqualification case. However, the complaint shall be referred for preliminary investigation to the Law Deparment. If, before proclamation, the Law Department makes a prima facie finding of guilt and the corresponding information has been filed with the appropriate trial court, the complainant may file a petition for suspension of the proclamation of the respondent with the Court before which the criminal case is pending and the said Court may order the suspension of the proclamation, if the evidence of guilt is strong.The applicability of COMELEC Resolution No. 2050 on cases of such nature as the one at bench, had been upheld by the Supreme Court in Lozano vs. Commission on Elections, G.R. 94628, October 28, 1991, when it declared:Resolution No. 2050 specifically mandates a definite policy and procedure for disqualification cases. The COMELEC Rules of Procedure speak of special actions, which include disqualification cases, in general. Hence, as between as specific and a general rule, the former shall necessarily prevail.It is thus, a good law which could govern this case.Considering therefore, that the petition for disqualification was filed after the election but before respondent\u2019s proclamation, the Commission En Banc, conformably with Resolution No. 2050, hereby dismisses the same as a disqualification case but refers Petitioners\u2019 charges of election offense against respondent to the Law Department for appropriate action.[3]The decretal portion of the resolution reads:WHEREFORE, in view of the foregoing, the Commission FIRST DIVISION hereby GRANTS the Motion to lift the order of suspension of respondent\u2019s proclamation. The Order of the First Division suspending respondent\u2019s proclamation as City Mayor of Manila is SET ASIDE. The City Board of Canvassers of Manila is hereby DIRECTED to CONVENE, COMPLETE the CANVASS and PROCLAIM the candidate obtaining the highest number of votes for said position. Petitioners\u2019 complaints against respondent for violation of the Omnibus Election Code is hereby referred to the Law Department for preliminary investigation.SO ORDERED.[4]That same day at around eleven in the morning, petitioners filed a Motion to Suspend Immediate Intended Proclamation of Respondent. In the afternoon of the same day, petitioners likewise filed a Motion for Reconsideration and a Second Motion to Suspend Immediate Intended Proclamation of Respondent before COMELEC en banc.Meanwhile, the City Board of Canvassers of Manila reconvened at three o\u2019clock in the afternoon of the same day, June 4, 1998, and proclaimed private respondent as the duly elected Mayor of the City of Manila.[5]On June 25, 1999, without waiting for the resolution of their motion for reconsideration pending before the COMELEC en banc, petitioners filed the instant petition to set aside the June 4, 1998 Resolution of the COMELEC\u2019s First Division.Records reveal, however, that said motion for reconsideration was denied for reconsideration pending before the COMELEC en banc was denied in its Order of July 2, 1998 at the instance of herein petitioners themselves for the reason that they had already filed a petition before this Court docketed as G.R. No. 134047.[6] The ground for the petitition at bar, as therein promulgated, is as follows:6.1 Respondent acted whimsically, capriciously and arbitrarily when it dismissed outright the Petition for Disqualification docketed SPA No. 98-319 against respondent Atienza on the basis of Comelec Resolution 2050 which had already been modified by this Honorable Court in the case of Sunga vs. Comelec (supra). Therefore the dismissal by the Comelec must be struck down as having been issued in excess of jurisdiction or with grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack of jurisdiction.[7]The only issue for our consideration is whether or not the COMELEC First Division committed grave abuse of discretion in issuing the Resolution dated June 4, 1998 dismissing the disqualification case against private respondent and referring the same to its Law Department for preliminary investigation.COMELEC Resolution No. 2050, adopted on November 3, 1988, reads:WHEREAS, there remain pending before the Commission, a number of cases of disqualification filed by virtue of the provisions of Section 68 of the Omnibus Election Code in relation to Section 6 of R.A. 6646, otherwise known as the Electoral Reforms Law of 1987;WHEREAS, opinions of the members of the Commission on matters of procedure in dealing with cases of this nature and the manner of disposing of the same have not been uniform;WHEREAS, in order to avoid conflicts of opinion in the disposition or disqualification cases contemplated under Section 68 of the Omnibus Election Code in relation to Section 6 of Rep. Act 6646, there is a strongly felt need to lay down a definite policy in the disposition of this specific class of disqualification cases;NOW, THEREFORE, on motion duly seconded, the Commission en banc:RESOLVED, as it hereby resolves, to formulate the following rules governing the disposition of cases of disqualification filed by virtue of Section 68 of the Omnibus Election Code in relation to Section 6 of R.A. No. 6646, otherwise known as the Electoral Reforms Law of 1987:1. Any complaint for the disqualification of a duly registered candidate based upon any of the grounds specifically enumerated under Section 68 of the Omnibus Election Code, filed directly with the Commission before an election in which the respondent is a candidate, shall be inquired into by the Commission for the purpose of determining whether the acts complained of have in fact been committed. Where the inquiry by the Commission results in a finding before election, that the respondent candidate did in fact commit the acts complained, the Commission shall order the disqualification of the respondent candidate from continuing as such candidate.In case such complaint was not resolved before the election, the Commission may motu propio, or an (sic) motion of any of the parties, refer the complaint to the law Department of the Commission as the instrument of the latter in the exercise of its exclusive power to conduct a preliminary investigation of all cases involving criminal infractions of the election laws. Such recourse may be availed of irrespective of whether the respondent has been elected or has lost in the election.2. Any complaint for disqualification based on Section 68 of the Omnibus Election Code in relation to Section 6 of Rep. Act No. 6646 filed after the election against a candidate who has already been proclaimed as winner shall be dismissed as a disqualification case. However, the complaint shall be referred for preliminary investigation to the Law Department of the Commission.Where a similar complaint is filed after election but before proclamation of the respondent candidate, the complaint shall, nevertheless, be dismissed as a disqualification case. However, the complaint shall be referred for preliminary investigation to the Law Department. If, before proclamation, the Law Department makes a prima facie finding of guilt and the corresponding information has been filed with the appropriate trial court, the complainant may file a petition for suspension of the proclamation of the respondent with the court before which the criminal case is pending and the said court may order the suspension of the proclamation if the evidence of guilt is strong. justice3. The Law Department shall terminate the preliminary investigation within thirty (30) days from receipt of the referral and shall submit its study, report and recommendation to the Commission en banc within five (5) days from the conclusion of the preliminary investigation. If it makes a prima facie finding of guilt, it shall submit with such study the Information for filing with the appropriate court.The above-quoted resolution covers two (2) different aspects:First, as contemplated in paragraph 1, a complaint for disqualification filed before the election must be inquired into by the COMELEC for the purpose of determining whether the acts complained of have in fact been committed. Where the inquiry results in a finding before the election, the COMELEC shall order the candidate\u2019s disqualification. In case the complaint was not resolved before the election, the COMELEC may motu propio or on motion of any of the parties, refer the said complaint to the Law Department of the COMELEC for preliminary investigation.Second, paragraph 2 refers to a complaint for disqualification filed after the election against a candidate who has not yet been proclaimed or who has already been proclaimed as a winner. In both cases, the complaint shall be dismissed as a disqualification case but shall be referred to the Law Department of the COMELEC for preliminary investigation. However, if before proclamation, the Law Department makes a prima facie finding of guilt and the corresponding information has been filed with the appropriate trial court, the complainant may file a petition for suspension of the proclamation of the respondent with the court before which the criminal case is pending and the said court may order the suspension of the proclamation of the evidence of guilt is strong.Petitioners contend that said resolution is no longer a good law since it has been nullified in toto by this Court in Sunga v. COMELEC.[8]Contrary to petitioners\u2019 contention, the Court did not nullify in toto COMELEC Resolution No. 2050 in the recent case of Sunga v. COMELEC. There, we held that:xxx We discern nothing in COMELEC Resolution No. 2050 declaring, ordering or directing the dismissal of a disqualification case filed before the election but which remained unresolved after the election. What the Resolution mandates in such a case is for the Commission to refer the complaint to its Law Department for investigation to determine whether the acts complained of have in fact been committed by the candidate sought to be disqualified. The findings of the Law Deparment then become the basis for disqualifying the erring candidate. This is totally different from the other two situations contemplated by Resolution No. 2050, i.e., a disqualification case filed after the election but before the proclamation of winners and that filed after the election and the proclamation of winners, wherein it was specifically directed by the same Resolution to be dismissed as a disqualification case.Moreover, Resolution No. 2050 as interpreted in Silvestre v. Duavit infringes on Sec. 6 of RA No. 6646, which provides:SEC. 6. Effects of Disqualification Case.--Any candidate who has been declared by final judgment to be disqualified shall not be voted for, and the votes cast for him shall not be counted. If for any reason a candidate is not declared by final judgment before an election to be disqualified and he is voted for and receives the winning number of votes in such election, the Court or Commission shall continue with the trial and hearing of the action, inquiry or protest and, upon motion of the complainant or any intervenor, may during the pendency thereof order the suspension of the proclamation of such candidate whenever the evidence of his guilt is strong (italics supplied).Clearly, the legislative intent is that the COMELEC should continue the trial and hearing of the disqualification case to its conclusion, i.e., until judgment is rendered thereon. The word \u2018shall\u2019 signifies that this requirment of the law is mandatory, operating to impose a positive duty which must be enforced. The implication is that the COMELEC is left with no discretion but to proceed with the disqualification case even after the election. Thus, in providing for the outright dismissal of the disqualification case which remains unresolved after the election, Silvestre v. Duavit in effect disallows what RA No. 6646 imperatively requires. xxx.[9]What the Court found objectionable therein was the second paragraph of paragraph 1 of Resolution No. 2050 as said provision clearly infringes on Section 6 of R.A. No. 6646 which mandates that should a disqualification case be not resolved before an election, the COMELEC shall continue with the trial and hearing of the case. It should not be referred to the Law Department as the resolution provides. The COMELEC\u2019s failure to distinguish between a complaint for disqualification filed before an election and one filed after an election resulted in the controversy. There, the COMELEC misapplied the rules pertaining to complaints filed after the election to a case clearly filed prior to the May 8, 1995 elections. As we have already mentioned above, the rules on disposition and resolution of cases filed before or after an election vary.[10] Consequently, the Sunga case cannot apply to the instant case because here, the disqualification case was filed on May 18, 1998, seven (7) days after the May 11, 1998 elections. Therefore, the provisions of paragraph 2 of Resolution No. 2050 must apply, in that, the complaint shall be dismissed as a disqualification case, but referred to the Law Department of the COMELEC for preliminary investigation. This is exactly what the COMELEC ruled in its assailed resolution of June 4, 1998, and rightly so.Petitioners likewise fault the COMELEC for not ordering the suspension of respondent\u2019s proclamation as mayor despite their timely-filed \"Motion to Suspend Immediate Intended Proclamation of Respondent\" and which motion was reiterated in a second motion.COMELEC did not err in not ordering the suspension of respondent\u2019s proclamation. The second paragraph of paragraph 2 of Resolution No. 2050 provides that where a complaint is filed after the elections but before proclamation, as in this case, the complaint must be dismissed as a disqualification case but shall be referred to the Law Department for preliminary investigation. If before the proclamation, the Law Department makes a prima facie finding of guilt and the corresponding information has been filed with the appropriate trial court, the complainant may file a petition for suspension of the proclamation of respondent with the court before which the criminal case is pending and that court may order the suspension of the proclamation if the evidence of guilt is strong.[11] It appearing that none of the foregoing circumstances obtain herein as there is no prima facie finding of guilt yet, a suspension o respondent\u2019s proclamation is not warranted. The mere pendency of a disqualification case against a candidate, and a winning candidate at that, does not justify the suspension of his proclamation after winning in the election. To hold otherwise would unduly encourage the filing of baseless and malicious petitions for disqualification if only to effect the suspension of the proclamation of the winning candidate, not only to his damage and prejudice but also to the defeat of the sovereign will of the electorate, and for the undue benefit of underserving third parties.[12]Before we end, a word of caution to herein petitioners and to future litigants and counsels predisposed to invoke this Court\u2019s jurisdiction without waiting for the resolution of whatever pending motions and motions for reconsideration they have before trial courts and tribunals exercising specialized jurisdiction: The Court will not countenance the practice of taking any shortcuts of the established rules of procedure pertaining to the hierarchy of courts and remedies of last resort. When the petitioners filed the instant petition for certiorari on June 25, 1999, they knew pretty well that the motion for reconsideration they filed to assail the June 4, 1998 resolution of the First Division of the Commission was still pending with the COMELEC en banc. Notwithstanding that knowledge, they went to this Court to seek another remedy which was not exactly available to them at that time. This practice falls short of forum-shopping in the technical sense and will not be allowed.WHEREFORE, the instant petition is hereby DISMISSED.SO ORDERED.Davide, Jr., C.J., Bellosillo, Melo, Puno, Vitug, Mendoza, Panganiban, Quisumbing, Purisima, Buena, Gonzaga-Reyes, Ynares-Santiago, and De Leon, Jr., JJ. concur.Pardo, J., took no part.[1] [Sec. 261.

Where the inquiry by the Commission results in a finding before election, that the respondent candidate did in fact commit the acts complained, the Commission shall order the disqualification of the respondent candidate from continuing as such candidate.\n\nIn case such complaint was not resolved before the election, the Commission may motu propio , or an (sic) motion of any of the parties, refer the complaint to the law Department of the Commission as the instrument of the latter in the exercise of its exclusive power to conduct a preliminary investigation of all cases involving criminal infractions of the election laws. Such recourse may be availed of irrespective of whether the respondent has been elected or has lost in the election.\n\n2. Any complaint for disqualification based on Section 68 of the Omnibus Election Code in relation to Section 6 of Rep. Act No. 6646 filed after the election against a candidate who has already been proclaimed as winner shall be dismissed as a disqualification case. However, the complaint shall be referred for preliminary investigation to the Law Department of the Commission.\n\nWhere a similar complaint is filed after election but before proclamation of the respondent candidate, the complaint shall, nevertheless, be dismissed as a disqualification case. However, the complaint shall be referred for preliminary investigation to the Law Department. If, before proclamation, the Law Department makes a prima facie finding of guilt and the corresponding information has been filed with the appropriate trial court, the complainant may file a petition for suspension of the proclamation of the respondent with the court before which the criminal case is pending and the said court may order the suspension of the proclamation if the evidence of guilt is strong. justice\n\n3. The Law Department shall terminate the preliminary investigation within thirty (30) days from receipt of the referral and shall submit its study, report and recommendation to the Commission en banc within five (5) days from the conclusion of the preliminary investigation. If it makes a prima facie finding of guilt, it shall submit with such study the Information for filing with the appropriate court.\nThe above-quoted resolution covers two (2) different aspects:\n\nFirst , as contemplated in paragraph 1, a complaint for disqualification filed before the election must be inquired into by the COMELEC for the purpose of determining whether the acts complained of have in fact been committed. Where the inquiry results in a finding before the election, the COMELEC shall order the candidate\u2019s disqualification. In case the complaint was not resolved before the election, the COMELEC may motu propio or on motion of any of the parties, refer the said complaint to the Law Department of the COMELEC for preliminary investigation.\n\nSecond , paragraph 2 refers to a complaint for disqualification filed after the election against a candidate who has not yet been proclaimed or who has already been proclaimed as a winner. In both cases, the complaint shall be dismissed as a disqualification case but shall be referred to the Law Department of the COMELEC for preliminary investigation. However, if before proclamation, the Law Department makes a prima facie finding of guilt and the corresponding information has been filed with the appropriate trial court, the complainant may file a petition for suspension of the proclamation of the respondent with the court before which the criminal case is pending and the said court may order the suspension of the proclamation of the evidence of guilt is strong.\n\nPetitioners contend that said resolution is no longer a good law since it has been nullified in toto by this Court in Sunga v. COMELEC . [8]\n\nContrary to petitioners\u2019 contention, the Court did not nullify in toto COMELEC Resolution No. 2050 in the recent case of Sunga v. COMELEC . There, we held that:\nxxx We discern nothing in COMELEC Resolution No. 2050 declaring, ordering or directing the dismissal of a disqualification case filed before the election but which remained unresolved after the election. What the Resolution mandates in such a case is for the Commission to refer the complaint to its Law Department for investigation to determine whether the acts complained of have in fact been committed by the candidate sought to be disqualified. The findings of the Law Deparment then become the basis for disqualifying the erring candidate. This is totally different from the other two situations contemplated by Resolution No. 2050, i.e. , a disqualification case filed after the election but before the proclamation of winners and that filed after the election and the proclamation of winners, wherein it was specifically directed by the same Resolution to be dismissed as a disqualification case.\n\nMoreover, Resolution No. 2050 as interpreted in Silvestre v. Duavit infringes on Sec. 6 of RA No. 6646, which provides:\n\nSEC. 6. Effects of Disqualification Case .--Any candidate who has been declared by final judgment to be disqualified shall not be voted for, and the votes cast for him shall not be counted. If for any reason a candidate is not declared by final judgment before an election to be disqualified and he is voted for and receives the winning number of votes in such election, the Court or Commission shall continue with the trial and hearing of the action, inquiry or protest and, upon motion of the complainant or any intervenor, may during the pendency thereof order the suspension of the proclamation of such candidate whenever the evidence of his guilt is strong (italics supplied).\n\nClearly, the legislative intent is that the COMELEC should continue the trial and hearing of the disqualification case to its conclusion, i.e., until judgment is rendered thereon. The word \u2018shall\u2019 signifies that this requirment of the law is mandatory, operating to impose a positive duty which must be enforced. The implication is that the COMELEC is left with no discretion but to proceed with the disqualification case even after the election. Thus, in providing for the outright dismissal of the disqualification case which remains unresolved after the election, Silvestre v. Duavit in effect disallows what RA No. 6646 imperatively requires. xxx. [9]\nWhat the Court found objectionable therein was the second paragraph of paragraph 1 of Resolution No. 2050 as said provision clearly infringes on Section 6 of R.A. No. 6646 which mandates that should a disqualification case be not resolved before an election, the COMELEC shall continue with the trial and hearing of the case. It should not be referred to the Law Department as the resolution provides. The COMELEC\u2019s failure to distinguish between a complaint for disqualification filed before an election and one filed after an election resulted in the controversy. There, the COMELEC misapplied the rules pertaining to complaints filed after the election to a case clearly filed prior to the May 8, 1995 elections. As we have already mentioned above, the rules on disposition and resolution of cases filed before or after an election vary. [10] Consequently, the Sunga case cannot apply to the instant case because here, the disqualification case was filed on May 18, 1998, seven (7) days after the May 11, 1998 elections. Therefore, the provisions of paragraph 2 of Resolution No. 2050 must apply, in that, the complaint shall be dismissed as a disqualification case, but referred to the Law Department of the COMELEC for preliminary investigation. This is exactly what the COMELEC ruled in its assailed resolution of June 4, 1998, and rightly so.\n\nPetitioners likewise fault the COMELEC for not ordering the suspension of respondent\u2019s proclamation as mayor despite their timely-filed \"Motion to Suspend Immediate Intended Proclamation of Respondent\" and which motion was reiterated in a second motion.\n\nCOMELEC did not err in not ordering the suspension of respondent\u2019s proclamation. The second paragraph of paragraph 2 of Resolution No. 2050 provides that where a complaint is filed after the elections but before proclamation, as in this case, the complaint must be dismissed as a disqualification case but shall be referred to the Law Department for preliminary investigation. If before the proclamation, the Law Department makes a prima facie finding of guilt and the corresponding information has been filed with the appropriate trial court, the complainant may file a petition for suspension of the proclamation of respondent with the court before which the criminal case is pending and that court may order the suspension of the proclamation if the evidence of guilt is strong. [11] It appearing that none of the foregoing circumstances obtain herein as there is no prima facie finding of guilt yet, a suspension o respondent\u2019s proclamation is not warranted. The mere pendency of a disqualification case against a candidate, and a winning candidate at that, does not justify the suspension of his proclamation after winning in the election. To hold otherwise would unduly encourage the filing of baseless and malicious petitions for disqualification if only to effect the suspension of the proclamation of the winning candidate, not only to his damage and prejudice but also to the defeat of the sovereign will of the electorate, and for the undue benefit of underserving third parties. [12]\n\nBefore we end, a word of caution to herein petitioners and to future litigants and counsels predisposed to invoke this Court\u2019s jurisdiction without waiting for the resolution of whatever pending motions and motions for reconsideration they have before trial courts and tribunals exercising specialized jurisdiction: The Court will not countenance the practice of taking any shortcuts of the established rules of procedure pertaining to the hierarchy of courts and remedies of last resort. When the petitioners filed the instant petition for certiorari on June 25, 1999, they knew pretty well that the motion for reconsideration they filed to assail the June 4, 1998 resolution of the First Division of the Commission was still pending with the COMELEC en banc . Notwithstanding that knowledge, they went to this Court to seek another remedy which was not exactly available to them at that time. This practice falls short of forum-shopping in the technical sense and will not be allowed.\n\nWHEREFORE, the instant petition is hereby DISMISSED .\n\nSO ORDERED.\n\nDavide, Jr., C.J., Bellosillo, Melo, Puno, Vitug, Mendoza, Panganiban, Quisumbing, Purisima, Buena, Gonzaga-Reyes, Ynares-Santiago , and De Leon, Jr., JJ . concur.\nPardo, J. , took no part.\n\n[1] [Sec. 261.

      "title": "PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, PLAINTIFF-APPELLEE, VS. WILLIE QUIBIDO, RUEL QUIBIDO, AND JOHN DOE, (ALL AT LARGE) RODOLFO MONTEMAYOR ALIAS \u201cDOLFO\u201d, ACCUSED APPELLANT. D E C I S I O N DE LEON, JR., J.: Before us on appeal is the Decision[1] of the Regional Trial Court of Calapan City, Oriental Mindoro, Branch 40, in Criminal Case No. C-3971, convicting herein appellant, Rodolfo Montemayor, and his co-accused, Ruel Quibido, of the crime of robbery with homicide.The lifeless body of Sofio Verguela was discovered inside his house in Bagong Silang, Victoria, Oriental Mindoro, lying face down on the floor in a pool of blood, in the early morning of February 16, 1993. His head was bashed with a blunt instrument fracturing the skull and exposing parts of his brain tissues. It was also discovered that one (1) blanket, one (1) radio and a wallet containing undetermined amount of money, all belonging to the victim, were missing.[2]On February 24, 1993, Luciano M. Vergara and Pedrito B. de Lara executed separate sworn statements before PO3 Herbert Tabernero of the Victoria, Oriental Mindoro police. Vergara stated in his sworn statement that he saw Willie Quibido, Jr., Ruel Quibido, a certain alias Dolfo, and another unidentified person, acting suspiciously while in the act of coming out of the house of the victim, at about the same time the killing incident happened at 9:00 o\u2019clock in the evening on February 15, 1993. On the other hand, de Lara was able to recognize from the group Willie Quibido, Jr. only.[3] Consequently, the accused Willie Quibido, Jr., Ruel Quibido, a John Doe and a Peter Doe were charged with the crime of robbery with homicide, defined and penalized under Article 294, paragraph 1 of the Revised Penal Code, in an information that reads: That on or about the 15th day of February 1993, at around 9:00 o\u2019clock in the evening, in Barangay Bagong Silang, Municipality of Victoria, Province of Oriental Mindoro, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, conspiring, confederating and mutually helping one another, taking advantage of the darkness of the night, with evident premeditation and by means of violence, did then and there wilfully, unlawfully and feloniously enter the house of SOFIO VERGUELA also known as SOFIO VERGUERA and once inside, wilfully, unlawfully and feloniously, with the use of violence, with intent to gain and against the will and consent of the owner thereof, took and carried away one (1) radio, one (1) blanket, one (1) wallet and undetermined amount of money all belonging to the latter, to the damage and prejudice of the said owner in the value of properties aforementioned; That on the occasion of said robbery and for the purpose of enabling them to take, steal and carry away the properties above-mentioned, the herein accused, in pursuance of their conspiracy and taking advantage of their superior strength, did then and there wilfully, unlawfully, feloniously and treacherously, with intent to kill and evident premeditation, attack, assault and hit on the head with a hard object the said SOFIO VERGUELA also known as SOFIO VERGUERA, thereby inflicting on the latter severe brain injury due to skull fracture resulting in his untimely death.CONTRARY TO LAW.Willie Quibido, Jr. was never apprehended and remains at large up to the present. Herein appellant Rodolfo Montemayor who was initially denominated as John Doe in the information in this case, and his co-accused, Ruel Quibido, were arrested on August 29, 1994 and September 5, 1994, respectively. Upon being arraigned on September 28, 1994, Rodolfo Montemayor, alias Dolfo, and Ruel Quibido,[4] both assisted by counsel de oficio, separately entered the plea of \u201cNot guilty\u201d.Meanwhile, Emil Berganio was arrested by the police on November 11, 1994. After having agreed to testify in favor of the prosecution, Berganio\u2019s name was not included in the information as one of the accused in this case. On the same date of his arrest, his sworn statement[5] was taken and which he subscribed and sworn to before Oriental Mindoro Chief Assistant Provincial Prosecutor Nicolas B. Senoren.The evidence of the prosecution shows that on February 15, 1993 at around 5:00 o\u2019clock in the afternoon the appellant, Rodolfo Montemayor alias Dolfo, and a certain Bokno invited Emil Berganio, a barrio mate in Barangay Antonino, Victoria, Oriental Mindoro, to join them to go out of town in search for employment. Emil went with Dolfo and Bokno upon learning that they were supposed to leave early on the following morning after they shall have allegedly collected a debt, to be used for their fare to Batangas, from a certain person in Barangay Bagong Silang, Victoria, Oriental Mindoro.[6]While walking alongside the NIA irrigation canal, the trio met Bokno\u2019s brother, Ruel Quibido, and his wife at a waiting shed. The group then boarded a passenger jeepney that took them to the neighboring Barangay Macatoc. From Barangay Macatoc, they proceeded on foot to the nearby Barangay Bagong Silang.[7]As planned earlier, Ruel, Bokno and Dolfo entered a two (2) storey house in Barangay Bagong Silang, Victoria, Oriental Mindoro at around 9:00 o\u2019clock in the evening. Emil remained outside the house presumably as look out, while Ruel\u2019s wife was left outside the fence. From a distance of about three (3) arms length, Emil saw Ruel through the light emanating from a gas lamp inside the house, demanded money from an old man, whose name Emil later learned as Sofio Verguela, while Dolfo was pointing his airgun at him. When the old man replied that he had no money, Ruel hit him on the head with the shotgun which he earlier carried inside a sack, and then Bokno stabbed him. After the old man fell on the floor, Ruel took his wallet, while the others took his radio, before they hurriedly left for Poblacion, Victoria, Oriental Mindoro.[8]After a few hours, the group rode the bus at the public market in Victoria, Oriental Mindoro en route to Calapan City. Upon reaching Calapan City, they dropped by the house of Ruel Quibido\u2019s mother for a few minutes before they boarded the boat at the pier bound for Batangas. They stayed in the house of Ruel Quibido\u2019s parents-in-law in Nasugbu, Batangas for more than one (1) month. Subsequently, they moved to Metro Manila in the house of Ruel Quibido\u2019s uncle in Quezon City where they stayed for more than two (2) months after which Emil decided to return home in Victoria, Oriental Mindoro ahead of his companions.[9] Emil disclosed to the police his knowledge involving the killing of Sofio Verguela when he was arrested on November 11, 1994, upon the advice of his father, after he was assured by the police of immunity from the instant criminal case.[10]Dr. Ruben A. Quimosing, M.D., Municipal Health Officer of Victoria, oriental, Mindoro during the time material to the instant case, conducted the post mortem examination on the body of the victim, Sofio Verguela. The autopsy report dated February 16, 1993 and signed by Dr. Ruben A. Quimosing shows the following findings: Skull, openBrain tissue, avulsed, with lacerationCause of death: Severe brain injury due to skull fracture.[11] Dr. Quimosing testified in court that the single blow sustained by the victim on the frontal left portion of his head which fractured the skull caused severe brain injury that inevitably resulted to his instantaneous death. The blow may have been inflicted with the use of any hard object while the victim and the assailant were facing each other.[12]The defense denied any liability for the crime of robbery with homicide. Apellant Rodolfo Montemayor testified that on February 15, 1993 and during the period prior thereto, he shared a house with his brother, Randy Montemayor, in Barangay Loyal, Victoria, Oriental Mondoro which is about twenty (20) kilometers of mountainous terrain from Barangay Bagong Silang of the same town. From Barangay Loyal, one had to pass by the town proper in order to reach, in two (2) hours, Barangay Bagong Silang with the use of a motor vehicle. If a person were to travel on foot, the distance between the two (2) barangays can be covered in about five (5) hours.[13]On February 15, 1993, at around 9:00 o'clock in the evening, Rodolfo played \"dama\" in the house of his neighbor, Benjamin Grimaldo. He went home to sleep only after 10:00 o'clock in the evening.[14]The appellant denied using the alias name \"Dolfo\".[15] He likewise denied that he knew Willie Quibido, Jr. and Ruel Quibido on February 15, 1993. Rodolfo heard of their names through their sister, Rowena Quibido, whom he met in Minas, Victoria, Oriental Mindoro only on May 4, 1993, and who became his common-law wife on May 31, 1993.[16]On August 26, 1994, at 9:00 o'clock in the morning, Rowena and Rodolfo visited the house of the former's parents in Danggari, Victoria, Oriental Mindoro. Willie Quibido, Sr. and his wife, Rosita, including their sons, Jojo and Ruel Quibido, were present on the said occasion. At around 9:00 o'clock in the evening, a police team headed by a certain Magnayon raided the house of Willie Quibido, Sr. The police failed to arrest Willie Quibido, Sr. and his sons, Jojo and Ruel, for the reason that they had left earlier toward the forest at around 8:00 o'clock in the evening. Rodolfo and Rosita denied to the police having any knowledge on the whereabouts of Willie Quibido, Sr. and his sons,[17] namely, accused Willie Quibido, Jr. and Ruel Quibido.After the police had departed, appellant Rodolfo Montemayor and Rowena took Rosita to a relative in Poblacion, Victoria, Oriental Mindoro inasmuch as she needed to take medicine. On August 27, 1994, the three (3) proceeded to Barangay Loyal, Victoria, Oriental Mindoro. However, a person carrying a letter arrived and invited them to the police detachment for investigation. Upon arrival at the police detachment in Malayas, Victoria, Oriental Mindoro, the appellant was asked by Magnayon, who earlier headed the team that raided the house of Willie Quibido, where they could possibly find Willie Quibido and his sons Jojo and Ruel. When he answered in the negative, Magnayon warned that he (appellant) may be implicated in the crime.[18]On August 28, 1994, at around 3:00 o'clock in the afternoon, a certain Diego and Emil Berganio arrived at the Malayas police detachment. Magnayon introduced the appellant,, as the \"son-in-law of Willie Quibido, Sr. and brother-in-law of Ruel Quibido\", before Diego and Emil had a conversation with Magnayon inside the latter's office.[19] Thereafter, the appellant was brought to the PNP headquarters in Calapan City, Oriental Mindoro.Incidentally, after learning from a neighbor on February 16, 1993 of the death of Sofio Verguela, defense witness Pedrito B. de Lara went to see Sonny de Ocampo, who is the late Verguela's son-in-law, to inform him of what he saw on the evening of February 15, 1993 when the victim was purportedly killed. Pedrito related to Sonny that he met Willie Quibido, Jr. and Ruel Quibido together with two (2) other persons on February 15, 1993 at around 9:00 o'clock in the evening along the road in Barangay Bagong Silang, Victoria, Oriental Mindoro which was about fifty (50) meters away from the house of his father-in-law. He was on his way home after watching television in the house of his uncle while Willie Quibido, Jr., Ruel Quibido together with two (2) other persons were heading towards the opposite direction. He inquired where they were going (Saan ang lakad n'yo?) but nobody answered from the group inasmuch as they were walking hurriedly. Pedrito did not know the two (2) other companions of Willie Quibido, Jr. and Ruel Quibido although he saw their faces when he focussed his flashlight on them. He declared on the witness stand that appellant Rodolfo Montemayor was not one of the companions of the Quibido brothers.[20]In addition, Pedrito recalled that four (4) days prior to the killing of Sofio Verguela, Willie Quibido, Jr. invited him to join in robbing the store of a certain Angeles Vergara whose house was located directly across the house of the victim in Barangay Bagong Silang. Pedrito refused. He did not report the incident to the police authorities however, for the reason that he did not wish to offend Willie Quibido, Jr. who was a childhood friend.[21]After analyzing the evidence, the trial court found as follows: It is clear from the testimony of prosecution witness Emil Berganio that he was certain that said accused Rodolfo Montemayor alias \"Dolfo\" poked an airgun at the victim, while accused Ruel Quibido demanded money, and when the victim replied to have no money, Ruel Quibido hit the victim with a shotgun while accused only named \"Bokno\" stabbed him. In the face of the foregoing clear and positive identification of accused Rodolfo Montemayor, alias \"Dolfo\" as one of those who robbed and killed Sofio Verguela, his defense of alibi clearly appears nothing but a mere concoction \u2014 a fabrication designed to exculpate him of the crime charged. It is also striking to note that the defense did not even present in Court Benjamin Grimaldo to corroborate the testimonies given by accused Rodolfo Montermayor that the latter was playing \"dama\" with the former when the incident happened. This cast a grave doubt as to the veracity and truthfulness of the testimonies given by accused Rodolfo Montemayor. xxx the Court is more inclined to believe the testimonies given by prosecution witness Emil Berganio, whose veracity can hardly be assailed and had narrated in detail the facts of hove the crime was committed. Said witness was able to clearly identify the accused Ruel Quibido, Willie Quibido (Jr.) and Rodolfo Montemayor alias \"Dolfo\" as the perpetrators of the crime charged.From the clear evidence presented by the prosecution, accused Ruel Quibido did not put up a defense; instead, he opted to escape from detention. His escape even during the pendency of the case, is therefore a clear indication of his guilt,Hence, it ruled thus:ACCORDINGLY, finding herein accused RUEL QUIBIDO and RODOLFO MONTEMAYOR alias \"Dolfo\" guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the complex crime of \"Robbery with Homicide\" punishable under Article 294(1) of the Revised Penal Code, and there being no mitigating nor aggravating circumstance present in this case, said accused are hereby sentenced to suffer the penalty of \"RECLUSION PERPETUA\" with all the accessory penalties provided by law, and to indemnify the heirs of the victim Sofio Verguela the amount of Fifty Thousand Pesos (P50,000.00) as moral and exemplary damages and to pay the costs.Appellant Rodolfo Montemayor interposed the following assignment of errors:I. THE TRIAL COURT GRAVELY ERRED IN FINDING THE ACCUSED-APPELLANT GUILTY BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT OF THE CRIME OF ROBBERY WITH HOMICIDE DESPITE INSUFFICIENCY OF EVIDENCE.II THE COURT A QUO GRAVELY ERRED GIVING FULL WEIGHT AND CREDENCE TO THE INCREDIBLE TESTIMONY OF EMIL BERGANIO AND IN NOT APPRECIATING THE DEFENSE INTERPOSED BY THE ACCUSED APPELLANT.The trial court accorded full faith and credence to the testimony of the lone prosecution witness, Emil Berganio. On the other hand, appellant Rodolfo Montemayor contends in his appeal 1) that the execution of Emil Berganio's sworn statement after his arrest on November 11, 1994 cast serious doubt on his credibility; 2) that the physical evidence on record contradicts the testimony of Emil Berganio on material points; 3) that Berganio's testimony is highly incredible inasmuch as it contradicts human experience; and 4) that defense witness Pedrito de Lara categorically stated that the appellant was not one of the two companions of Willie Quibido, Jr. and Ruel Quibido in the evening of February 15, 1993.[22] Consequently, the fate of the instant appeal rests on the determination of the credibility of prosecution witness Emil Berganio.It is a well-settled rule that testimonial evidence to be believed must not only proceed from the mouth of a credible witness but must foremost be credible in itself.[23] The test to determine the value or credibility of testimony of a witness is whether or not such is in conformity with common knowledge and consistent with the experience of mankind.[24]Prosecution witness Emil Berganio confessed that he was in the company of herein appellant Rodolfo Montemayor alias Dolfo, Willie Quibido, Jr. and Ruel Quibido when they robbed and killed Sofio Verguela inside his house. in Bagong Silang, Victoria, Oriental Mindoro in the evening of February 15, 1993. However, the fact that he may have been a co-conspirator in the commission of the offense is not in itself sufficient to dilute the credibility of, much less a ground to disregard altogether, his testimony.The general rule is that the testimony of a co-conspirator is not sufficient for conviction unless supported by other evidence. The reason is that it comes from a polluted source. It must be received with caution because, as is usual with human nature, a culprit, confessing a crime, is likely to put the blame as far as possible on others rather than himself.[25]By way of exception, the testimony of a co-conspirator may, even if uncorroborated, be sufficient as when it is shown to be sincere in itself, because given unhesitatingly and in a straightforward manner, and is full of details which by their nature could not have been the result of deliberate afterthought.[26]Admittedly, Emil Berganio agreed to testify for the prosecution upon advice of his father after having been assured of immunity from the instant criminal complaint by the prosecution. True to his undertaking, Emil narrated during the trial in a candid and straightforward manner, a detailed account of the facts and circumstances before, during and after the commission of the crime, subject of the instant criminal case. In the course of his testimony, Emil clearly and positively identified in court the accused Ruel Quibido and herein appellant, Rodolfo Montemayor, as among the persons who robbed and killed Sofio Verguela.[27] He was consistent in his testimony and did not waver even during the extensive and rigorous cross-examination of the defense counsel, thus giving the Court a clear impression that he was sincere and credible.The trial court correctly rejected the defense of alibi of the appellant for the reason that he was positively identified by prosecution eyewitness Emil Berganio who does not appear to have any motive against him to fabricate evidence.[28] Also, the distance of the alleged whereabouts of the appellant in relation to the scene of the crime does not preclude any doubt on the physical impossibility of his presence at the locus criminis or its immediate vicinity at the time of its commission.[29]Hence, it has been established beyond reasonable doubt by the evidence on record that herein appellant Rodolfo Montemayor and his co-accused, Ruel Quibido and a certain Bokno, together with prosecution witness Emil Berganio went to Barangay Bagong Silang, Victoria, Oriental Mindoro in the late afternoon of February 15, 1993. Upon arrival thereat at 9:00 o'clock in the evening, Rodolfo, Ruel and Bokno entered the house of Sofio Verguela as earlier planned. Emil remained outside the house presumably to act as a look out. Ruel demanded money from Sofio while Rodolfo was pointing his airgun at him. Subsequently, Ruel hit Sofio's head with a shotgun when the latter who was an old man refused, stating that he had no money. They then divested Sofio of his wallet and radio before heading for the Victoria Public Market in Victoria, Oriental Mindoro en route to Calapan City. The group stayed for more than one (1) month in Nasugbu, Batangas before moving to Quezon City, Metro Manila. After more than two (2) months, Emil returned to Victoria, Oriental Mindoro where he was arrested by the police on November 11, 1994.Appellant Rodolfo Mantemayor contends that Emil Berganio could not have possibly witnessed the killing on February 15, 1993 of Sofio Verguela, whose lifeless body was found by the police Inside his room on the following day, inasmuch as according to Berganio, he remained outside the house. Appellant also contends that contrary to the testimony of Berganio to the effect that Bokno stabbed Sofio Verguela, the autopsy report dated February 16, 1993, did not reflect a finding of any stab wound on the body of the said victim.The above contentions of appellant are inadequate to overturn the established fact that Emil Berganio was in the company of the appellant and his co-accused in Barangay Bagong Silang, Victoria, Oriental Mindoro in the evening of February 15, 1993 when they robbed and killed Sofio Verguela inside his house. While Emil remained outside the house presumably to serve as a look out, his relative position was merely three (3) arms length away from the scene of the crime. Considering the proximity of his location and the illumination emanating from a gas lamp inside the house, it was not impossible for him to see the crime that was then unfolding.Likewise, the apparent discrepancy between the testimony of Emil Berganio that Bokno stabbed Sofio and the negative findings on the matter in the autopsy report is not sufficient to erode the credibility of his said testimony. Such misappreciation of Bokno's individual participation in the crime becomes immaterial in view of the fact that the prosecution witness has shown clearly and convincingly during the trial that he was aware of the violence that was being perpetrated by the appellant and his co-accused against Sofio Verguela in furtherance of their evil conspiracy. Emil testified in court that prior to the commission of the crime, Rodolfo and Ruel were respectively armed with an airgun and a shotgun. Rodolfo and his co-accused even discussed their plan[30] before entering the house of Sofio Verguela against the latter's will in Barangay Bagong Silang, Victoria, Oriental Mindoro.The appellant also contends that it was unlikely for Emil Berganio to have joined the appellant and Bokno, whom he admitted were not close acquaintances, after being invited to join them to go out of town allegedly to search for employment. This contention is bereft of merit for the reason that Bokno is a barrio mate[31] of Emil in Barangay Antonino, Victoria, Oriental Mindoro; and that he personally knew Bokno's brother, Ruel Quibido, who is also one of the accused in the case at bench. That Emil erroneously referred to Ruel Quibido's wife as Rowena, when the said name allegedly refers to Quibido's sister, who is the appellant's common-law-wife, is quite a minor detail that has no adverse bearing on his credibility.[32]Lastly, the testimony of defense witness Pedrito de Lara that herein appellant was not one of the two (2) companions of Willie Quibido, Jr. and Ruel Quibido appears doubtful or unreliable in view of the fact that it was dark when he met them by chance in the evening of February 15, 1995. According to him, he was able to focus his flashlight at them for about sixty (60) seconds only inasmuch as they were in a hurry and avoided any conversation with him. In fact, he only recognized Willie Quibido, Jr. and Ruel Quibido[33] whom he already knew from childhood.In view of the foregoing, the guilt of the appellant for the crime of robbery with homicide was established beyond reasonable doubt. Article 294 (1) of the Revised Penal Code provides: ART. 294. Any person guilty of robbery with the use of violence against or any person shall suffer: The penalty of reclusion perpetua to death, when by reason or on occasion of the robbery, the crime of homicide shall have been committed, or when the robbery shall have been accompanied by rape or intentional mutilation or arson.Notably, the aggravating circumstances of treachery, nocturnity and dwelling attended the commission of the robbery and the killing of Sofio Verguela on the occasion thereof. Still, the proper imposable penalty is reclusion perpetua considering that at the time of the commission of the crime on February 15, 1993, the imposition of the death penalty was legally proscribed.WHEREFORE, the appealed Decision of the Regional Trial Court of Calapan City, Oriental Mindoro, Branch 40, is AFFIRMED. The appellant, Rodolfo Montemayor, is hereby sentenced to suffer the penalty of reclusion perpetua and to pay to the heirs of the victim Soflo Verguela, the amount of P50,000.00 by way of civil indemnity ex delicto in addition to the amount of P50,000.00 as exemplary damages and to restore to the said heirs the stolen items belonging to the victim.SO ORDERED.Bellosillo, (Chairman), Mendoza, Quisumbing, and Buena, JJ., concur.[1] Penned by Judge Tomas C.

His head was bashed with a blunt instrument fracturing the skull and exposing parts of his brain tissues. It was also discovered that one (1) blanket, one (1) radio and a wallet containing undetermined amount of money, all belonging to the victim, were missing. [2]\n\nOn February 24, 1993, Luciano M. Vergara and Pedrito B. de Lara executed separate sworn statements before PO3 Herbert Tabernero of the Victoria, Oriental Mindoro police. Vergara stated in his sworn statement that he saw Willie Quibido, Jr., Ruel Quibido, a certain alias Dolfo, and another unidentified person, acting suspiciously while in the act of coming out of the house of the victim, at about the same time the killing incident happened at 9:00 o\u2019clock in the evening on February 15, 1993. On the other hand, de Lara was able to recognize from the group Willie Quibido, Jr. only. [3] Consequently, the accused Willie Quibido, Jr., Ruel Quibido, a John Doe and a Peter Doe were charged with the crime of robbery with homicide, defined and penalized under Article 294, paragraph 1 of the Revised Penal Code, in an information that reads:\n\nThat on or about the 15th day of February 1993, at around 9:00 o\u2019clock in the evening, in Barangay Bagong Silang, Municipality of Victoria, Province of Oriental Mindoro, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, conspiring, confederating and mutually helping one another, taking advantage of the darkness of the night, with evident premeditation and by means of violence, did then and there wilfully, unlawfully and feloniously enter the house of SOFIO VERGUELA also known as SOFIO VERGUERA and once inside, wilfully, unlawfully and feloniously, with the use of violence, with intent to gain and against the will and consent of the owner thereof, took and carried away one (1) radio, one (1) blanket, one (1) wallet and undetermined amount of money all belonging to the latter, to the damage and prejudice of the said owner in the value of properties aforementioned;\n\nThat on the occasion of said robbery and for the purpose of enabling them to take, steal and carry away the properties above-mentioned, the herein accused, in pursuance of their conspiracy and taking advantage of their superior strength, did then and there wilfully, unlawfully, feloniously and treacherously, with intent to kill and evident premeditation, attack, assault and hit on the head with a hard object the said SOFIO VERGUELA also known as SOFIO VERGUERA, thereby inflicting on the latter severe brain injury due to skull fracture resulting in his untimely death.\n\nCONTRARY TO LAW.\n\nWillie Quibido, Jr. was never apprehended and remains at large up to the present. Herein appellant Rodolfo Montemayor who was initially denominated as John Doe in the information in this case, and his co-accused, Ruel Quibido, were arrested on August 29, 1994 and September 5, 1994, respectively. Upon being arraigned on September 28, 1994, Rodolfo Montemayor, alias Dolfo, and Ruel Quibido, [4] both assisted by counsel de oficio , separately entered the plea of \u201cNot guilty\u201d.\n\nMeanwhile, Emil Berganio was arrested by the police on November 11, 1994. After having agreed to testify in favor of the prosecution, Berganio\u2019s name was not included in the information as one of the accused in this case. On the same date of his arrest, his sworn statement [5] was taken and which he subscribed and sworn to before Oriental Mindoro Chief Assistant Provincial Prosecutor Nicolas B. Senoren.\n\nThe evidence of the prosecution shows that on February 15, 1993 at around 5:00 o\u2019clock in the afternoon the appellant, Rodolfo Montemayor alias Dolfo, and a certain Bokno invited Emil Berganio, a barrio mate in Barangay Antonino, Victoria, Oriental Mindoro, to join them to go out of town in search for employment. Emil went with Dolfo and Bokno upon learning that they were supposed to leave early on the following morning after they shall have allegedly collected a debt, to be used for their fare to Batangas, from a certain person in Barangay Bagong Silang, Victoria, Oriental Mindoro. [6]\n\nWhile walking alongside the NIA irrigation canal, the trio met Bokno\u2019s brother, Ruel Quibido, and his wife at a waiting shed. The group then boarded a passenger jeepney that took them to the neighboring Barangay Macatoc. From Barangay Macatoc, they proceeded on foot to the nearby Barangay Bagong Silang. [7]\n\nAs planned earlier, Ruel, Bokno and Dolfo entered a two (2) storey house in Barangay Bagong Silang, Victoria, Oriental Mindoro at around 9:00 o\u2019clock in the evening. Emil remained outside the house presumably as look out, while Ruel\u2019s wife was left outside the fence. From a distance of about three (3) arms length, Emil saw Ruel through the light emanating from a gas lamp inside the house, demanded money from an old man, whose name Emil later learned as Sofio Verguela, while Dolfo was pointing his airgun at him. When the old man replied that he had no money, Ruel hit him on the head with the shotgun which he earlier carried inside a sack, and then Bokno stabbed him. After the old man fell on the floor, Ruel took his wallet, while the others took his radio, before they hurriedly left for Poblacion, Victoria, Oriental Mindoro. [8]\n\nAfter a few hours, the group rode the bus at the public market in Victoria, Oriental Mindoro en route to Calapan City. Upon reaching Calapan City, they dropped by the house of Ruel Quibido\u2019s mother for a few minutes before they boarded the boat at the pier bound for Batangas. They stayed in the house of Ruel Quibido\u2019s parents-in-law in Nasugbu, Batangas for more than one (1) month. Subsequently, they moved to Metro Manila in the house of Ruel Quibido\u2019s uncle in Quezon City where they stayed for more than two (2) months after which Emil decided to return home in Victoria, Oriental Mindoro ahead of his companions. [9] Emil disclosed to the police his knowledge involving the killing of Sofio Verguela when he was arrested on November 11, 1994, upon the advice of his father, after he was assured by the police of immunity from the instant criminal case. [10]\n\nDr. Ruben A. Quimosing, M.D., Municipal Health Officer of Victoria, oriental, Mindoro during the time material to the instant case, conducted the post mortem examination on the body of the victim, Sofio Verguela. The autopsy report dated February 16, 1993 and signed by Dr. Ruben A. Quimosing shows the following findings:\n\nSkull, open\nBrain tissue, avulsed, with laceration\nCause of death: Severe brain injury due to skull fracture. [11]\n\nDr. Quimosing testified in court that the single blow sustained by the victim on the frontal left portion of his head which fractured the skull caused severe brain injury that inevitably resulted to his instantaneous death. The blow may have been inflicted with the use of any hard object while the victim and the assailant were facing each other. [12]\n\nThe defense denied any liability for the crime of robbery with homicide. Apellant Rodolfo Montemayor testified that on February 15, 1993 and during the period prior thereto, he shared a house with his brother, Randy Montemayor, in Barangay Loyal, Victoria, Oriental Mondoro which is about twenty (20) kilometers of mountainous terrain from Barangay Bagong Silang of the same town. From Barangay Loyal, one had to pass by the town proper in order to reach, in two (2) hours, Barangay Bagong Silang with the use of a motor vehicle. If a person were to travel on foot, the distance between the two (2) barangays can be covered in about five (5) hours. [13]\n\nOn February 15, 1993, at around 9:00 o'clock in the evening, Rodolfo played \"dama\" in the house of his neighbor, Benjamin Grimaldo. He went home to sleep only after 10:00 o'clock in the evening. [14]\n\nThe appellant denied using the alias name \"Dolfo\". [15] He likewise denied that he knew Willie Quibido, Jr. and Ruel Quibido on February 15, 1993. Rodolfo heard of their names through their sister, Rowena Quibido, whom he met in Minas, Victoria, Oriental Mindoro only on May 4, 1993, and who became his common-law wife on May 31, 1993. [16]\n\nOn August 26, 1994, at 9:00 o'clock in the morning, Rowena and Rodolfo visited the house of the former's parents in Danggari, Victoria, Oriental Mindoro. Willie Quibido, Sr. and his wife, Rosita, including their sons, Jojo and Ruel Quibido, were present on the said occasion. At around 9:00 o'clock in the evening, a police team headed by a certain Magnayon raided the house of Willie Quibido, Sr. The police failed to arrest Willie Quibido, Sr. and his sons, Jojo and Ruel, for the reason that they had left earlier toward the forest at around 8:00 o'clock in the evening. Rodolfo and Rosita denied to the police having any knowledge on the whereabouts of Willie Quibido, Sr. and his sons, [17] namely, accused Willie Quibido, Jr. and Ruel Quibido.\n\nAfter the police had departed, appellant Rodolfo Montemayor and Rowena took Rosita to a relative in Poblacion, Victoria, Oriental Mindoro inasmuch as she needed to take medicine. On August 27, 1994, the three (3) proceeded to Barangay Loyal, Victoria, Oriental Mindoro. However, a person carrying a letter arrived and invited them to the police detachment for investigation. Upon arrival at the police detachment in Malayas, Victoria, Oriental Mindoro, the appellant was asked by Magnayon, who earlier headed the team that raided the house of Willie Quibido, where they could possibly find Willie Quibido and his sons Jojo and Ruel. When he answered in the negative, Magnayon warned that he (appellant) may be implicated in the crime. [18]\n\nOn August 28, 1994, at around 3:00 o'clock in the afternoon, a certain Diego and Emil Berganio arrived at the Malayas police detachment. Magnayon introduced the appellant,, as the \"son-in-law of Willie Quibido, Sr. and brother-in-law of Ruel Quibido\", before Diego and Emil had a conversation with Magnayon inside the latter's office. [19] Thereafter, the appellant was brought to the PNP headquarters in Calapan City, Oriental Mindoro.\n\nIncidentally, after learning from a neighbor on February 16, 1993 of the death of Sofio Verguela, defense witness Pedrito B. de Lara went to see Sonny de Ocampo, who is the late Verguela's son-in-law, to inform him of what he saw on the evening of February 15, 1993 when the victim was purportedly killed. Pedrito related to Sonny that he met Willie Quibido, Jr. and Ruel Quibido together with two (2) other persons on February 15, 1993 at around 9:00 o'clock in the evening along the road in Barangay Bagong Silang, Victoria, Oriental Mindoro which was about fifty (50) meters away from the house of his father-in-law. He was on his way home after watching television in the house of his uncle while Willie Quibido, Jr., Ruel Quibido together with two (2) other persons were heading towards the opposite direction. He inquired where they were going ( Saan ang lakad n'yo? ) but nobody answered from the group inasmuch as they were walking hurriedly. Pedrito did not know the two (2) other companions of Willie Quibido, Jr. and Ruel Quibido although he saw their faces when he focussed his flashlight on them. He declared on the witness stand that appellant Rodolfo Montemayor was not one of the companions of the Quibido brothers. [20]\n\nIn addition, Pedrito recalled that four (4) days prior to the killing of Sofio Verguela, Willie Quibido, Jr. invited him to join in robbing the store of a certain Angeles Vergara whose house was located directly across the house of the victim in Barangay Bagong Silang. Pedrito refused. He did not report the incident to the police authorities however, for the reason that he did not wish to offend Willie Quibido, Jr. who was a childhood friend. [21]\n\nAfter analyzing the evidence, the trial court found as follows:\n\nIt is clear from the testimony of prosecution witness Emil Berganio that he was certain that said accused Rodolfo Montemayor alias \"Dolfo\" poked an airgun at the victim, while accused Ruel Quibido demanded money, and when the victim replied to have no money, Ruel Quibido hit the victim with a shotgun while accused only named \"Bokno\" stabbed him.\n\nIn the face of the foregoing clear and positive identification of accused Rodolfo Montemayor, alias \"Dolfo\" as one of those who robbed and killed Sofio Verguela, his defense of alibi clearly appears nothing but a mere concoction \u2014 a fabrication designed to exculpate him of the crime charged.\n\nIt is also striking to note that the defense did not even present in Court Benjamin Grimaldo to corroborate the testimonies given by accused Rodolfo Montermayor that the latter was playing \"dama\" with the former when the incident happened. This cast a grave doubt as to the veracity and truthfulness of the testimonies given by accused Rodolfo Montemayor.\n\nxxx the Court is more inclined to believe the testimonies given by prosecution witness Emil Berganio, whose veracity can hardly be assailed and had narrated in detail the facts of hove the crime was committed. Said witness was able to clearly identify the accused Ruel Quibido, Willie Quibido (Jr.) and Rodolfo Montemayor alias \"Dolfo\" as the perpetrators of the crime charged. From the clear evidence presented by the prosecution, accused Ruel Quibido did not put up a defense; instead, he opted to escape from detention. His escape even during the pendency of the case, is therefore a clear indication of his guilt,\n\nHence, it ruled thus:\n\nACCORDINGLY, finding herein accused RUEL QUIBIDO and RODOLFO MONTEMAYOR alias \"Dolfo\" guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the complex crime of \"Robbery with Homicide\" punishable under Article 294(1) of the Revised Penal Code, and there being no mitigating nor aggravating circumstance present in this case, said accused are hereby sentenced to suffer the penalty of \"RECLUSION PERPETUA\" with all the accessory penalties provided by law, and to indemnify the heirs of the victim Sofio Verguela the amount of Fifty Thousand Pesos (P50,000.00) as moral and exemplary damages and to pay the costs.\n\nAppellant Rodolfo Montemayor interposed the following assignment of errors:\n\nI.\n\nTHE TRIAL COURT GRAVELY ERRED IN FINDING THE ACCUSED-APPELLANT GUILTY BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT OF THE CRIME OF ROBBERY WITH HOMICIDE DESPITE INSUFFICIENCY OF EVIDENCE.\n\nII\n\nTHE COURT A QUO GRAVELY ERRED GIVING FULL WEIGHT AND CREDENCE TO THE INCREDIBLE TESTIMONY OF EMIL BERGANIO AND IN NOT APPRECIATING THE DEFENSE INTERPOSED BY THE ACCUSED APPELLANT.\n\nThe trial court accorded full faith and credence to the testimony of the lone prosecution witness, Emil Berganio. On the other hand, appellant Rodolfo Montemayor contends in his appeal 1) that the execution of Emil Berganio's sworn statement after his arrest on November 11, 1994 cast serious doubt on his credibility; 2) that the physical evidence on record contradicts the testimony of Emil Berganio on material points; 3) that Berganio's testimony is highly incredible inasmuch as it contradicts human experience; and 4) that defense witness Pedrito de Lara categorically stated that the appellant was not one of the two companions of Willie Quibido, Jr. and Ruel Quibido in the evening of February 15, 1993. [22] Consequently, the fate of the instant appeal rests on the determination of the credibility of prosecution witness Emil Berganio.\n\nIt is a well-settled rule that testimonial evidence to be believed must not only proceed from the mouth of a credible witness but must foremost be credible in itself. [23] The test to determine the value or credibility of testimony of a witness is whether or not such is in conformity with common knowledge and consistent with the experience of mankind. [24]\n\nProsecution witness Emil Berganio confessed that he was in the company of herein appellant Rodolfo Montemayor alias Dolfo, Willie Quibido, Jr. and Ruel Quibido when they robbed and killed Sofio Verguela inside his house. in Bagong Silang, Victoria, Oriental Mindoro in the evening of February 15, 1993. However, the fact that he may have been a co-conspirator in the commission of the offense is not in itself sufficient to dilute the credibility of, much less a ground to disregard altogether, his testimony.\n\nThe general rule is that the testimony of a co-conspirator is not sufficient for conviction unless supported by other evidence. The reason is that it comes from a polluted source. It must be received with caution because, as is usual with human nature, a culprit, confessing a crime, is likely to put the blame as far as possible on others rather than himself. [25]\n\nBy way of exception, the testimony of a co-conspirator may, even if uncorroborated, be sufficient as when it is shown to be sincere in itself, because given unhesitatingly and in a straightforward manner, and is full of details which by their nature could not have been the result of deliberate afterthought. [26]\n\nAdmittedly, Emil Berganio agreed to testify for the prosecution upon advice of his father after having been assured of immunity from the instant criminal complaint by the prosecution. True to his undertaking, Emil narrated during the trial in a candid and straightforward manner, a detailed account of the facts and circumstances before, during and after the commission of the crime, subject of the instant criminal case. In the course of his testimony, Emil clearly and positively identified in court the accused Ruel Quibido and herein appellant, Rodolfo Montemayor, as among the persons who robbed and killed Sofio Verguela. [27] He was consistent in his testimony and did not waver even during the extensive and rigorous cross-examination of the defense counsel, thus giving the Court a clear impression that he was sincere and credible.\n\nThe trial court correctly rejected the defense of alibi of the appellant for the reason that he was positively identified by prosecution eyewitness Emil Berganio who does not appear to have any motive against him to fabricate evidence. [28] Also, the distance of the alleged whereabouts of the appellant in relation to the scene of the crime does not preclude any doubt on the physical impossibility of his presence at the locus criminis or its immediate vicinity at the time of its commission. [29]\n\nHence, it has been established beyond reasonable doubt by the evidence on record that herein appellant Rodolfo Montemayor and his co-accused, Ruel Quibido and a certain Bokno, together with prosecution witness Emil Berganio went to Barangay Bagong Silang, Victoria, Oriental Mindoro in the late afternoon of February 15, 1993. Upon arrival thereat at 9:00 o'clock in the evening, Rodolfo, Ruel and Bokno entered the house of Sofio Verguela as earlier planned. Emil remained outside the house presumably to act as a look out. Ruel demanded money from Sofio while Rodolfo was pointing his airgun at him. Subsequently, Ruel hit Sofio's head with a shotgun when the latter who was an old man refused, stating that he had no money. They then divested Sofio of his wallet and radio before heading for the Victoria Public Market in Victoria, Oriental Mindoro en route to Calapan City. The group stayed for more than one (1) month in Nasugbu, Batangas before moving to Quezon City, Metro Manila. After more than two (2) months, Emil returned to Victoria, Oriental Mindoro where he was arrested by the police on November 11, 1994.\n\nAppellant Rodolfo Mantemayor contends that Emil Berganio could not have possibly witnessed the killing on February 15, 1993 of Sofio Verguela, whose lifeless body was found by the police Inside his room on the following day, inasmuch as according to Berganio, he remained outside the house. Appellant also contends that contrary to the testimony of Berganio to the effect that Bokno stabbed Sofio Verguela, the autopsy report dated February 16, 1993, did not reflect a finding of any stab wound on the body of the said victim.\n\nThe above contentions of appellant are inadequate to overturn the established fact that Emil Berganio was in the company of the appellant and his co-accused in Barangay Bagong Silang, Victoria, Oriental Mindoro in the evening of February 15, 1993 when they robbed and killed Sofio Verguela inside his house. While Emil remained outside the house presumably to serve as a look out, his relative position was merely three (3) arms length away from the scene of the crime. Considering the proximity of his location and the illumination emanating from a gas lamp inside the house, it was not impossible for him to see the crime that was then unfolding.\n\nLikewise, the apparent discrepancy between the testimony of Emil Berganio that Bokno stabbed Sofio and the negative findings on the matter in the autopsy report is not sufficient to erode the credibility of his said testimony. Such misappreciation of Bokno's individual participation in the crime becomes immaterial in view of the fact that the prosecution witness has shown clearly and convincingly during the trial that he was aware of the violence that was being perpetrated by the appellant and his co-accused against Sofio Verguela in furtherance of their evil conspiracy. Emil testified in court that prior to the commission of the crime, Rodolfo and Ruel were respectively armed with an airgun and a shotgun. Rodolfo and his co-accused even discussed their plan [30] before entering the house of Sofio Verguela against the latter's will in Barangay Bagong Silang, Victoria, Oriental Mindoro.\n\nThe appellant also contends that it was unlikely for Emil Berganio to have joined the appellant and Bokno, whom he admitted were not close acquaintances, after being invited to join them to go out of town allegedly to search for employment. This contention is bereft of merit for the reason that Bokno is a barrio mate [31] of Emil in Barangay Antonino, Victoria, Oriental Mindoro; and that he personally knew Bokno's brother, Ruel Quibido, who is also one of the accused in the case at bench. That Emil erroneously referred to Ruel Quibido's wife as Rowena, when the said name allegedly refers to Quibido's sister, who is the appellant's common-law-wife, is quite a minor detail that has no adverse bearing on his credibility. [32]\n\nLastly, the testimony of defense witness Pedrito de Lara that herein appellant was not one of the two (2) companions of Willie Quibido, Jr. and Ruel Quibido appears doubtful or unreliable in view of the fact that it was dark when he met them by chance in the evening of February 15, 1995. According to him, he was able to focus his flashlight at them for about sixty (60) seconds only inasmuch as they were in a hurry and avoided any conversation with him. In fact, he only recognized Willie Quibido, Jr. and Ruel Quibido [33] whom he already knew from childhood.\n\nIn view of the foregoing, the guilt of the appellant for the crime of robbery with homicide was established beyond reasonable doubt. Article 294 (1) of the Revised Penal Code provides:\n\nART. 294. Any person guilty of robbery with the use of violence against or any person shall suffer: The penalty of reclusion perpetua to death, when by reason or on occasion of the robbery, the crime of homicide shall have been committed, or when the robbery shall have been accompanied by rape or intentional mutilation or arson.\n\nNotably, the aggravating circumstances of treachery, nocturnity and dwelling attended the commission of the robbery and the killing of Sofio Verguela on the occasion thereof. Still, the proper imposable penalty is reclusion perpetua considering that at the time of the commission of the crime on February 15, 1993, the imposition of the death penalty was legally proscribed.\n\nWHEREFORE , the appealed Decision of the Regional Trial Court of Calapan City, Oriental Mindoro, Branch 40, is AFFIRMED . The appellant, Rodolfo Montemayor, is hereby sentenced to suffer the penalty of reclusion perpetua and to pay to the heirs of the victim Soflo Verguela, the amount of P50,000.00 by way of civil indemnity ex delicto in addition to the amount of P50,000.00 as exemplary damages and to restore to the said heirs the stolen items belonging to the victim.\n\nSO ORDERED.\n\nBellosillo, (Chairman), Mendoza, Quisumbing, and Buena, JJ., concur.\n\n[1] Penned by Judge Tomas C.

      "title": "PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, PLAINTIFF-APPELLEE, VS. VICENTE TY AND CARMEN TY, ACCUSED-APPELLANTS. D E C I S I O N KAPUNAN, J.: Vicente Ty AND Carmen Ty were charged with the crime of kidnapping and failure to return a minor in an information filed by 2nd Assistant City Prosecutor of Kalookan City Rosauro J. Silverio, the accusatory portion of which reads:That on or about the month of April 1989, in Kalookan City, Metro Manila, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, being then the owners, proprietors, managers and administrators of Sir John Clinic and as such said accused had the custody of Arabella Somblong, a minor, conspiring together and mutually helping one another and with deliberate intent to deprive the parents of the child of her custody, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously fail to restore the custody of said Arabella Sombong to her parents by giving said custody of subject minor to another person without the knowledge and consent of her parents Contrary to Law.[1]Both accused were arrested, and then arraigned on October 27, 1992 when they pleaded not guilty to the crime charged.After trial, on May 31, 1995, a decision was rendered by the Regional Trial Court of Kalookan City, Branch 123, the decretal portion of which disposes as follows:WHEREFORE, this Court finds both accused Spouses Vicente Ty and Carmen Ty guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of kidnapping a minor and failure to return the same as defined and penalized by Article 270 of the Revised Penal Code and hereby sentences them to suffer imprisonment of reclusion perpetua. The accused are hereby ordered to pay the private complainant the sum of P100,000.00 by way of moral damages caused by anxiety, by her being emotionally drained coupled by the fact that up to this date she could not determine the whereabouts of her child Arabella Sombong.SO ORDERED.[2]The accused now interposes this appeal alleging the ensuing assignment of errors, viz:I THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN FINDING THAT APPELLANTS \u2018DELIBERATELY FAILED TO RESTORE THE CHILD TO HER MOTHER,\u2019 AND CONVICTING THEM UNDER ART. 270 OF THE REVISED PENAL CODE, AND SENTENCING THEM TO \u2018RECLUSION PERPETUA\u2019;II THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN NOT HOLDING THAT THE CRIME COMMITTED, IF ANY, IS THAT DEFINED AND PENALIZED UNDER ART. 227 OF THE REVISED PENAL CODE;III THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN NOT RECOMMENDING EXECUTIVE CLEMENCY PURSUANT TO PRECEDENT IN \u2018PEOPLE vs. GUTIERREZ,\u2019 197 SCRA 569; andIV THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN AWARDING \u2018COMPLAINANT THE SUM OF P100,000.00 BY WAY OF MORAL DAMAGES.\u2019[3]The relevant antecedents surrounding the case are as follows:On November 18, 1987, complainant Johanna Sombong brought her sick daughter Arabella, then only seven (7) months old, for treatment to the Sir John Medical and Maternity Clinic located at No. 121 First Avenue, Grace Park, Kalookan City which was owned and operated by the accused-appellants. Arabella was diagnosed to be suffering bronchitis and diarrhea, thus complainant was advised to confine the child at the clinic for speedy recovery. About three (3) days later, Arabella was well and was ready to be discharged but complainant was not around to take her home. A week later, complainant came back but did not have enough money to pay the hospital bill in the amount of P300.00. Complainant likewise confided to accused-appellant Dr. Carmen Ty that no one would take care of the child at home as she was working. She then inquired about the rate of the nursery and upon being told that the same was P50.00 per day, she decided to leave her child to the care of the clinic nursery. Consequently, Arabella was transferred from the ward to the nursery.[4]Thereafter, hospital bills started to mount and accumulate. It was at this time that accused-appellant Dr. Ty suggested to the complainant that she hire a \u201cyaya\u201d for P400.00 instead of the daily nursery fee of P50.00. Complainant agreed, hence, a \u201cyaya\u201d was hired. Arabella was then again transferred from the nursery to the extension of the clinic which served as residence for the hospital staff.[5]From then on, nothing was heard of the complainant. She neither visited her child nor called to inquire about her whereabouts. Her estranged husband came to the clinic once but did not get the child. Efforts to get in touch with the complainant were unsuccessful as she left no address or telephone number where she can be reached. This development prompted Dr. Ty to notify the barangay captain of the child\u2019s abandonment.[6] Eventually, the hospital staff took turns in taking care of Arabella.[7]Sometime in 1989, two (2) years after Arabella was abandoned by complainant, Dr. Fe Mallonga, a dentist at the clinic, suggested during a hospital staff conference that Arabella be entrusted to a guardian who could give the child the love and affection, personal attention and caring she badly needed as she was thin and sickly. The suggestion was favorably considered, hence, Dr. Mallonga gave the child to her aunt, Lilibeth Neri.[8]In 1992, complainant came back to claim the daughter she abandoned some five (5) years back.When her pleas allegedly went unanswered, she filed a petition for habeas corpus against accused-appellants with the Regional Trial Court of Quezon City. Said petition was however denied due course and was summarily dismissed without prejudice on the ground of lack of jurisdiction, the alleged detention having been perpetrated in Kalookan City.Thereafter, the instant criminal case was filed against accused-appellants.Complainant likewise filed an administrative case for dishonorable conduct against accused-appellant Dr. Carmen Ty before the Board of Medicine of the Professional Regulation Commission. This case was subsequently dismissed for failure to prosecute.On October 13, 1992, complainant filed a petition for habeas corpus with the Regional Trial Court of Quezon City, this time against the alleged guardians of her daughter, namely, Marietta Neri Alviar and Lilibeth Neri. On January 15, 1993, the trial court rendered a decision granting the petition and ordering the guardians to immediately deliver the person of Cristina Grace Neri to the complainant, the court having found Cristina to be the complainant\u2019s child. On appeal to the Court of Appeals, however, said decision was reversed on the ground that the guardians were not unlawfully withholding from the complainant the rightful custody of Cristina after finding that Cristina and complainant\u2019s daughter are not one and the same person. On January 31, 1996, this Court in Sombong v. Court of Appeals[9] affirmed the Court of Appeals\u2019 decision.In this appeal, accused-appellants would want us to take a second look and resolve the issue of whether or not they are guilty of kidnapping and failure to return a minor. Accused-appellants of course contend that they are not guilty and the Solicitor General agrees. In its Manifestations and Motion in lieu of Appellee\u2019s Brief, the Office of the Solicitor General recommends their acquittal.We agree.As we have mentioned above, this Court in Sombong v. Court of Appeals[10] affirmed the decision of the Court of Appeals reversing the trial court\u2019s ruling that complainant has rightful custody over the child, Cristina Grace Neri, the latter not being identical with complainant\u2019s daughter, Arabella. The Court discoursed, thusly:Petitioner does not have the right of custody over the minor Cristina because, by the evidence disclosed before the court a quo, Cristina has not been shown to be petitioner\u2019s daughter, Arabella. The evidence adduced before the trial court does not warrant the conclusion that Arabella is the same person as Cristina. x x x x x x x x x In the instant case, the testimonial and circumstantial proof establishes the individual and separate existence of petitioner\u2019s child, Arabella, from that of private respondents\u2019 foster child, Cristina.We note, among others, that Dr. Trono, who is petitioner\u2019s own witness, testified in court that, together with Arabella, there were several babies left in the clinic and so she could not be certain whether it was Arabella or some their baby that was given to private respondents. Petitioner\u2019s own evidence shows that, after the confinement of Arabella in the clinic in 1987, she saw her daughter again only in 1989 when she visited the clinic. This corroborates the testimony of petitioner\u2019s own witness, Dra. Ty, that Arabella was physically confined in the clinic from November, 1987 to April, 1989. This testimony tallies with her assertion in her counter-affidavit to the effect that Arabella was in the custody of the hospital until April, 1989. All this, when juxtaposed with the unwavering declaration of private respondents that they obtained custody of Cristina in April, 1988 and had her baptized at the Good Samaritan Church on April 30, 1988, leads to the conclusions that Cristina is not Arabella.Significantly, Justice Lourdes K. Tayao-Jaguros, herself a mother and the ponente of the herein assailed decision, set the case for hearing on August 30, 1993 primarily for the purpose of observing petitioner\u2019s demeanor towards the minor Cristina. She made the following personal but relevant manifestation:The undersigned ponente as a mother herself of four children, wanted to see how petitioner as an alleged mother of a missing child supposedly in the person of Cristina Neri would react on seeing again her long lost child. The petitioner appeared in the scheduled hearing of this case late, and she walked inside the courtroom looking for a seat without even stopping at her alleged daughter\u2019s seat; without even casting a glance on said child, and without even that tearful embrace which characterizes the reunion of a loving mother with her missing dear child. Throughout the proceedings, the undersigned ponente noticed no signs of endearment and affection expected of a mother who had been deprived of the embrace of her little child for many years. The conclusion or finding of undersigned ponente as a mother, herself, that petitioner-appellee is not the mother of Cristina Neri has been given support by aforestated observation xxx. x x x x x x x x x Since we hold that petitioner has not been established by evidence to be entitled to the custody of the minor Cristina on account of mistaken identity, it cannot be said that private respondents are unlawfully withholding from petitioner the rightful custody over Cristina. At this juncture, we need not inquire into the validity of the mode by which private respondents acquired custodial rights over the minor, Cristina. x x x x x x x x x Under the facts and ruling in Sombong, as well as the evidence adduced in this case accused-appellants must perforce be acquitted of the crime charged, there being no reason to hold them liable for failing to return one Cristina Grace Neri, a child not conclusively shown and established to be complainant\u2019s daugther, Arabella.The foregoing notwithstanding, even if we were to consider Cristina Grace Neri and Arabella Sombong as one and the same person, still, the instant criminal case against the accused-appellants must fall.Before a conviction for kidnapping and failure to return a minor under Article 270 of the Revised Penal Code can be had, two elements must concur, namely: (a) the offender has been entrusted with the custody of the minor, and (b) the offender deliberately fails to restore said minor to his parents or guardians. The essential element herein is that the offender is entrusted with the custody of the minor but what is actually punishable is not the kidnapping of the minor, as the title of the article seems to indicate, but rather the deliberate failure or refusal of the custodian of the minor to restore the latter to his parents or guardians.[11] Said failure or refusal, however, must not only be deliberate but must also be persistent as to oblige the parents or the guardians of the child to seek the aid of the courts in order to obtain custody.[12] The key word therefore of this element is deliberate and Black\u2019s Law Dictionary defines deliberate as:Deliberate, adj. Well advised; carefully considered; not sudden or rash; circumspect; slow in determining. Willful rather than merely intentional. Formed, arrived at, or determined upon as a result of careful thought and weighing of considerations, as a deliberate judgment or plan. Carried on coolly and steadily, especially according to a preconceived design; given to weighing facts and arguments with a view to a choice or decision; careful in considering the consequences of a step; slow in action; unhurried; characterized by reflection; dispassionate; not rash. People v. Thomas, 25 Cal. 2d 880, 156 P. 2d 7, 17, 18.By the use of this word, in describing a crime, the idea is conveyed that the perpetrator weighs the motives for the act and its consequences, the nature of the crime, or other things connected with his intentions, with a view to a decision thereon; that he carefully considers all these, and that the act is not suddenly committed. It implies that the perpetrator must be capable of the exercise of such mental powers as are called into use by deliberation and the consideration and weighing of motives and consequences.[13]Similarly, the word deliberate is defined in Corpus Juris Secundum as:DELIBERATE.As a VerbThe word is derived from two Latin words which mean literally \u2018concerning\u2019 and \u2018to weigh,\u2019 it implies the possession of a mind capable of conceiving a purpose to act, and the exercise of such mental powers as are called into use by the consideration and weighing of the motives and the consequences of the act; and has been defined as meaning to consider, reflect, take counsel, or to weigh the arguments for and against a proposed course of action; to consider and examine the reasons for and against, consider maturely, ponder, reflect upon, or weigh in the mind; to reflect, with a view to make a choice; to weigh the motives for an act and its consequences, with a view to a decision thereon.As an AdjectiveThe word, used adjectively, implies action after thought and reflection, and relates to the end proposed; indicates a purpose formed in a mind capable of conceiving a purpose; and is based upon an intention accompanied by such circumstances as evidence a mind fully conscious of its own purpose and design. It has been defined as meaning carefully considered; circumspect; entered upon after deliberation and with fixed purpose, formed after careful consideration, and fully or carefully considering the nature or consequences of an act or measure; maturely reflected; not sudden or rash, carefully considering the probable consequences of a step; premeditated; slow in determining; weighing facts and arguments with a view to a choice of decision; well-advised.Under some circumstances, it has been held synonymous with, or equivalent to, \u2018intentional,\u2019 \u2018premeditated,\u2019 and \u2018willful.\u2019Under other circumstances, however, it has been compared with, or distinguished from, \u2018premeditated,\u2019 \u2018sudden,\u2019 and \u2018willful.\u2019[14]Essentially, the word deliberate as used in the article must imply something more than mere negligence; it must be premeditated, obstinate, headstrong, foolishly daring or intentionally and maliciously wrong.In the case at bar, it is evident that there was no deliberate refusal or failure on the part of the accused-appellants to restore the custody of the complainant\u2019s child to her. When the accused-appellant learned that complainant wanted her daughter back after five (5) long years of apparent wanton neglect, they tried their best to help herein complainant find the child as the latter was no longer under the clinic\u2019s care. Accused-appellant Dr. Ty did not have the address of Arabella\u2019s guardians but as soon as she obtained it from Dr. Fe Mallonga who was already working abroad, she personally went to the guardians\u2019 residence and informed them that herein complainant wanted her daughter back. Dr. Ty testified as follows: Q: Now, since you said a while ago that when you placed the child under the (sic) guardianship, you are (sic) aware that the natural mother will get back the child, why did you not return the minor to the natural mother?A: During that time mam, the resident physician who will (sic) discharged the baby was not present because she was abroad.Q: But then madam witness, are you aware where the child was and to whom it was given?A: The exact address was not given to me, mam, before the resident physician left for abroad so, I asked the PAO to give me one month to have (sic) a long distance call to this doctor and asked her for the whereabout(s) of the child.Q: And where you granted the thirty-day period by the Officer of the PAO?A: Yes, mam.Q: What happened if any during that thirty-day period? A: I was able to talk to Fe Mallonga in Bahrain and she told me the exact address of the guardian, mam. Q: Were (sic) you informed (of) the exact address of the guardian, did you informed (sic) the PAO?A: Yes, mam.ATTY. WARD:Q: Then, what happened next, madam witness?A: I was the one who went to the address to be sure that the child was really there, mam.Q: And did you see the child?A: Yes, mam.Q: What did you do with the child?A: I just tell (sic) the child. \u2018Ay and laki mo na pala.\u2019 I just told the child like that and I\u2019ve (sic) talked also to the guardian during that time, mam.Q: And what did you tell the guardian?A: I told the guardian that the rightful mother was claiming for the child and that we should talked (sic) with each other at the PAO for the decision, mam.Q: Did the guardian bring the child to the PAO\u2019s Office (sic)?A: No mam, she did not appear. Q: Why? A: They told me first that they are (sic) going to contact a lawyer but for (sic) several days, she did not respond anymore, mam.[15]When the guardians refused to return the child, accused-appellant Dr. Ty sought the assistance of the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) which conducted a conference among the parties but since a case was yet to be filed, the custody of the minor remained with the guardians. This fact is evident from the following testimony, thus:Q: You testified on cross-examination that you located the whereabouts of the child sometime later, what steps did you take up (sic) after you found the child? A: I explained to the guardian that the verbal agreement between the supposed to be guardianship was only a plain guardianship and not as an adoption, sir.Q: You said you went to the NBI after you found the child, why did you go to the NBI?A: Because the guardian are (sic) not willing to surrender the child to the PAO\u2019s Office (sic). that is why I asked their help, sir.[16]x x x x x x x x x Q: Now, when you informed the present custodian that the natural mother is now claiming the child, why were you not able to get the minor?A: I was not able to get the minor so I asked the help of the NBI to have the child surrender (sic), mam.ATTY. WARD:Q: And what happened when you get (sic) the assistance of the NBI?A: They were the ones who asked the guardian to surrender the child, mam.Q: You stated a while ago that there was no written agreement between you or your hospital and the guardian of the minor, is that correct?A: Yes, mam.Q: For what reason if you know, why (did) the guardian did (sic) not follow you or obey you when you want (sic) to get back the child?A: I don\u2019t know of any reason, mam.[17]The efforts taken by the accused-appellants to help the complainant in finding the child clearly negate the finding that there was a deliberate refusal or failure on their part to restore the child to her mother. Evidence is simply wanting in this regard.It is worthy to note that accused-appellants\u2019 conduct from the moment the child was left in the clinic\u2019s care up to the time the child was given up for guardianship was motivated by nothing more than an earnest desire to help the child and a high regard for her welfare and well-being.WHEREFORE, premises considered, the decision appealed from is hereby REVERSED and SET ASIDE. Accordingly, accused-appellant VICENTE TY and CARMEN TY are hereby ACQUITTED of the crime charged and are ordered to be released immediately unless they are being detained for other lawful causes.

[1]\n\nBoth accused were arrested, and then arraigned on October 27, 1992 when they pleaded not guilty to the crime charged.\n\nAfter trial, on May 31, 1995, a decision was rendered by the Regional Trial Court of Kalookan City, Branch 123, the decretal portion of which disposes as follows:\n\nWHEREFORE, this Court finds both accused Spouses Vicente Ty and Carmen Ty guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of kidnapping a minor and failure to return the same as defined and penalized by Article 270 of the Revised Penal Code and hereby sentences them to suffer imprisonment of reclusion perpetua . The accused are hereby ordered to pay the private complainant the sum of P100,000.00 by way of moral damages caused by anxiety, by her being emotionally drained coupled by the fact that up to this date she could not determine the whereabouts of her child Arabella Sombong.\n\nSO ORDERED. [2]\n\nThe accused now interposes this appeal alleging the ensuing assignment of errors, viz:\n\nI\n\nTHE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN FINDING THAT APPELLANTS \u2018DELIBERATELY FAILED TO RESTORE THE CHILD TO HER MOTHER,\u2019 AND CONVICTING THEM UNDER ART. 270 OF THE REVISED PENAL CODE, AND SENTENCING THEM TO \u2018RECLUSION PERPETUA\u2019;\n\nII\n\nTHE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN NOT HOLDING THAT THE CRIME COMMITTED, IF ANY, IS THAT DEFINED AND PENALIZED UNDER ART. 227 OF THE REVISED PENAL CODE;\n\nIII\n\nTHE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN NOT RECOMMENDING EXECUTIVE CLEMENCY PURSUANT TO PRECEDENT IN \u2018PEOPLE vs. GUTIERREZ,\u2019 197 SCRA 569; and\n\nIV\n\nTHE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN AWARDING \u2018COMPLAINANT THE SUM OF P100,000.00 BY WAY OF MORAL DAMAGES.\u2019 [3]\n\nThe relevant antecedents surrounding the case are as follows:\n\nOn November 18, 1987, complainant Johanna Sombong brought her sick daughter Arabella, then only seven (7) months old, for treatment to the Sir John Medical and Maternity Clinic located at No. 121 First Avenue, Grace Park, Kalookan City which was owned and operated by the accused-appellants. Arabella was diagnosed to be suffering bronchitis and diarrhea, thus complainant was advised to confine the child at the clinic for speedy recovery. About three (3) days later, Arabella was well and was ready to be discharged but complainant was not around to take her home. A week later, complainant came back but did not have enough money to pay the hospital bill in the amount of P300.00. Complainant likewise confided to accused-appellant Dr. Carmen Ty that no one would take care of the child at home as she was working. She then inquired about the rate of the nursery and upon being told that the same was P50.00 per day, she decided to leave her child to the care of the clinic nursery. Consequently, Arabella was transferred from the ward to the nursery. [4]\n\nThereafter, hospital bills started to mount and accumulate. It was at this time that accused-appellant Dr. Ty suggested to the complainant that she hire a \u201cyaya\u201d for P400.00 instead of the daily nursery fee of P50.00. Complainant agreed, hence, a \u201cyaya\u201d was hired. Arabella was then again transferred from the nursery to the extension of the clinic which served as residence for the hospital staff. [5]\n\nFrom then on, nothing was heard of the complainant. She neither visited her child nor called to inquire about her whereabouts. Her estranged husband came to the clinic once but did not get the child. Efforts to get in touch with the complainant were unsuccessful as she left no address or telephone number where she can be reached. This development prompted Dr. Ty to notify the barangay captain of the child\u2019s abandonment. [6] Eventually, the hospital staff took turns in taking care of Arabella. [7]\n\nSometime in 1989, two (2) years after Arabella was abandoned by complainant, Dr. Fe Mallonga, a dentist at the clinic, suggested during a hospital staff conference that Arabella be entrusted to a guardian who could give the child the love and affection, personal attention and caring she badly needed as she was thin and sickly. The suggestion was favorably considered, hence, Dr. Mallonga gave the child to her aunt, Lilibeth Neri. [8]\n\nIn 1992, complainant came back to claim the daughter she abandoned some five (5) years back.\n\nWhen her pleas allegedly went unanswered, she filed a petition for habeas corpus against accused-appellants with the Regional Trial Court of Quezon City. Said petition was however denied due course and was summarily dismissed without prejudice on the ground of lack of jurisdiction, the alleged detention having been perpetrated in Kalookan City.\n\nThereafter, the instant criminal case was filed against accused-appellants.\n\nComplainant likewise filed an administrative case for dishonorable conduct against accused-appellant Dr. Carmen Ty before the Board of Medicine of the Professional Regulation Commission. This case was subsequently dismissed for failure to prosecute.\n\nOn October 13, 1992, complainant filed a petition for habeas corpus with the Regional Trial Court of Quezon City, this time against the alleged guardians of her daughter, namely, Marietta Neri Alviar and Lilibeth Neri. On January 15, 1993, the trial court rendered a decision granting the petition and ordering the guardians to immediately deliver the person of Cristina Grace Neri to the complainant, the court having found Cristina to be the complainant\u2019s child. On appeal to the Court of Appeals, however, said decision was reversed on the ground that the guardians were not unlawfully withholding from the complainant the rightful custody of Cristina after finding that Cristina and complainant\u2019s daughter are not one and the same person. On January 31, 1996, this Court in Sombong v. Court of Appeals [9] affirmed the Court of Appeals\u2019 decision.\n\nIn this appeal, accused-appellants would want us to take a second look and resolve the issue of whether or not they are guilty of kidnapping and failure to return a minor. Accused-appellants of course contend that they are not guilty and the Solicitor General agrees. In its Manifestations and Motion in lieu of Appellee\u2019s Brief, the Office of the Solicitor General recommends their acquittal.\n\nWe agree.\n\nAs we have mentioned above, this Court in Sombong v. Court of Appeals [10] affirmed the decision of the Court of Appeals reversing the trial court\u2019s ruling that complainant has rightful custody over the child, Cristina Grace Neri, the latter not being identical with complainant\u2019s daughter, Arabella. The Court discoursed, thusly:\n\nPetitioner does not have the right of custody over the minor Cristina because, by the evidence disclosed before the court a quo , Cristina has not been shown to be petitioner\u2019s daughter, Arabella. The evidence adduced before the trial court does not warrant the conclusion that Arabella is the same person as Cristina.\n\n[TABLE_CONTENT]\nx x x | | x x x | | x x x\n[END_TABLE]\n\nx x x x x x x x x\n\nIn the instant case, the testimonial and circumstantial proof establishes the individual and separate existence of petitioner\u2019s child, Arabella, from that of private respondents\u2019 foster child, Cristina.\n\nWe note, among others, that Dr. Trono, who is petitioner\u2019s own witness, testified in court that, together with Arabella, there were several babies left in the clinic and so she could not be certain whether it was Arabella or some their baby that was given to private respondents. Petitioner\u2019s own evidence shows that, after the confinement of Arabella in the clinic in 1987, she saw her daughter again only in 1989 when she visited the clinic. This corroborates the testimony of petitioner\u2019s own witness, Dra. Ty, that Arabella was physically confined in the clinic from November, 1987 to April, 1989. This testimony tallies with her assertion in her counter-affidavit to the effect that Arabella was in the custody of the hospital until April, 1989. All this, when juxtaposed with the unwavering declaration of private respondents that they obtained custody of Cristina in April, 1988 and had her baptized at the Good Samaritan Church on April 30, 1988, leads to the conclusions that Cristina is not Arabella.\n\nSignificantly, Justice Lourdes K. Tayao-Jaguros, herself a mother and the ponente of the herein assailed decision, set the case for hearing on August 30, 1993 primarily for the purpose of observing petitioner\u2019s demeanor towards the minor Cristina. She made the following personal but relevant manifestation:\n\nThe undersigned ponente as a mother herself of four children, wanted to see how petitioner as an alleged mother of a missing child supposedly in the person of Cristina Neri would react on seeing again her long lost child. The petitioner appeared in the scheduled hearing of this case late, and she walked inside the courtroom looking for a seat without even stopping at her alleged daughter\u2019s seat; without even casting a glance on said child, and without even that tearful embrace which characterizes the reunion of a loving mother with her missing dear child. Throughout the proceedings, the undersigned ponente noticed no signs of endearment and affection expected of a mother who had been deprived of the embrace of her little child for many years. The conclusion or finding of undersigned ponente as a mother, herself, that petitioner-appellee is not the mother of Cristina Neri has been given support by aforestated observation xxx.\n\n[TABLE_CONTENT]\nx x x | | x x x | | x x x\n[END_TABLE]\n\nx x x x x x x x x\n\nSince we hold that petitioner has not been established by evidence to be entitled to the custody of the minor Cristina on account of mistaken identity, it cannot be said that private respondents are unlawfully withholding from petitioner the rightful custody over Cristina. At this juncture, we need not inquire into the validity of the mode by which private respondents acquired custodial rights over the minor, Cristina.\n\n[TABLE_CONTENT]\nx x x | | x x x | | x x x\n[END_TABLE]\n\nx x x x x x x x x\n\nUnder the facts and ruling in Sombong , as well as the evidence adduced in this case accused-appellants must perforce be acquitted of the crime charged, there being no reason to hold them liable for failing to return one Cristina Grace Neri, a child not conclusively shown and established to be complainant\u2019s daugther, Arabella.\n\nThe foregoing notwithstanding, even if we were to consider Cristina Grace Neri and Arabella Sombong as one and the same person, still, the instant criminal case against the accused-appellants must fall.\n\nBefore a conviction for kidnapping and failure to return a minor under Article 270 of the Revised Penal Code can be had, two elements must concur, namely: (a) the offender has been entrusted with the custody of the minor, and (b) the offender deliberately fails to restore said minor to his parents or guardians. The essential element herein is that the offender is entrusted with the custody of the minor but what is actually punishable is not the kidnapping of the minor, as the title of the article seems to indicate, but rather the deliberate failure or refusal of the custodian of the minor to restore the latter to his parents or guardians. [11] Said failure or refusal, however, must not only be deliberate but must also be persistent as to oblige the parents or the guardians of the child to seek the aid of the courts in order to obtain custody. [12] The key word therefore of this element is deliberate and Black\u2019s Law Dictionary defines deliberate as:\n\nDeliberate, adj. Well advised; carefully considered; not sudden or rash; circumspect; slow in determining. Willful rather than merely intentional. Formed, arrived at, or determined upon as a result of careful thought and weighing of considerations, as a deliberate judgment or plan. Carried on coolly and steadily, especially according to a preconceived design; given to weighing facts and arguments with a view to a choice or decision; careful in considering the consequences of a step; slow in action; unhurried; characterized by reflection; dispassionate; not rash. People v. Thomas, 25 Cal. 2d 880, 156 P. 2d 7, 17, 18.\n\nBy the use of this word, in describing a crime, the idea is conveyed that the perpetrator weighs the motives for the act and its consequences, the nature of the crime, or other things connected with his intentions, with a view to a decision thereon; that he carefully considers all these, and that the act is not suddenly committed. It implies that the perpetrator must be capable of the exercise of such mental powers as are called into use by deliberation and the consideration and weighing of motives and consequences. [13]\n\nSimilarly, the word deliberate is defined in Corpus Juris Secundum as:\n\nDELIBERATE.\n\nAs a Verb\n\nThe word is derived from two Latin words which mean literally \u2018concerning\u2019 and \u2018to weigh,\u2019 it implies the possession of a mind capable of conceiving a purpose to act, and the exercise of such mental powers as are called into use by the consideration and weighing of the motives and the consequences of the act; and has been defined as meaning to consider, reflect, take counsel, or to weigh the arguments for and against a proposed course of action; to consider and examine the reasons for and against, consider maturely, ponder, reflect upon, or weigh in the mind; to reflect, with a view to make a choice; to weigh the motives for an act and its consequences, with a view to a decision thereon.\n\nAs an Adjective\n\nThe word, used adjectively, implies action after thought and reflection, and relates to the end proposed; indicates a purpose formed in a mind capable of conceiving a purpose; and is based upon an intention accompanied by such circumstances as evidence a mind fully conscious of its own purpose and design. It has been defined as meaning carefully considered; circumspect; entered upon after deliberation and with fixed purpose, formed after careful consideration, and fully or carefully considering the nature or consequences of an act or measure; maturely reflected; not sudden or rash, carefully considering the probable consequences of a step; premeditated; slow in determining; weighing facts and arguments with a view to a choice of decision; well-advised.\n\nUnder some circumstances, it has been held synonymous with, or equivalent to, \u2018intentional,\u2019 \u2018premeditated,\u2019 and \u2018willful.\u2019\n\nUnder other circumstances, however, it has been compared with, or distinguished from, \u2018premeditated,\u2019 \u2018sudden,\u2019 and \u2018willful.\u2019 [14]\n\nEssentially, the word deliberate as used in the article must imply something more than mere negligence; it must be premeditated, obstinate, headstrong, foolishly daring or intentionally and maliciously wrong.\n\nIn the case at bar, it is evident that there was no deliberate refusal or failure on the part of the accused-appellants to restore the custody of the complainant\u2019s child to her. When the accused-appellant learned that complainant wanted her daughter back after five (5) long years of apparent wanton neglect, they tried their best to help herein complainant find the child as the latter was no longer under the clinic\u2019s care. Accused-appellant Dr. Ty did not have the address of Arabella\u2019s guardians but as soon as she obtained it from Dr. Fe Mallonga who was already working abroad, she personally went to the guardians\u2019 residence and informed them that herein complainant wanted her daughter back. Dr. Ty testified as follows:\n\n[TABLE_CONTENT]\nQ: | Now, since you said a while ago that when you placed the child under the (sic) guardianship, you are (sic) aware that the natural mother will get back the child, why did you not return the minor to the natural mother?\n | \nA: | During that time mam, the resident physician who will (sic) discharged the baby was not present because she was abroad.\n | \nQ: | But then madam witness, are you aware where the child was and to whom it was given?\n | \nA: | The exact address was not given to me, mam, before the resident physician left for abroad so, I asked the PAO to give me one month to have (sic) a long distance call to this doctor and asked her for the whereabout(s) of the child.\n | \nQ: | And where you granted the thirty-day period by the Officer of the PAO?\n | \nA: | Yes, mam.\n | \nQ: | What happened if any during that thirty-day period?\n | \nA: | I was able to talk to Fe Mallonga in Bahrain and she told me the exact address of the guardian, mam.\n | \nQ: | Were (sic) you informed (of) the exact address of the guardian, did you informed (sic) the PAO?\n | \nA: | Yes, mam.\n | \nATTY.

Q: But then madam witness, are you aware where the child was and to whom it was given? A: The exact address was not given to me, mam, before the resident physician left for abroad so, I asked the PAO to give me one month to have (sic) a long distance call to this doctor and asked her for the whereabout(s) of the child. Q: And where you granted the thirty-day period by the Officer of the PAO? A: Yes, mam. Q: What happened if any during that thirty-day period? A: I was able to talk to Fe Mallonga in Bahrain and she told me the exact address of the guardian, mam. Q: Were (sic) you informed (of) the exact address of the guardian, did you informed (sic) the PAO? A: Yes, mam. ATTY. WARD: Q: Then, what happened next, madam witness? A: I was the one who went to the address to be sure that the child was really there, mam. Q: And did you see the child? A: Yes, mam. Q: What did you do with the child? A: I just tell (sic) the child. \u2018Ay and laki mo na pala.\u2019 I just told the child like that and I\u2019ve (sic) talked also to the guardian during that time, mam. Q: And what did you tell the guardian? A: I told the guardian that the rightful mother was claiming for the child and that we should talked (sic) with each other at the PAO for the decision, mam.

A: They told me first that they are (sic) going to contact a lawyer but for (sic) several days, she did not respond anymore, mam. [15]\n\nWhen the guardians refused to return the child, accused-appellant Dr. Ty sought the assistance of the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) which conducted a conference among the parties but since a case was yet to be filed, the custody of the minor remained with the guardians. This fact is evident from the following testimony, thus:\n\n[TABLE_CONTENT]\nQ: | You testified on cross-examination that you located the whereabouts of the child sometime later, what steps did you take up (sic) after you found the child?\n | \nA: | I explained to the guardian that the verbal agreement between the supposed to be guardianship was only a plain guardianship and not as an adoption, sir.\n | \nQ: | You said you went to the NBI after you found the child, why did you go to the NBI?\n | \nA: | Because the guardian are (sic) not willing to surrender the child to the PAO\u2019s Office (sic). that is why I asked their help, sir.[16]\n[END_TABLE]\n\nQ: You testified on cross-examination that you located the whereabouts of the child sometime later, what steps did you take up (sic) after you found the child? A: I explained to the guardian that the verbal agreement between the supposed to be guardianship was only a plain guardianship and not as an adoption, sir. Q: You said you went to the NBI after you found the child, why did you go to the NBI? A: Because the guardian are (sic) not willing to surrender the child to the PAO\u2019s Office (sic). that is why I asked their help, sir.

[17]\n\nThe efforts taken by the accused-appellants to help the complainant in finding the child clearly negate the finding that there was a deliberate refusal or failure on their part to restore the child to her mother. Evidence is simply wanting in this regard.\n\nIt is worthy to note that accused-appellants\u2019 conduct from the moment the child was left in the clinic\u2019s care up to the time the child was given up for guardianship was motivated by nothing more than an earnest desire to help the child and a high regard for her welfare and well-being.\n\nWHEREFORE, premises considered, the decision appealed from is hereby REVERSED and SET ASIDE. Accordingly, accused-appellant VICENTE TY and CARMEN TY are hereby ACQUITTED of the crime charged and are ordered to be released immediately unless they are being detained for other lawful causes.

      "title": "PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, PLAINTIFF-APPELLEE, VS. LINDES PAYNOR, ACCUSED-APPELLANT. D E C I S I O N REGALADO, J.: For the fatal stabbing of Carmelita Aguinaldo at Barangay Rizal, Roxas, Isabela, herein accused-appellant Lindes Paynor, alias \u201cJess,\u201d was charged with the crime of murder in Criminal Case No. 23-285 of Branch 23, Regional Trial Court of Roxas, Isabela.The factual backdrop of this tragic occurrence, culled from the records of the trial court and the testimonies adduced therein, commenced at around 4:00 P.M. of September 18, 1991 when a middle-aged teacher, Carmelita Aguinaldo, was stabbed and killed inside her classroom at the Roxas Central Elementary School. A ten-year old pupil, by the name of Fresnaida Magaway, narrated how the events unfolded.She testified that in the afternoon of September 18, 1991 she was assigned as a cleaner and, while sweeping the ground near her classroom, she noticed a man who was holding a pointed knife, near the classroom of the victim. The man entered the room of the teacher, stabbed her, and went out of the room headed west towards the fence of the school, carrying the pointed bladed weapon in his hand and passing in front of the witness. Shortly thereafter, Ms. Aguinaldo emerged from the room saying \u201cManang, nabagsol na kon,\u201d literally meaning, \u201cManang, I am stabbed,\u201d then she fell to the ground.[1]The immediate reaction of this young witness was to seek help from her teachers, so she went into the classroom of her teacher, Ms. Hermogena Uy, and told her about Ms. Aguinaldo. She then took her belongings from the classroom and proceeded immediately to where Ms. Aguinaldo fell down and there she saw Mrs. Leticia Navarro embracing the victim, with Mrs. Elizabeth Dumlao by their side. A tricycle came and the teachers rushed the victim to the nearby hospital. She followed her teachers to the hospital, where Ms. Aguinaldo was pronounced dead on arrival.Fernando Castillo, a policeman, who had responded to the crime report, testified that he went to the hospital and inquired whether someone saw the stabbing. According to him, Fresnaida Magaway came forward and told them that she saw a man in blue maong pants, and white T-shirt printed in front, using slippers and a brown hat, and with a green towel wrapped around his neck. He entered the school yard and went to the room of Ms. Aguinaldo where he stabbed her with a pointed bladed weapon. She further said that if the man would be presented to her, she could recognize him.[2]The police investigators then went to the house of the family of the deceased and asked the family members if they had a suspect in the killing of Ms. Aguinaldo. The family of the deceased pointed to appellant, the \u201cjilted boyfriend\u201d of the victim\u2019s sister, as a possible suspect. The policemen then proceeded to the house of appellant, but they were informed that he was at the Tagalag auto repair shop having his motorcycle repaired.[3]At the Tagalag auto repair shop, the policemen saw appellant wearing maong pants, white T-shirt with markings in front, with a yellow towel wrapped around his neck and a brown hat on his head. Appellant was invited by them to their station where he was identified by Fresnaida Magaway as the person who stabbed and killed Ms. Aguinaldo. On the strength of said positive identification, appellant was detained at the police station.An information was filed on September 19, 1991, charging appellant with the murder of Carmelita Aguinaldo, with evident premeditation and treachery as attendant circumstances, by the infliction of a fatal stab wound on her chest, and committed at the time and on the date and place earlier narrated.[4]No preliminary investigation having been conducted prior to the filling of that information, appellant\u2019s counsel filed a motion for preliminary investigation on September 23, 1991 with the Regional Trial Court, Branch 16, at Ilagan, Isabela. On October 18, 1991, presiding Judge Teodulo E. Mirasol issued an order directing the Provincial Prosecutor to conduct a preliminary investigation.Denying appellant\u2019s motion for his release from detention in the meantime, said court issued an order on November 8, 1991 that \u2014 \u201cx x x the court is of the opinion that the arrest is lawful, considering that the accused was arrested immediately after the commission of the offense, the police officers acting with promptness after a credible information furnished them by a credible witness. That the police acted with personal knowledge of facts fed them by a witness who has no sufficient time to reflect on what she was going to tell the police (is) indicative of truthfulness in pointing to the accused as the author of the stabbing.\u201d[5]On November 22, 1991, a resolution was issued by the Office of the Provincial Prosecutor maintaining the information filed on September 19, 1991. On December 12, 1991, appellant was duly arraigned and, on his plea of not guilty to the charge for murder the court below thereafter proceeded with the trial.The prosecution based its case primarily on the testimony of a lone eyewitness, and this in the person of a ten-year old girl, Fresnaida Magaway. Considering that doubts may be entertained in view of her tender years, and for a graphic illustration and clearer appreciation of what actually transpired on the afternoon of 18 September 1991 as seen through the eyes of this eyewitness, we quote the pertinent transcripts of stenographic notes of her testimony:\u201cQ Do you know the name of that man whom you pointed to the court?A Yes, sir.Q Will you please tell his name if you know?A Jessie Paynor, sir.Q Can you recall the attire and appearance of the accused whom you pointed to when he stabbed Ms. Aguinaldo in her room on September 18, 1991, at 4:00 o\u2019clock in the afternoon?A He ha(d) a white t-shirt, denim pants and he ha(d) a woven hat and a green towel. (The witness demonstrating as if the towel was wrapped around her neck)[6]x x x x x x x x x Q Did you not tell Mrs. Uy that you saw the man who stabbed Mrs. Aguinaldo?A I told her sir, but I did not tell the name.Q Do you know the name of the person at the time you told Mrs. Uy the identity of the assailant?A Jessie, sir.Q Yes, did you mention the name of Jessie to Mrs. Uy when you told Mrs. Uy that you saw the stabbing of Mrs. Aguinaldo?A No sir.Q Can you tell this court why you failed to inform Mrs. Uy your teacher, the identity of the assailant?A I did not tell her sir because I followed Mrs. Aguinaldo.Q You did not tell her or you failed to tell her because you immediately followed where Mrs. Aguinaldo was brought to, is that what you mean?A Yes, sir.Q Now, that person whom you identified as Jess, from the way you testify, you already know him, is that correct, at the time of the stabbing?A Yes, sir.[7]x x x x x x x x x Q Now how did you notice if it is true that you recognized for the third time that he was walking to and fro in front of your room and the room of Mrs. Aguinaldo the identity of the assailant of Mrs. Aguinaldo?A Because he was walking to and fro my attention was attracted.Q So when the third time that you noticed him walking to and fro, could you tell the court what special feature of that person walking to and fro attracted your attention?A I saw the face, sir.Q Is that the only thing that you saw in that person, his face?A I saw the apparel, sir.Q And it was at the fourth time that he walked to and fro when he entered the room of Mrs. Aguinaldo?A Yes, sir.Q And during that time he was walking to and fro you already saw him holding a knife, is that correct?A Not yet, sir.Q At what point in time did you see him if you saw him h(o)ld a knife?A I did not yet see the knife he used to stab Mrs. Aguinaldo, sir.COURT:Q Yes, did you see any knife in his possession during or after the incident?A After Mrs. Aguinaldo was stabbed I saw him holding the knife because he was facing me at that time.Q So that was the only time that you saw him, I mean the assailant, holding a knife when he passed by you?A Yes, sir.Q And when the assailant came out of the room of Mrs. Aguinaldo how did he leave the room, he ran, he walk(ed), or what? A After ma\u2019am Aguinaldo was stabbed the assailant ran away, sir.[8]As earlier stated, both in the police station and then in open court, the young girl positively identified appellant as the person she saw on September 18, 1991 who stabbed and killed the victim, Mrs. Carmelita Aguinaldo.Appellant denied having been anywhere near the school on September 18, 1991 and insisted that he was at the Tagalag auto repair shop, busy having his motorcycle repaired. Testifying in his defense, appellant blandly declared that he went to the repair shop at 2:10 in the afternoon of that day, to have his motorcycle repaired; that he had to push his motorcycle to the shop and when they tested it there, it would not start; that the owner suggested and he agreed that the engine be overhauled; that he was at that shop all the time, helping in the overhauling until 5:00 P.M. when policemen arrived and invited him to go with them to the police station.[9]The testimony of appellant was corroborated by Cecilio Tagalag who testified that the former was at their motor shop from 2:00 to 5:00 p.m. on September 18, 1991 and left only when he was picked up by the police authorities at around 5:00 o\u2019clock that afternoon.[10]The trial court rendered judgment on April 21, l994, finding against appellant and commending the lone eyewitness for the prosecution, Fresnaida Magaway. These words of said court therein are worth repeating, before the dispositive portion that follows:\u201cCross examined on several occasions, this young girl stuc(k) to the testimony that it was the accused whom she saw enter the room, then left followed by the victim shouting for help. During these gruelling and excruciating cross-examinations, she never faltered. She never showed any sign of fear. She never wavered, she stuc(k) to her testimony.This girl is no ordinary girl. She is made of metal far better than some adults. For adults are always mindful of their safety and their families. Even if they have actually seen a person shot to death, stabbed to death, or mauled to death, they would not come out in the open and volunteer the information that they saw the killing. Either they keep quiet, or deny having witnessed such incident. But this girl is different. She volunteered to describe the attire of the accused. x x x x x x x x x If only witnesses who see actual killings, have the guts and the courage of this girl, all unsolved criminal cases would be solved. This girl shames the adults, especially those who do not come out (in) the open when they witness crimes. If only those witnesses were Fresnaida Magaway, all crimes would have been solved, and the malefactors sent to jail. This girl is an epitome of courage and guts. Fearless and intelligent, she has done what adults shu(n) to do.[11] x x x x x x x x x AS A CONSEQUENCE OF ALL THE FOREGOING, the court finds the accused guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of murder provided for and penalized by article 248 of the Revised Penal Code, and imposes upon him the penalty of Reclusion Perpetua, together with all the necessary penalties provided by law, to indemnify the heirs of the victim in the amount of P50,000.00 pesos, without however, subsidiary imprisonment in case of insolvency, and to pay cost.\u201d[12]Appellant now seeks the reversal of that verdict, claiming that the trial court erred: (1) in giving credence to the testimony of Fresnaida Magaway in convicting him in spite of the material flaws, contradictions, and improbabilities inherent in her testimony; (2) in admitting in evidence the following physical evidence: white T-shirt, denim pants, green towel, and hat, in spite of the clear violation of the Miranda doctrine during the custodial investigation of the accused; (3) in convicting him based on mere circumstantial evidence from an account of one highly questionable witness; and (4) in convicting him of the offense charged despite failure of the prosecution to prove the qualifying circumstances of treachery and evident premeditation.[13]Appellant specifically laments the mode by which Fresnaida Magaway identified him, theorizing that if the witness really knew him, she should have mentioned his name the moment she was asked by the police as to who stabbed the victim, instead of resorting to a \u201cdescriptive identification.\u201d[14]He likewise also argues that there was a violation of the Miranda rights of an accused when he was identified by the witness while he was seated on a bench of the investigation room. The manner employed by the investigators in obtaining his T-shirt, pants, towel, slippers, and hat, according to appellant, was a further violation of his rights as these items were taken from him in the absence of his counsel.The defense also asserts that the lower court relied upon the testimony of a highly questionable witness in the person of Fresnaida Magaway, and that the conviction of appellant was based purely on circumstantial evidence which should not have been taken as proof beyond reasonable doubt that he really stabbed the victim to death. The final contention is that the prosecution failed to prove either that there was treachery employed by the accused in the killing of the victim or that there was evident premeditation on his part to take her life.On the allegation of inconsistency and flaws in the testimony of a single eyewitness, a thorough review of the transcripts of stenographic notes, particularly those on the testimony of witness Fresnaida Magaway, does not reveal any major inconsistency. Instead, the Court is regaled by the unswerving and consistent position of the witness that appellant was the only one whom she saw on that occasion and that he stabbed and killed her teacher, Mrs. Aguinaldo. Any minor lapses therein tend to buttress, rather than weaken, her credibility since they show that she was neither coached nor were her answers contrived.[15]The contention of appellant that the expected reaction of the witness should have been to identify him by name is an obvious non sequitur. What should be considered as a general or common rule is that witnesses to a crime react in different ways. In the instant case, the youthful witness was unable to immediately reveal the name of appellant to the police as she was evidently scared or confused and, as she explained, she also failed to name appellant at that time since her concern and thoughts were of her teacher whom she followed to the hospital. Surely, we can not fault the young girl for her confusion and fear, it being her first time to witness such a crime of violence.The important thing is that when she testified at the trial, she was firm, spontaneous and categorical in her declaration that it was appellant whom she saw that afternoon, and that it was he who entered the classroom of her teacher and stabbed the latter with a pointed bladed weapon. The witness stood by her declaration, unshaken throughout the entire trial, and never showed any hesitation in her testimony.Another fact worth stressing is that the witness had no motive whatsoever to fabricate a serious charge against appellant. When there is no showing that the principal witness for the prosecution was actuated by an improper motive, the presumption is that he was not so actuated, and his testimony is thus entitled to full faith and credit.[16]Appellant then asseverates that there was a violation of his rights while under custodial investigation, in light of the Miranda doctrine, when allegedly the police investigators unceremoniously stripped him of his clothing and personal items, and the same were later introduced as evidence during the trial. The Court is not persuaded. The protection of the accused under custodial investigation, which is invoked by appellant, refers to testimonial compulsion. Section 12, Article III of the Constitution provides that such accused shall have the right to be informed of his right to remain silent, the right to counsel, and the right to waive the right to counsel in the presence of counsel, and that any confession or admission obtained in violation of his rights shall be inadmissible in evidence against him. As held in People vs. Gamboa,[17] this constitutional right applies only against testimonial compulsion and not when the body of the accused is proposed to be examined. In fact, an accused may validly be compelled to be photographed or measured, or his garments or shoes removed or replaced, or to move his body to enable the foregoing things to be done, without running afoul of the proscription against testimonial compulsion.[18]The desperate ploy of appellant that the evidence against him was purely circumstantial does not even warrant refutation. It was definitely established by the prosecution that appellant was actually the one who treacherously attacked the victim. Eyewitness Magaway unequivocally stated and lucidly described how she saw appellant actually stabbing Mrs. Aguinaldo,[19] and even demonstrated during the ocular inspection the specific part of the room where the crime was committed and where she herself was when she witnessed the dastardly deed.[20] As already explained, the defense failed to show that the witness had ill motives in testifying against appellant and there is no doubt in the mind of this Court that the witness really had no personal ill feelings against him. The conclusion that irresistibly emerges, therefore, is that the witness was just honestly relating what she really saw on September 18, 1991, and that she so testified because of her desire for justice and redress for the terrible wrong against her teacher.The fourth error assigned by appellant that evident premeditation and treachery were not proved merits some comment. It is correct that evident premeditation was not established. There is no evidence or showing on record when and how appellant planned and prepared for the killing of the victim. His allegation that there was no treachery, however, is a different matter. The attack against Mrs. Aguinaldo was so sudden that, although she was stabbed by appellant while she was facing him, the unexpected attack in itself constituted treachery. The victim was caught unaware and did not have any opportunity to defend herself. Also, from the means and methods adopted by appellant to commit the crime, it would be incredible to assume that the same were not deliberately adopted to insure the consummation of the felony.Lastly, there can be no sensible debate that appellant\u2019s defense of alibi has to be rejected. It is elementary that for this discredited defense, credible and tangible proof of physical impossibility for the accused to be at the scene of the crime is indispensable.[21] In the present case, the court below found that appellant was then just one kilometer away from the scene of the crime.[22] Furthermore, the defense of alibi can not prevail over the positive identification of the accused by an eyewitness who had no improper motive to falsely testify.[23]WHEREFORE, the judgment appealed from is hereby affirmed in toto, with costs against accused-appellant Lindes Paynor.SO ORDERED.Romero, Puno, Mendoza and Torres, Jr., JJ., concur.[1] TSN, December 12, 1991, 10-15.[2] Ibid., October 15, 1992, 4-5.[3] Ibid., id., 7-8.3[4] Original Record, 1.[5] Ibid., 28.[6] Ibid., December 12, 1991, 14-15.[7] Ibid., December 18, 1991, 77-80.[8] Ibid., June 11, l992, 9-11.[9] Ibid., April 14, l993, 4-6.[10] Ibid., March 10, l993, 4.[11] Original Record, 250-251.[12] Ibid., 256; per Judge Wilfredo Tumaliuan.[13] Rollo, 89; Brief for Accused-Appellant, 3.[14] Ibid., 89-90.[15] People vs. Querido, G.R.

LINDES PAYNOR, ACCUSED-APPELLANT.\n\nD E C I S I O N\n\nREGALADO, J.:\n\nFor the fatal stabbing of Carmelita Aguinaldo at Barangay Rizal, Roxas, Isabela, herein accused-appellant Lindes Paynor, alias \u201cJess,\u201d was charged with the crime of murder in Criminal Case No. 23-285 of Branch 23, Regional Trial Court of Roxas, Isabela.\n\nThe factual backdrop of this tragic occurrence, culled from the records of the trial court and the testimonies adduced therein, commenced at around 4:00 P.M. of September 18, 1991 when a middle-aged teacher, Carmelita Aguinaldo, was stabbed and killed inside her classroom at the Roxas Central Elementary School. A ten-year old pupil, by the name of Fresnaida Magaway, narrated how the events unfolded.\n\nShe testified that in the afternoon of September 18, 1991 she was assigned as a cleaner and, while sweeping the ground near her classroom, she noticed a man who was holding a pointed knife, near the classroom of the victim. The man entered the room of the teacher, stabbed her, and went out of the room headed west towards the fence of the school, carrying the pointed bladed weapon in his hand and passing in front of the witness. Shortly thereafter, Ms. Aguinaldo emerged from the room saying \u201cManang, nabagsol na kon,\u201d literally meaning, \u201cManang, I am stabbed,\u201d then she fell to the ground. [1]\n\nThe immediate reaction of this young witness was to seek help from her teachers, so she went into the classroom of her teacher, Ms. Hermogena Uy, and told her about Ms. Aguinaldo. She then took her belongings from the classroom and proceeded immediately to where Ms. Aguinaldo fell down and there she saw Mrs. Leticia Navarro embracing the victim, with Mrs. Elizabeth Dumlao by their side. A tricycle came and the teachers rushed the victim to the nearby hospital. She followed her teachers to the hospital, where Ms. Aguinaldo was pronounced dead on arrival.\n\nFernando Castillo, a policeman, who had responded to the crime report, testified that he went to the hospital and inquired whether someone saw the stabbing. According to him, Fresnaida Magaway came forward and told them that she saw a man in blue maong pants, and white T-shirt printed in front, using slippers and a brown hat, and with a green towel wrapped around his neck. He entered the school yard and went to the room of Ms. Aguinaldo where he stabbed her with a pointed bladed weapon. She further said that if the man would be presented to her, she could recognize him. [2]\n\nThe police investigators then went to the house of the family of the deceased and asked the family members if they had a suspect in the killing of Ms. Aguinaldo. The family of the deceased pointed to appellant, the \u201cjilted boyfriend\u201d of the victim\u2019s sister, as a possible suspect. The policemen then proceeded to the house of appellant, but they were informed that he was at the Tagalag auto repair shop having his motorcycle repaired. [3]\n\nAt the Tagalag auto repair shop, the policemen saw appellant wearing maong pants, white T-shirt with markings in front, with a yellow towel wrapped around his neck and a brown hat on his head. Appellant was invited by them to their station where he was identified by Fresnaida Magaway as the person who stabbed and killed Ms. Aguinaldo. On the strength of said positive identification, appellant was detained at the police station.\n\nAn information was filed on September 19, 1991, charging appellant with the murder of Carmelita Aguinaldo, with evident premeditation and treachery as attendant circumstances, by the infliction of a fatal stab wound on her chest, and committed at the time and on the date and place earlier narrated. [4]\n\nNo preliminary investigation having been conducted prior to the filling of that information, appellant\u2019s counsel filed a motion for preliminary investigation on September 23, 1991 with the Regional Trial Court, Branch 16, at Ilagan, Isabela. On October 18, 1991, presiding Judge Teodulo E. Mirasol issued an order directing the Provincial Prosecutor to conduct a preliminary investigation.\n\nDenying appellant\u2019s motion for his release from detention in the meantime, said court issued an order on November 8, 1991 that \u2014\n\n\u201cx x x the court is of the opinion that the arrest is lawful, considering that the accused was arrested immediately after the commission of the offense, the police officers acting with promptness after a credible information furnished them by a credible witness. That the police acted with personal knowledge of facts fed them by a witness who has no sufficient time to reflect on what she was going to tell the police (is) indicative of truthfulness in pointing to the accused as the author of the stabbing.\u201d [5]\n\nOn November 22, 1991, a resolution was issued by the Office of the Provincial Prosecutor maintaining the information filed on September 19, 1991. On December 12, 1991, appellant was duly arraigned and, on his plea of not guilty to the charge for murder the court below thereafter proceeded with the trial.\n\nThe prosecution based its case primarily on the testimony of a lone eyewitness, and this in the person of a ten-year old girl, Fresnaida Magaway.

[8]\n\nAs earlier stated, both in the police station and then in open court, the young girl positively identified appellant as the person she saw on September 18, 1991 who stabbed and killed the victim, Mrs. Carmelita Aguinaldo.\n\nAppellant denied having been anywhere near the school on September 18, 1991 and insisted that he was at the Tagalag auto repair shop, busy having his motorcycle repaired. Testifying in his defense, appellant blandly declared that he went to the repair shop at 2:10 in the afternoon of that day, to have his motorcycle repaired; that he had to push his motorcycle to the shop and when they tested it there, it would not start; that the owner suggested and he agreed that the engine be overhauled; that he was at that shop all the time, helping in the overhauling until 5:00 P.M. when policemen arrived and invited him to go with them to the police station. [9]\n\nThe testimony of appellant was corroborated by Cecilio Tagalag who testified that the former was at their motor shop from 2:00 to 5:00 p.m. on September 18, 1991 and left only when he was picked up by the police authorities at around 5:00 o\u2019clock that afternoon. [10]\n\nThe trial court rendered judgment on April 21, l994, finding against appellant and commending the lone eyewitness for the prosecution, Fresnaida Magaway. These words of said court therein are worth repeating, before the dispositive portion that follows:\n\n\u201cCross examined on several occasions, this young girl stuc(k) to the testimony that it was the accused whom she saw enter the room, then left followed by the victim shouting for help. During these gruelling and excruciating cross-examinations, she never faltered. She never showed any sign of fear. She never wavered, she stuc(k) to her testimony.\n\nThis girl is no ordinary girl. She is made of metal far better than some adults. For adults are always mindful of their safety and their families. Even if they have actually seen a person shot to death, stabbed to death, or mauled to death, they would not come out in the open and volunteer the information that they saw the killing. Either they keep quiet, or deny having witnessed such incident. But this girl is different. She volunteered to describe the attire of the accused.\n\n[TABLE_CONTENT]\nx x x | | x x x | | x x x\n[END_TABLE]\n\nx x x x x x x x x\n\nIf only witnesses who see actual killings, have the guts and the courage of this girl, all unsolved criminal cases would be solved. This girl shames the adults, especially those who do not come out (in) the open when they witness crimes. If only those witnesses were Fresnaida Magaway, all crimes would have been solved, and the malefactors sent to jail. This girl is an epitome of courage and guts. Fearless and intelligent, she has done what adults shu(n) to do. [11]\n\n[TABLE_CONTENT]\nx x x | | x x x | | x x x\n[END_TABLE]\n\nx x x x x x x x x\n\nAS A CONSEQUENCE OF ALL THE FOREGOING, the court finds the accused guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of murder provided for and penalized by article 248 of the Revised Penal Code, and imposes upon him the penalty of Reclusion Perpetua , together with all the necessary penalties provided by law, to indemnify the heirs of the victim in the amount of P50,000.00 pesos, without however, subsidiary imprisonment in case of insolvency, and to pay cost.\u201d [12]\n\nAppellant now seeks the reversal of that verdict, claiming that the trial court erred: (1) in giving credence to the testimony of Fresnaida Magaway in convicting him in spite of the material flaws, contradictions, and improbabilities inherent in her testimony; (2) in admitting in evidence the following physical evidence: white T-shirt, denim pants, green towel, and hat, in spite of the clear violation of the Miranda doctrine during the custodial investigation of the accused; (3) in convicting him based on mere circumstantial evidence from an account of one highly questionable witness; and (4) in convicting him of the offense charged despite failure of the prosecution to prove the qualifying circumstances of treachery and evident premeditation. [13]\n\nAppellant specifically laments the mode by which Fresnaida Magaway identified him, theorizing that if the witness really knew him, she should have mentioned his name the moment she was asked by the police as to who stabbed the victim, instead of resorting to a \u201cdescriptive identification.\u201d [14]\n\nHe likewise also argues that there was a violation of the Miranda rights of an accused when he was identified by the witness while he was seated on a bench of the investigation room. The manner employed by the investigators in obtaining his T-shirt, pants, towel, slippers, and hat, according to appellant, was a further violation of his rights as these items were taken from him in the absence of his counsel.\n\nThe defense also asserts that the lower court relied upon the testimony of a highly questionable witness in the person of Fresnaida Magaway, and that the conviction of appellant was based purely on circumstantial evidence which should not have been taken as proof beyond reasonable doubt that he really stabbed the victim to death. The final contention is that the prosecution failed to prove either that there was treachery employed by the accused in the killing of the victim or that there was evident premeditation on his part to take her life.\n\nOn the allegation of inconsistency and flaws in the testimony of a single eyewitness, a thorough review of the transcripts of stenographic notes, particularly those on the testimony of witness Fresnaida Magaway, does not reveal any major inconsistency. Instead, the Court is regaled by the unswerving and consistent position of the witness that appellant was the only one whom she saw on that occasion and that he stabbed and killed her teacher, Mrs. Aguinaldo. Any minor lapses therein tend to buttress, rather than weaken, her credibility since they show that she was neither coached nor were her answers contrived. [15]\n\nThe contention of appellant that the expected reaction of the witness should have been to identify him by name is an obvious non sequitur . What should be considered as a general or common rule is that witnesses to a crime react in different ways. In the instant case, the youthful witness was unable to immediately reveal the name of appellant to the police as she was evidently scared or confused and, as she explained, she also failed to name appellant at that time since her concern and thoughts were of her teacher whom she followed to the hospital. Surely, we can not fault the young girl for her confusion and fear, it being her first time to witness such a crime of violence.\n\nThe important thing is that when she testified at the trial, she was firm, spontaneous and categorical in her declaration that it was appellant whom she saw that afternoon, and that it was he who entered the classroom of her teacher and stabbed the latter with a pointed bladed weapon. The witness stood by her declaration, unshaken throughout the entire trial, and never showed any hesitation in her testimony.\n\nAnother fact worth stressing is that the witness had no motive whatsoever to fabricate a serious charge against appellant. When there is no showing that the principal witness for the prosecution was actuated by an improper motive, the presumption is that he was not so actuated, and his testimony is thus entitled to full faith and credit. [16]\n\nAppellant then asseverates that there was a violation of his rights while under custodial investigation, in light of the Miranda doctrine, when allegedly the police investigators unceremoniously stripped him of his clothing and personal items, and the same were later introduced as evidence during the trial. The Court is not persuaded. The protection of the accused under custodial investigation, which is invoked by appellant, refers to testimonial compulsion. Section 12, Article III of the Constitution provides that such accused shall have the right to be informed of his right to remain silent, the right to counsel, and the right to waive the right to counsel in the presence of counsel, and that any confession or admission obtained in violation of his rights shall be inadmissible in evidence against him. As held in People vs. Gamboa , [17] this constitutional right applies only against testimonial compulsion and not when the body of the accused is proposed to be examined. In fact, an accused may validly be compelled to be photographed or measured, or his garments or shoes removed or replaced, or to move his body to enable the foregoing things to be done, without running afoul of the proscription against testimonial compulsion. [18]\n\nThe desperate ploy of appellant that the evidence against him was purely circumstantial does not even warrant refutation. It was definitely established by the prosecution that appellant was actually the one who treacherously attacked the victim. Eyewitness Magaway unequivocally stated and lucidly described how she saw appellant actually stabbing Mrs. Aguinaldo, [19] and even demonstrated during the ocular inspection the specific part of the room where the crime was committed and where she herself was when she witnessed the dastardly deed. [20] As already explained, the defense failed to show that the witness had ill motives in testifying against appellant and there is no doubt in the mind of this Court that the witness really had no personal ill feelings against him. The conclusion that irresistibly emerges, therefore, is that the witness was just honestly relating what she really saw on September 18, 1991, and that she so testified because of her desire for justice and redress for the terrible wrong against her teacher.\n\nThe fourth error assigned by appellant that evident premeditation and treachery were not proved merits some comment. It is correct that evident premeditation was not established. There is no evidence or showing on record when and how appellant planned and prepared for the killing of the victim. His allegation that there was no treachery, however, is a different matter. The attack against Mrs. Aguinaldo was so sudden that, although she was stabbed by appellant while she was facing him, the unexpected attack in itself constituted treachery. The victim was caught unaware and did not have any opportunity to defend herself. Also, from the means and methods adopted by appellant to commit the crime, it would be incredible to assume that the same were not deliberately adopted to insure the consummation of the felony.\n\nLastly, there can be no sensible debate that appellant\u2019s defense of alibi has to be rejected. It is elementary that for this discredited defense, credible and tangible proof of physical impossibility for the accused to be at the scene of the crime is indispensable. [21] In the present case, the court below found that appellant was then just one kilometer away from the scene of the crime. [22] Furthermore, the defense of alibi can not prevail over the positive identification of the accused by an eyewitness who had no improper motive to falsely testify.

      "title": "ROBIN CARI\u00d1O PADILLA, ACCUSED-APPELLANT, VS. COURT OF APPEALS AND PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, PLAINTIFF-APPELLEES. D E C I S I O N FRANCISCO, J.: On appellant Robin C. Padilla's application for bail.In an information filed before the Regional Trial Court of Angeles City, appellant was charged with violation of P.D No. 1866 for illegal possession of firearms punishable by reclusion temporal maximum to reclusion perpetua.[1] Pending trial, appellant was release on bail. Thereafter, appellant was convicted as charged and meted an indeterminate penalty of 17 years 4 months and 1 day of reclusion temporal to 21 years of reclusion perpetua. He appealed to public respondent Court of Appeals, but judgment was rendered affirming his conviction. Respondent court cancelled his bailbond and ordered his arrest for confinement at the New Bilibid Prison. Appellant filed a motion for reconsideration but was denied. Dissatisfied, appellant is now before us by way of a petition for review on certiorari with an application for bail praying, among others, to be allowed to post bail for his temporary liberty. In his subsequent pleading,[2] appellant moved for the separate resolution of his bail application.The threshold issue is whether or not appellant is entitled to bail.Bail is either a matter of right, or discretion. It is a matter of right when the offense charged is not punishable by death, reclusion perpetua or life imprisonment.[3] On the other hand, upon conviction by the Regional Trial Court of an offense not punishable by death, reclusion perpetua or life imprisonment, bail becomes a matter of discretion.[4] Similarly, if the court imposed a penalty of imprisonment exceeding six (6) years but not more that twenty (20) years then bail is a matter of discretion, except when any of the enumerated circumstances[5] under paragraph 3 of Section 5, Rule 114 is present then bail shall be denied. But when the accused is charged with a capital offense, or an offense punishable by reclusion perpetua or life imprisonment, and evidence of guilt is strong, bail shall be denied,[6] as it is neither a matter of right nor discretion. If the evidence, however, is not strong bail becomes a matter of right.[7]In People v. Nitcha,[8] the Court, reiterating established jurisprudence, there said: \"x x x if an accused who is charged with a crime punishable by reclusion perpetua is convicted by the trial court and sentenced to suffer such a penalty, bail is neither a matter of right on the part of the accused nor of discretion on the part of the court. In such a situation, the court would not have only determined that the evidence of guilt is strong \u2014 which would have been sufficient to deny bail even before conviction \u2014 it would have likewise ruled that the accused's guilt has been proven beyond reasonable doubt. Bail must not then be granted to the accused during the pendency of his appeal from the judgment of conviction. Construing Section 3, Rule 114 of the 1985 Rules on Criminal Procedure, as amended, this Court, in the en banc Resolution of 15 October 1991 in People v. Ricardo Cortez, ruled that: 'Pursuant to the aforecited provision, an accused who is charged with a capital offense or an offense punishable by reclusion perpetua, shall no longer be entitled to bail as a matter of right even if he appeals the case to this Court since his conviction clearly imports that the evidence of his guilt of the offense charged is strong.'\"[9] In this case, appellant was convicted of a crime punishable by reclusion perpetua. Applying the aforequoted rule, we find appellant not entitled to bail as his conviction clearly imports that the evidence of his guilt is strong. And contrary to appellant's asseveration, a summary hearing for his bail application for the sole purpose of determining whether or not evidence is strong is unnecessary. Indeed, the extensive trial before the lower court and the appeal before respondent court are more than sufficient in accomplishing the purpose for which a summary hearing for bail application is designed.Rule 114, Section 7 of the Rules of Court, moreover, is clear. Thus: \"SEC. 7. Capital offense or an offense punishable by reclusion perpetua or life imprisonment, not bailable. \u2014 No person charged with a capital offense, or an offense punishable by reclusion perpetua or life imprisonment, when evidence of guilt is strong, shall be admitted to bail regardless of the stage of the criminal prosecution.\"Administrative Circular No. 2-92, in addition, applies in this case. The circular unequivocably provides that when an accused is charged with a capital or an offense which under the law at the time of its commission and at the time of the application for bail is punishable by reclusion perpetua and is out on bail and after trial is convicted by the trial court of the offense charged, his bond shall be cancelled and the accused shall be placed in confinement pending resolution of his appeal. Appellant's application must, perforce, fail as he is no longer entitled to bail.Be that as it may, we are not unwilling to accommodate his request for an X-ray and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) at St. Luke's Hospital as follow-up examinations for his 1994 slipped-disc operation. It has been said that while justice is the first virtue of the court, yet admittedly, humanity is the second. Hence, petitioner's request for the badly needed X-ray and MRI examinations for which the New Bilibid Prison Hospital is inadequately equipped, as certified to by its Chief Officer, deserves attention. We recall that way back in 1946, we allowed in Dela Rama v. People's Court,[10] a precedent on which appellant now anchors his application, a prisoner to be released on bail when his continued detention would be injurious to his health. This trend, however, has changed with the development of times. Besides, appellant's situation is not akin to Dela Rama's factual milieu. While appellant now shall be denied bail, nevertheless, we cannot be indifferent to his medical needs. And by granting appellant's request, the Court is merely performing its supervisory powers over detainees to safeguard, among others, their proper accommodation and health pursuant to Section 25 of Rule 114 of the Rules of Court, as amended.ACCORDINGLY, the cancellation of appellant's bailbond by public respondent court is AFFIRMED and the instant application for bail is DENIED for lack of merit. Appellant's request for an X-ray and MRI examinations at St. Luke's Hospital is GRANTED which should be conducted at the first opportune time to be arranged by the Director of the New Bilibid Prison with the responsible officers of the hospital, provided that appellant shall be at all times subject to the security conditions imposed by the prison's director. The responsibility for the enforcement of the subject request, as well as the security of the appellant, devolves upon the Director of the New Bilibid Prison. Upon termination of the medical examinations, appellant shall be recommitted to prison without delay.

      "title": "RHODORA M. LEDESMA, PETITIONER, VS. COURT OF APPEALS AND HON. MAXIMIANO C. ASUNCION, IN HIS CAPACITY AS PRESIDING JUDGE OF RTC, QUEZON CITY, RESPONDENTS. D E C I S I O N PANGANIBAN, J.: When confronted with a motion to withdraw an information on the ground of lack of probable cause based on a resolution of the secretary of justice, the bounden duty of the trial court is to make an independent assessment of the merits of such motion. Having acquired jurisdiction over the case, the trial court is not bound by such resolution but is required to evaluate it before proceeding further with the trial. While the secretary\u2019s ruling is persuasive, it is not binding on courts. A trial court, however, commits reversible error or even grave abuse of discretion if it refuses/neglects to evaluate such recommendation and simply insists on proceeding with the trial on the mere pretext of having already acquired jurisdiction over the criminal action.This principle is explained in this Decision resolving a petition for review on certiorari of the Decision[1] of the Court of Appeals,[2] promulgated on September 14, 1993 in CA-G.R. SP No. 30832 which in effect affirmed an order of the Regional Trial Court of Quezon City denying the prosecution\u2019s withdrawal of a criminal information against petitioner.The Antecedent FactsFrom the pleadings submitted in this case, the undisputed facts are as follows:Sometime in April 1992, a complaint for libel was filed by Dr. Juan F. Torres, Jr. against Dr. Rhodora M. Ledesma, petitioner herein, before the Quezon City Prosecutor\u2019s Office, docketed as I.S. No. 92-5433A. Petitioner filed her counter-affidavit to the complaint.Finding \u2018sufficient legal and factual basis,\u2019 the Quezon City Prosecutor\u2019s Office filed on July 6, 1992 an Information for libel against petitioner with the Regional Trial Court of Quezon City, Branch 104.[3] The Information filed by Assistant City Prosecutor Augustine A. Vestil reads: [4] \u201cThat on or about the 27th day of June 1991, in Quezon City, Metro Manila, Philippines, the said accused, acting with malice, did, then and there, wilfully, unlawfully and feloniously send a letter addressed to Dr. Esperanza I. Cabral, Director of Philippine Heart Center, East Avenue, this city, and furnished the same to other officers of the said hospital, said letter containing slanderous and defamatory remarks against DR. JUAN F. TORRES, JR., which states in part, to wit:\u201827June 1991 Dr. Esperanza I. Cabral Director Subject: Return of all professional fees due Dr. Rhodora M. Ledesma, Nuclear Medicine Specialist/Consultant, Philippine Heart Center, from January 31, 1989 to January 31, 1991. Respondents: Dr. Juan F. Torres, Jr., Chief, Nuclear Medicine Section Dr. Orestes P. Monzon, Staff Consultant Dear Dr. Cabral, This is to demand the return of all professional fees due me as a consultant in Nuclear Medicine, this Center, since January 31, 1989 until my resignation effective January 31, 1991, amounting to at least P100,000.00 for the year 1990 alone. Records in the Nuclear Medicine Section will show that from January 1989 to January 1991, a total of 2,308 patients were seen. Of these, I had officially supervised, processed, and interpreted approximately a total of 1,551 cases as against approximately 684 and 73 cases done by Dr. Monzon and Dr. Torres respectively. Until my resignation I had received a monthly share of professional fees averaging P1,116.90/month supposedly representing 20% of the total monthly professional fees. The rest were divided equally between Dr. Monzon and Dr. Torres. There was never any agreement between us three consultants that this should be the arrangement and I am certain that this was not with your approval. The burden of unfairness would have been lesser if there was an equal distribution of labor and the schedule of duties were strictly followed. As it was, the schedule of duties submitted monthly to the office of the Asst. Director for Medical Services was simply a dummy to comply with administrative requirements rather than a guideline for strict compliance. Both consultants have complete daily time records even if they did not come regularly. Dr. Torres came for an hour every week, Dr. Monzon came sporadically during the week while I was left with everything from training the residents and supervising the Techs to processing and interpreting the results on a regular basis. I had a part time appointment just like Dr. Monzon and Dr. Torres. In the interest of fairness and to set a precedent for the protection of future PHC Nuclear Medicine Alumni I am calling your attention to the unfair and inhuman conditions I went through as a Consultant in that Section. I trust that your sense of professionalism will put a stop to this corruption. I suggest that a committee be formed to make an audit of the distribution of professional fees in this Section. At this point, let me stress that since professional fees vary according to the type of procedure done and since there was no equity of labor between us I am not settling for an equal percentage share. I demand that I be indemnified of all professional fees due me on a case to case basis. Let me make clear my intention of pursuing this matter legally should there be no favorable action in my behalf. Let me state at this point6 that the actions of Dr. Torres and Dr. Monzon are both unprofessional and unbecoming and are clearly violating the code of ethics of the medical profession and the Philippine Civil Service Rules and Regulations related to graft and corruption. Thank you.\u2019 and other words of similar import, when in truth and in fact, as the accused very well knew, the same are entirely false and untrue but were publicly made for no other purpose than to expose said DR. JUAN F. TORRES, JR. to public ridicule, thereby casting dishonor, discredit and contempt upon the person of the said offended party, to his damage and prejudice.\u201dA petition for review of the resolution of Assistant City Prosecutor Vestil was filed by petitioner before the Department of Justice pursuant to P.D. No. 77 as amended by P.D. No. 911.The Department of Justice gave due course to the petition and directed the Quezon City prosecutor to move for deferment of further proceedings and to elevate the entire records of the case.[5] Accordingly, a \u201cMotion to Defer Arraignment\u201d dated September 7, 1992 was filed by Prosecutor Tirso M. Gavero before the court a quo.[6] On September 9, 1992, the trial court granted the motion and deferred petitioner\u2019s arraignment until the final termination of the petition for review.[7]Without the consent or approval of the trial prosecutor, private complainant, through counsel, filed a Motion to Lift the Order dated September 9, 1992 and to Set the Case for Arraignment/Trial.[8]On January 8, 1993, the trial court issued an Order setting aside its earlier Order of September 9, 1992 and scheduling petitioner\u2019s arraignment on January 18, 1993 at two o\u2019clock in the afternoon.[9]In a resolution dated January 27, 1993, then Justice Secretary Franklin M. Drilon reversed the Quezon City investigating prosecutor. Pertinent portions of Drilon\u2019s ruling read:[10] \u201cFrom the circumstances obtaining, the subject letter was written to bring to the attention of the Director of the Philippine Heart Center for Asia and other responsible authorities the unjust and unfair treatment that Dr. Ledesma was getting from complainants. Since complainants and respondent are government employees, and the subject letter is a complaint to higher authorities of the PHCA on a subject matter in which respondent has an interest and in reference to which she has a duty to question the same is definitely privileged (US vs. Bustos, 37 Phil. 131). Moreover, in Ang vs. Castro, 136 SCRA 455, the Supreme Court, citing Santiago vs. Calvo, 48 Phil. 922, ruled that \u2018A communication made in good faith upon any subject matter in which the party making the communication has an interest or concerning which he has a duty is privileged... although it contains incriminatory or derogatory matter which, without the privilege, would be libelous and actionable. The follow-up letter sent by respondent to the director of the PHCA, is a direct evidence of respondent\u2019s righteous disposition of following the rule of law and is a clear indication that her purpose was to seek relief from the proper higher authority who is the Director of PHCA. The same interpretation should be accorded the civil and administrative complaints which respondent filed against complainants. They are mere manifestations of her earnest desire to pursue proper relief for the alleged injustice she got from complainants. If she was motivated by malice and ill-will in sending the subject communication to the Director of the PHCA, she would not have sent the second letter and filed the administrative and civil cases against complainants. Moreover, it is unbelievable that it took complainants one year to realize that the questioned letter subjected them to public and malicious imputation of a vice or omission. It is beyond the ordinary course of human conduct for complainants to start feeling the effects of the alleged libelous letter \u2014 that of experiencing sleepless nights, wounded feelings, serious anxiety, moral shock and besmirched reputation \u2014 one year after they read the communication in question. The claim that the case of Crespo vs. Mogul, 151 SCRA 462 is applicable to the instant case is unfounded. In the first place, the instant cases are not being reinvestigated. It is the resolutions of the investigating prosecutor that are under review. Further, the record shows that the court has issued an order suspending the proceedings pending the resolutions of the petitions for review by this Office. In the issuance of its order, the court recognizes that the Secretary of Justice has the power and authority to review the resolutions of prosecutors who are under his control and supervision. In view of the foregoing, the appealed resolutions are hereby reversed. You are directed to withdraw the Informations which you filed in Court. Inform this Office of the action taken within ten (10) days from receipt hereof.\u2019In obedience to the above directive, Quezon City Trial Prosecutor Tirso M. Gavero filed a Motion to Withdraw Information dated February 17,1993,[11] attaching thereto the resolution of Secretary Drilon. The trial judge denied this motion in his Order dated February 22, 1993, as follows:[12] \u2018The motion of the trial prosecutor to withdraw the information in the above-entitled case is denied. Instead, the trial prosecutor of this court is hereby directed to prosecute the case following the guidelines and doctrine laid down by the Supreme Court in the case of Crespo vs. Mogul, 151 SCRA 462.\u2019Petitioner\u2019s motion for reconsideration[13] was denied by the trial judge in the Order dated March 5, 1993, as follows:[14] \u201cFinding no cogent reason to justify the reconsideration of the ruling of this Court dated February 22, 1993, the Motion for Reconsideration dated March 1, 1993 filed by the accused through counsel is hereby denied.\u201dAggrieved, petitioner filed a petition for certiorari and prohibition with the Supreme Court. In a Resolution dated March 31, 1993, this Court referred the case to the Court of Appeals for proper determination and disposition pursuant to Section 9, paragraph 1 of B.P. 129.[15]Respondent Court dismissed the petition \u201cfor lack of merit,\u201d holding that it had no jurisdiction to overturn the doctrine laid down in Crespo vs. Mogul \u2014 once a complaint or information has been filed in court, any disposition of the case, i.e., dismissal, conviction or acquittal of the accused, rests on the sound discretion of the trial court.[16]Hence, this recourse to this Court.The IssuesFor unexplained reasons, petitioner failed to make an assignment of errors against the appellate court. Her counsel merely repeated the alleged errors of the trial court: [17] \u201cI. The Orders, dated February 22, 1993 and March 5, 1993, of respondent Judge Asuncion relied solely on the \u2018Crespo vs. Mogul\u2019 (151 SCRA 462) decision. It is respectfully submitted that said case is not applicable because: It infringes on the constitutional separation of powers between the executive and judicial branches of the government; It constitutes or it may lead to misuse or misapplication of \u2018judicial power\u2019 as defined in the Constitution; It goes against the constitutional proscription that rules of procedure should not diminish substantive rights; It goes against the principle of non-delegation of powers; It sets aside or disregards substantive and procedural rules; It deprives a person of his constitutional right to procedural due process; Its application may constitute or lead to denial of equal protection of laws; It deprives the secretary of justice or the president of the power to control or review the acts of a subordinate official; It will lead to, encourage, abet or promote abuse or even corruption among the ranks of investigating fiscals; It does not subserve the purposes of a preliminary investigation because - (10.a) It subjects a person to the burdens of an unnecessary trial, specially in cases where the investigating fiscal recommends no bail for the accused; (10.b) It subjects the government, both the executive and the judiciary, to unnecessary time and expenses attendant to an unnecessary trial; (10.c) It contributes to the clogging of judicial dockets; and It has no statutory or procedural basis or precedent.II. On the assumption that \u2018Crespo vs. Mogul\u2019 is applicable, it is submitted that - Respondent Judge Asuncion committed grave abuse of discretion, amounting to lack of jurisdiction, when he denied the Motion to Withdraw Information since he had already deferred to, if not recognized, the authority of the Secretary of Justice; and The facts in \u2018Crespo vs. Mogul\u2019 are different from the instant case. Hence, respondent Judge Asuncion committed grave abuse of discretion, amounting to lack of jurisdiction, when he relied solely on said case in denying the Motion to Withdraw Information.\u201dIn sum, the main issue in this petition is: Did Respondent Court commit any reversible error in affirming the trial court\u2019s denial of the prosecution\u2019s Motion to Withdraw Information?The Court\u2019s RulingThe petition is impressed with merit. We answer the above question in the affirmative.Preliminary MatterBefore discussing the substance of this case, the Court will preliminarily address a procedural matter. Prior to the effectivity of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure on July 1, 1997, Section 2 of Rule 45, which governed appeals from the Court of Appeals to the Supreme Court, provided: \u201cSEC. 2. Contents of petition.\u2014The petition shall contain a concise statement of x x x the assignment of errors made in the court below x x x.\u201dA petition for review on certiorari under Rule 45 requires a concise statement of the errors committed by the Court of Appeals, not of the trial court. For failure to follow this Rule, the petition could have been dismissed by this Court motu proprio, considering that under Section 4 of the same Rule, \u201creview is not a matter of right but of sound discretion.\u201dWe take this occasion to stress the need for precision and clarity in the assignment of errors. Review under this rule is unlike an appeal in a criminal case where the death penalty, reclusi\u00f3n perpetua or life imprisonment is imposed and where the whole case is opened for review. Under Rule 45, only the issues raised therein by the petitioner will be passed upon by the Court, such that an erroneous specification of the issues may cause the dismissal of the petition. We stressed this in Circular No. 2-90, entitled \u201cGuidelines to be Observed in Appeals to the Court of Appeals and to the Supreme Court,\u201d as follows: \u201c4. Erroneous Appeals. x x x x e) Duty of counsel.\u2014It is therefore incumbent upon every attorney who would seek review of a judgment or order promulgated against his client to make sure of the nature of the errors he proposes to assign, whether these be of fact or of law; then upon such basis to ascertain carefully which Court has appellate jurisdiction; and finally, to follow scrupulously the requisites for appeal prescribed by law, ever aware that any error or imprecision in compliance may well be fatal to his client\u2019s cause.FOR STRICT COMPLIANCE.\u201dBe that as it may, the Court \u2014 noting the importance of the substantial matters raised \u2014 decided to overlook petitioner\u2019s lapse and granted due course to the petition per Resolution dated July 15, 1996, with a warning that henceforth petitions which fail to specify an assignment of errors of the proper lower court may be denied due course motu proprio by this Court.Determination of Probable Cause Is an Executive FunctionThe determination of probable cause during a preliminary investigation is judicially recognized as an executive function and is made by the prosecutor. The primary objective of a preliminary investigation is to free a respondent from the inconvenience, expense, ignominy and stress of defending himself/herself in the course of a formal trial, until the reasonable probability of his or her guilt has been passed upon in a more or less summary proceeding by a competent officer designated by law for that purpose. Secondarily, such summary proceeding also protects the state from the burden of unnecessary expense and effort in prosecuting alleged offenses and in holding trials arising from false, frivolous or groundless charges.[18]Such investigation is not a part of the trial. A full and exhaustive presentation of the parties\u2019 evidence is not required, but only such as may engender a well-grounded belief that an offense has been committed and that the accused is probably guilty thereof.[19] By reason of the abbreviated nature of preliminary investigations, a dismissal of the charges as a result thereof is not equivalent to a judicial pronouncement of acquittal. Hence, no double jeopardy attaches.In declaring this function to be lodged in the prosecutor, the Court distinguished the determination of probable cause for the issuance of a warrant of arrest or a search warrant from a preliminary investigation proper in this wise:[20] \u201cxxx Judges and prosecutors alike should distinguish the preliminary inquiry which determines probable cause for the issuance of a warrant of arrest from a preliminary investigation proper which ascertains whether the offender should be held for trial or released. xxx The determination of probable cause for the warrant of arrest is made by the Judge. The preliminary investigation proper \u2014 whether xxx there is reasonable ground to believe that the accused is guilty of the offense charged and, therefore, whether xxx he should be subjected to the expense, rigors and embarrassment of trial \u2014 is the function of the prosecutor. We reiterate that preliminary investigation should be distinguished as to whether it is an investigation for the determination of a sufficient ground for the filing of the information or it is an investigation for the determination of a probable cause for the issuance of a warrant of arrest. The first kind of preliminary investigation is executive in nature. It is part of the prosecutor\u2019s job. The second kind of preliminary investigation which is more properly called preliminary examination is judicial in nature and is lodged with the judge.\u201dSound policy supports this distinction. Otherwise, judges would be unduly laden with the preliminary examination and investigation of criminal complaints instead of concentrating on hearing and deciding cases filed before their courts. The Separate Opinion of Mr. Chief Justice Andres R. Narvasa in Roberts, Jr. vs. Court of Appeals stressed that the determination of the existence of probable cause properly pertains to the public prosecutor in the \u201cestablished scheme of things,\u201d and that the proceedings therein are \u201cessentially preliminary, prefatory and cannot lead to a final, definite and authoritative judgment of the guilt or innocence of the persons charged with a felony or a crime.\u201d[21]In Crespo vs. Mogul,[22] the Court emphasized the cardinal principle that the public prosecutor controls and directs the prosecution of criminal offenses thus: \u201cIt is a cardinal principle that all criminal actions either commenced by complaint or by information shall be prosecuted under the direction and control of the fiscal. The institution of a criminal action depends upon the sound discretion of the fiscal. He may or may not file the complaint or information, follow or not follow that presented by the offended party, according to whether the evidence in his opinion, is sufficient or not to establish the guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt. The reason for placing the criminal prosecution under the direction and control of the fiscal is to prevent malicious or unfounded prosecution by private persons. It cannot be controlled by the complainant. Prosecuting officers under the power vested in them by law, not only have the authority but also the duty of prosecuting persons who, according to the evidence received from the complainant, are shown to be guilty of a crime committed within the jurisdiction of their office. They have equally the legal duty not to prosecute when after an investigation they become convinced that the evidence adduced is not sufficient to establish a prima facie case.\u201dIn the same case, the Court added that where there is a clash of views between a judge who did not investigate and a fiscal who conducted a reinvestigation, those of the prosecutor should normally prevail:[23] \u201cx x x The Courts cannot interfere with the fiscal\u2019s discretion and control of the criminal prosecution. It is not prudent or even permissible for a Court to compel the fiscal to prosecute a proceeding originally initiated by him on an information, if he finds that the evidence relied upon by him is insufficient for conviction. Neither has the Court any power to order the fiscal to prosecute or file an information within a certain period of time, since this would interfere with the fiscal\u2019s discretion and control of criminal prosecutions. Thus, a fiscal who asks for the dismissal of the case for insufficiency of evidence has authority to do so, and Courts that grant the same commit no error. The fiscal may re-investigate a case and subsequently move for the dismissal should the re-investigation show either that the defendant is innocent or that his guilt may not be established beyond reasonable doubt. In a clash of views between the judge who did not investigate and the fiscal who did, or between the fiscal and the offended party or the defendant, those of the fiscal\u2019s should normally prevail. x x x x.\u201d Appeal as an Exercise of the Justice Secretary\u2019s Power of Control Over ProsecutorsDecisions or resolutions of prosecutors are subject to appeal to the secretary of justice who, under the Revised Administrative Code, exercises the power of direct control and supervision over said prosecutors; and who may thus affirm, nullify, reverse or modify their rulings.Section 39, Chapter 8, Book IV in relation to Section 5, 8, and 9, Chapter 2, Title III of the Code gives the secretary of justice supervision and control over the Office of the Chief Prosecutor and the Provincial and City Prosecution Offices. The scope of his power of supervision and control is delineated in Section 38, paragraph 1, Chapter 7, Book IV of the Code: \u201c(1) Supervision and Control.\u2014 Supervision and control shall include authority to act directly whenever a specific function is entrusted by law or regulation to a subordinate; direct the performance of duty; restrain the commission of acts; review, approve, reverse or modify acts and decisions of subordinate officials or units; xxxx.\u201dSupplementing the aforequoted provisions are Section 3 of R.A. 3783 and Section 37 of Act 4007, which read: \u201cSection 3. x x x x The Chief State Prosecutor, the Assistant Chief State Prosecutors, the Senior State Prosecutors, and the State Prosecutors shall x x x perform such other duties as may be assigned to them by the Secretary of Justice in the interest of public service.\u201d x x x x x x x x x \u201cSection 37. The provisions of the existing law to the contrary notwithstanding, whenever a specific power, authority, duty, function, or activity is entrusted to a chief of bureau, office, division or service, the same shall be understood as also conferred upon the proper Department Head who shall have authority to act directly in pursuance thereof, or to review, modify, or revoke any decision or action of said chief of bureau, office, division or service.\u201d\u201cSupervision\u201d and \u201ccontrol\u201d of a department head over his subordinates have been defined in administrative law as follows:[24] \u201cIn administrative law supervision means overseeing or the power or authority of an officer to see that subordinate officers perform their duties. If the latter fail or neglect to fulfill them, the former may take such action or step as prescribed by law to make them perform such duties. Control, on the other hand, means the power of an officer to alter or modify or nullify or set aside what a subordinate officer had done in the performance of his duties and to substitute the judgment of the former for that of the latter.\u201dReview as an act of supervision and control by the justice secretary over the fiscals and prosecutors finds basis in the doctrine of exhaustion of administrative remedies which holds that mistakes, abuses or negligence committed in the initial steps of an administrative activity or by an administrative agency should be corrected by higher administrative authorities, and not directly by courts. As a rule, only after administrative remedies are exhausted may judicial recourse be allowed.Appeal to the Secretary of Justice Is Not Foreclosed by the Ruling in CrespoIn Marcelo vs. Court of Appeals,[25] the Court clarified that Crespo[26] did not foreclose the power or authority of the secretary of justice to review resolutions of his subordinates in criminal cases. The Court recognized in Crespo that the action of the investigating fiscal or prosecutor in the preliminary investigation is subject to the approval of the provincial or city fiscal or chief state prosecutor. Thereafter, it may be appealed to the secretary of justice.The justice secretary\u2019s power of review may still be availed of despite the filing of an information in court. In his discretion, the secretary may affirm, modify or reverse resolutions of his subordinates pursuant to Republic Act No. 5180, as amended,[27] specifically in Section 1 (d): \u201c(d) x x x Provided, finally, That where the resolution of the Provincial or City Fiscal or the Chief State Prosecutor is, upon review, reversed by the Secretary of Justice, the latter may, where he finds that no prima facie case exists, authorize and direct the investigating fiscal concerned or any other fiscal or state prosecutor to cause or move for the dismissal of the case, or, where he finds a prima facie case, to cause the filing of an information in court against the respondent, based on the same sworn statements or evidence submitted without the necessity of conducting another preliminary investigation.\u201dPursuant thereto, the Department of Justice promulgated Circular No. 7 dated January 25, 1990 governing appeals in preliminary investigation. Appeals under Section 2 are limited to resolutions dismissing a criminal complaint. However, Section 4 provides an exception: appeals from resolutions finding probable cause upon a showing of manifest error or grave abuse of discretion are allowed, provided the accused has not been arraigned. In the present case, petitioner\u2019s appeal to the secretary of justice was given due course on August 26, 1992 pursuant to this Circular.On June 30, 1993, Circular No. 7 was superseded by Department Order No. 223; however, the scope of appealable cases remained unchanged: \u201cSECTION 1. What May Be Appealed. \u2014 Only resolutions of the Chief State Prosecutor/Regional State Prosecutor/Provincial or City Prosecutor dismissing a criminal complaint may be the subject of an appeal to the Secretary of Justice except as otherwise provided in Section 4 hereof. Appeals from the resolutions of provincial/city prosecutors where the penalty prescribed for the offense charged does not exceed prisi\u00f3n correccional, regardless of the imposable fine, shall be made to the Regional State Prosecutors who shall resolve the appeals with finality, pursuant to Department Order No. 318 dated August 28, 1991 as amended by D.O. No. 34 dated February 4, 1992, D.O. No. 223 dated August 11, 1992 and D.O. No. 45 dated February 2, 1993. Such appeals shall also be governed by these rules. SEC. 4. Non-Appealable Cases; Exceptions.\u2014No appeal may be taken from a resolution of the Chief State Prosecutor/Regional State Prosecutor/Provincial or City Prosecutor finding probable cause except upon showing of manifest error or grave abuse of discretion. Notwithstanding the showing of manifest error or grave abuse of discretion, no appeal shall be entertained where the appellant had already been arraigned. If the appellant (is) arraigned during the pendency of the appeal, x x x appeal shall be dismissed motu proprio by the Secretary of Justice. An appeal/motion for reinvestigation from a resolution finding probable cause, however, shall not hold the filing of the information in court.\u201dApart from the foregoing statutory and administrative issuances, the power of review of the secretary of justice is recognized also by Section 4 of Rule 112 of the Rules of Court: \u201cSEC. 4. Duty of investigating fiscal.\u2014x x x x x x x x x x x x x If upon petition by a proper party, the Secretary of Justice reverses the resolution of the provincial or city fiscal or chief state prosecutor, he shall direct the fiscal concerned to file the corresponding information without conducting another preliminary investigation or to dismiss or move for dismissal of the complaint or information.\u201dThis appeal rests upon the sound discretion of the secretary of justice arising from his power of supervision and control over the prosecuting arm of the government, not on a substantial right on the part of the accused as claimed by petitioner.Appeal Did Not Divest the Trial Court of JurisdictionWhere the secretary of justice exercises his power of review only after an information has been filed, trial courts should defer or suspend arraignment and further proceedings until the appeal is resolved. Such deferment or suspension, however, does not signify that the trial court is ipso facto bound by the resolution of the secretary of justice. Jurisdiction, once acquired by the trial court, is not lost despite a resolution by the secretary of justice to withdraw the information or to dismiss the case.Judicial Review of the Resolution of the Secretary of JusticeJudicial power is defined under the 1987 Constitution as the duty of courts to settle actual controversies involving rights which are legally demandable and enforceable. Such power includes the determination of whether there has been a grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction on the part of any branch or instrumentality of the government.[28] Under this definition, a court is without power to directly decide matters over which full discretionary authority has been delegated to the legislative or executive branch of the government. It is not empowered to substitute its judgment for that of Congress or of the President. It may, however, look into the question of whether such exercise has been made in grave abuse of discretion.Judicial review of the acts of other departments is not an assertion of superiority over them or a derogation of their functions. In the words of Justice Laurel in Angara vs. Electoral Commission:[29] \u201cx x x [W]hen the judiciary mediates to allocate constitutional boundaries, it does not in reality nullify or invalidate an act of the legislature, but only asserts the solemn and sacred obligation assigned to it by the Constitution to determine conflicting claims of authority under the Constitution and to establish for the parties in an actual controversy the rights which that instrument sources and guarantees to them. This is in truth all that is involved in what is termed \u2018judicial supremacy\u2019 which properly is the power of the judicial review under the Constitution. x x x.\u201dIt is not the purpose of this Court to decrease or limit the discretion of the secretary of justice to review the decisions of the government prosecutors under him. In Crespo, the secretary was merely advised to restrict such review to exceptionally meritorious cases. Rule 112, Section 4 of the Rules of Court, which recognizes such power, does not, however, allow the trial court to automatically dismiss the case or grant the withdrawal of the information upon the resolution of the secretary of justice. This is precisely the import of Crespo, Marcelo, Martinez vs. Court of Appeals[30] and the recent case of Roberts, Jr. vs. Court of Appeals, which all required the trial court to make its own evaluation of the merits of the case, because granting the motion to dismiss or to withdraw the information is equivalent to effecting a disposition of the case itself.The Marcelo and Martinez Cases Are ConsistentIn Marcelo vs. Court of Appeals,[31] this Court ruled that, although it is more prudent to wait for a final resolution of a motion for review or reinvestigation from the secretary of justice before acting on a motion to dismiss or a motion to withdraw an information, a trial court nonetheless should make its own study and evaluation of said motion and not rely merely on the awaited action of the secretary. The trial court has the option to grant or deny the motion to dismiss the case filed by the fiscal, whether before or after the arraignment of the accused, and whether after a reinvestigation or upon instructions of the secretary who reviewed the records of the investigation; provided that such grant or denial is made from its own assessment and evaluation of the merits of the motion.In Martinez vs. Court of Appeals,[32] this Court overruled the grant of the motion to dismiss filed by the prosecuting fiscal upon the recommendation of the secretary of justice because such grant was based upon considerations other than the judge\u2019s own assessment of the matter. Relying solely on the conclusion of the prosecution to the effect that there was no sufficient evidence against the accused to sustain the allegation in the information, the trial judge did not perform his function of making an independent evaluation or assessment of the merits of the case.Despite the pronouncement in Marcelo that a final resolution of the appeal to the Department of Justice is necessary, both decisions followed the rule in Crespo vs. Mogul: Once a complaint or information is filed in court, any disposition of the case such as its dismissal or its continuation rests on the sound discretion of the court. Trial judges are thus required to make their own assessment of whether the secretary of justice committed grave abuse of discretion in granting or denying the appeal, separately and independently of the prosecution\u2019s or the secretary\u2019s evaluation that such evidence is insufficient or that no probable cause to hold the accused for trial exists. They should embody such assessment in their written order disposing of the motion.The above-mentioned cases depict two extreme cases in complying with this rule. In Marcelo, the dismissal of the criminal action upon the favorable recommendation of the Review Committee, Office of the City Prosecutor, was precipitate in view of the pendency of private complainant\u2019s appeal to the secretary of justice. In effect, the secretary\u2019s opinion was totally disregarded by the trial court. In contrast, in Martinez the dismissal of the criminal action was an \u201cerroneous exercise of judicial discretion\u201d as the trial court relied hook, line and sinker on the resolution of the secretary, without making its own independent determination of the merits of the said resolution. No Grave Abuse of Discretion in the Resolution of the Secretary of JusticeIn the light of recent holdings in Marcelo and Martinez; and considering that the issue of the correctness of the justice secretary\u2019s resolution has been amply threshed out in petitioner\u2019s letter, the information, the resolution of the secretary of justice, the motion to dismiss, and even the exhaustive discussion in the motion for reconsideration \u2014 all of which were submitted to the court -- the trial judge committed grave abuse of discretion when it denied the motion to withdraw the information, based solely on his bare and ambiguous reliance on Crespo. The trial court\u2019s order is inconsistent with our repetitive calls for an independent and competent assessment of the issue(s) presented in the motion to dismiss. The trial judge was tasked to evaluate the secretary\u2019s recommendation finding the absence of probable cause to hold petitioner criminally liable for libel. He failed to do so. He merely ruled to proceed with the trial without stating his reasons for disregarding the secretary\u2019s recommendation.Had he complied with his judicial obligation, he would have discovered that there was, in fact, sufficient ground to grant the motion to withdraw the information. The documents before the trial court judge clearly showed that there was no probable cause to warrant a criminal prosecution for libel.Under the \u201cestablished scheme of things\u201d in criminal prosecutions, this Court would normally remand the case to the trial judge for his or her independent assessment of the motion to withdraw the information. However, in order not to delay the disposition of this case and to afford the parties complete relief, we have decided to make directly the independent assessment the trial court should have done. The petitioner has attached as annexes to the present petition for review the information, which contains a complete and faithful reproduction of the subject letter, the resolution of the secretary of justice, the prosecution\u2019s motion for reconsideration of the trial court\u2019s Order of February 22, 1993, and even the private complainant\u2019s opposition to said motion. The records below have been reproduced and submitted to this Court for its appreciation. Thus, a remand to the trial court serves no purpose and will only clog the dockets.We thus proceed to examine the substance of the resolution of the secretary of justice. The secretary reversed the finding of probable cause on the grounds that (1) the subject letter was privileged in nature and (2) the complaint was merely a countercharge.In every case for libel, the following requisites must concur: \u201c(a) it must be defamatory; (b) it must be malicious; (c) it must be given publicity; and (d) the victim must be identifiable.\u201dAt the preliminary investigation stage, these requisites must show prima facie a well-founded belief that a crime has been committed and that the accused probably committed it. A cursory reading of the information immediately demonstrates a failure on the part of the complainant to establish the foregoing elements of libel.Every defamatory imputation, even if true, is presumed malicious, if no good intention or justifiable motive for making it is shown. There is malice when the author of the imputation is prompted by personal ill will or spite and speaks not in response to duty but merely to injure the reputation of the person who claims to have been defamed.[33] In this case however, petitioner\u2019s letter was written to seek redress of proper grievance against the inaccurate distribution and payment of professional fees and against unfair treatment in the Nuclear Medicine Department of the Philippine Heart Center. It is a qualified privileged communication under Article 354(1) of the Revised Penal Code which provides: \u201cART. 354. Requirement of publicity. \u2014 Every defamatory imputation is presumed to be malicious, even if it be true, if no good intention and justifiable motive for making it is shown, except in the following cases: A private communication made by any person to another in the performance of any legal, moral or social duty; and x x x x x x x x x\" The rule on privileged communication is that a communication made in good faith on any subject matter in which the communicator has an interest, or concerning which he has a duty, is privileged if made to a person having a corresponding interest or duty, although it contains incriminatory matter which, without the privilege, would be libelous and actionable. Petitioner\u2019s letter was a private communication made in the performance of a moral duty on her part. Her intention was not to inflict an unjustifiable harm on the private complainant, but to present her grievance to her superior. The privileged nature of her letter overcomes the presumption of malice. There is no malice when justifiable motive exists; and in the absence of malice, there is no libel. We note that the information itself failed to allege the existence of malice.Thus, we agree with the ruling of the secretary of justice:[34] \u201cx x x (T)he subject letter was written to bring to the attention of the Director of the Philippine Heart Center for Asia and other responsible authorities the unjust and unfair treatment that Dr. Ledesma was getting from government employees, and the subject letter is a complaint x x x on a subject matter in which respondent has an interest and in reference to which she has a duty to question the same is definitely privileged (US vs. Bustos, 37 Phil. 131). Moreover, in Ang vs. Castro, 136 SCRA 455, the Supreme Court, citing Santiago vs. Calvo, 48 Phil. 922, ruled that \u2018a communication made in good faith upon any subject matter in which the party making the communication has an interest or concerning which he has a duty is privileged although it contains incriminatory or derogatory matter which, without the privilege, would be libelous and actionable. The follow-up letter sent by respondent to the director of the PHCA, is a direct evidence of respondent\u2019s righteous disposition of following the rule of law and is a clear indication that her purpose was to seek relief from the proper higher authority xxx. The same interpretation should be accorded the civil and administrative complaints which respondent filed against complainants. They are mere manifestations of her earnest desire to pursue proper relief for the alleged injustice she got from complainants. If she was motivated by malice and ill-will in sending the subject communication to the Director of the PHCA, she would not have sent the second letter and filed the administrative and civil cases against complainants.\u201dIn Alonzo, the settled rule is that, when a public officer, in the discharge of his or her official duties, sends a communication to another officer or to a body of officers, who have a duty to perform with respect to the subject matter of the communication, such communication does not amount to publication within the meaning of the law on defamation.[35] Publication in libel means making the defamatory matter, after it has been written, known to someone other than the person to whom it has been written.[36] The reason for such rule is that \u201ca communication of the defamatory matter to the person defamed cannot injure his reputation though it may wound his self-esteem. A man\u2019s reputation is not the good opinion he has of himself, but the estimation in which others hold him.\u201d[37] In this case, petitioner submitted the letter to the director of said hospital; she did not disseminate the letter and its contents to third persons. Hence, there was no \u201cpublicity\u201d and the matter is clearly covered by paragraph 1 of Article 354 of the Penal Code.Further, we note that the information against petitioner was filed only on July 27, 1992 or one year after June 27, 1991, the date the letter was sent. It is obviously nothing more than a countercharge to give Complainant Torres a leverage against petitioner\u2019s administrative action against him.Ineluctably, Judge Asuncion\u2019s denial of the motion to withdraw the information and the reconsideration thereof was not only precipitate but manifestly erroneous. This is further compounded by the fact that he did not explain his grounds for his denial inasmuch as he did not make an independent assessment of the motion or the arguments in the resolution of the secretary of justice. All in all, such rash action did not do justice to the sound ruling in Crespo vs. Mogul upon which, ironically, he supposedly rested his action, or to the directive in Marcelo and Martinez where this Court required trial courts to make an independent assessment of the merits of the motion.WHEREFORE, the assailed Decision is hereby REVERSED and SET ASIDE.

ASUNCION, IN HIS CAPACITY AS PRESIDING JUDGE OF RTC, QUEZON CITY, RESPONDENTS.\n\nD E C I S I O N\n\nPANGANIBAN, J.:\n\nWhen confronted with a motion to withdraw an information on the ground of lack of probable cause based on a resolution of the secretary of justice, the bounden duty of the trial court is to make an independent assessment of the merits of such motion. Having acquired jurisdiction over the case, the trial court is not bound by such resolution but is required to evaluate it before proceeding further with the trial. While the secretary\u2019s ruling is persuasive, it is not binding on courts. A trial court, however, commits reversible error or even grave abuse of discretion if it refuses/neglects to evaluate such recommendation and simply insists on proceeding with the trial on the mere pretext of having already acquired jurisdiction over the criminal action.\n\nThis principle is explained in this Decision resolving a petition for review on certiorari of the Decision [1] of the Court of Appeals, [2] promulgated on September 14, 1993 in CA-G.R. SP No. 30832 which in effect affirmed an order of the Regional Trial Court of Quezon City denying the prosecution\u2019s withdrawal of a criminal information against petitioner.\n\nThe Antecedent Facts\n\nFrom the pleadings submitted in this case, the undisputed facts are as follows:\n\nSometime in April 1992, a complaint for libel was filed by Dr. Juan F. Torres, Jr. against Dr. Rhodora M. Ledesma, petitioner herein, before the Quezon City Prosecutor\u2019s Office, docketed as I.S. No. 92-5433A. Petitioner filed her counter-affidavit to the complaint.\n\nFinding \u2018sufficient legal and factual basis,\u2019 the Quezon City Prosecutor\u2019s Office filed on July 6, 1992 an Information for libel against petitioner with the Regional Trial Court of Quezon City, Branch 104. [3] The Information filed by Assistant City Prosecutor Augustine A. Vestil reads: [4]\n\n\u201cThat on or about the 27th day of June 1991, in Quezon City, Metro Manila, Philippines, the said accused, acting with malice, did, then and there, wilfully, unlawfully and feloniously send a letter addressed to Dr. Esperanza I. Cabral, Director of Philippine Heart Center, East Avenue, this city, and furnished the same to other officers of the said hospital, said letter containing slanderous and defamatory remarks against DR. JUAN F. TORRES, JR., which states in part, to wit:\n\n[TABLE_CONTENT]\n\u201827June 1991 | \n | \nDr. Esperanza I.

Cabral Director Subject: Return of all professional fees due Dr. Rhodora M. Ledesma, Nuclear Medicine Specialist/Consultant, Philippine Heart Center, from January 31, 1989 to January 31, 1991. Respondents: Dr. Juan F. Torres, Jr., Chief, Nuclear Medicine Section Dr. Orestes P. Monzon, Staff Consultant Dear Dr. Cabral,\n\nThis is to demand the return of all professional fees due me as a consultant in Nuclear Medicine, this Center, since January 31, 1989 until my resignation effective January 31, 1991, amounting to at least P100,000.00 for the year 1990 alone. Records in the Nuclear Medicine Section will show that from January 1989 to January 1991, a total of 2,308 patients were seen. Of these, I had officially supervised, processed, and interpreted approximately a total of 1,551 cases as against approximately 684 and 73 cases done by Dr. Monzon and Dr. Torres respectively.\n\nUntil my resignation I had received a monthly share of professional fees averaging P1,116.90/month supposedly representing 20% of the total monthly professional fees. The rest were divided equally between Dr. Monzon and Dr. Torres. There was never any agreement between us three consultants that this should be the arrangement and I am certain that this was not with your approval. The burden of unfairness would have been lesser if there was an equal distribution of labor and the schedule of duties were strictly followed. As it was, the schedule of duties submitted monthly to the office of the Asst. Director for Medical Services was simply a dummy to comply with administrative requirements rather than a guideline for strict compliance. Both consultants have complete daily time records even if they did not come regularly. Dr. Torres came for an hour every week, Dr. Monzon came sporadically during the week while I was left with everything from training the residents and supervising the Techs to processing and interpreting the results on a regular basis. I had a part time appointment just like Dr. Monzon and Dr. Torres.\n\nIn the interest of fairness and to set a precedent for the protection of future PHC Nuclear Medicine Alumni I am calling your attention to the unfair and inhuman conditions I went through as a Consultant in that Section. I trust that your sense of professionalism will put a stop to this corruption.\n\nI suggest that a committee be formed to make an audit of the distribution of professional fees in this Section. At this point, let me stress that since professional fees vary according to the type of procedure done and since there was no equity of labor between us I am not settling for an equal percentage share. I demand that I be indemnified of all professional fees due me on a case to case basis.\n\nLet me make clear my intention of pursuing this matter legally should there be no favorable action in my behalf. Let me state at this point6 that the actions of Dr. Torres and Dr. Monzon are both unprofessional and unbecoming and are clearly violating the code of ethics of the medical profession and the Philippine Civil Service Rules and Regulations related to graft and corruption.\n\nThank you.\u2019\n\nand other words of similar import, when in truth and in fact, as the accused very well knew, the same are entirely false and untrue but were publicly made for no other purpose than to expose said DR. JUAN F. TORRES, JR. to public ridicule, thereby casting dishonor, discredit and contempt upon the person of the said offended party, to his damage and prejudice.\u201d\n\nA petition for review of the resolution of Assistant City Prosecutor Vestil was filed by petitioner before the Department of Justice pursuant to P.D. No. 77 as amended by P.D. No. 911.\n\nThe Department of Justice gave due course to the petition and directed the Quezon City prosecutor to move for deferment of further proceedings and to elevate the entire records of the case. [5] Accordingly, a \u201cMotion to Defer Arraignment\u201d dated September 7, 1992 was filed by Prosecutor Tirso M. Gavero before the court a quo . [6] On September 9, 1992, the trial court granted the motion and deferred petitioner\u2019s arraignment until the final termination of the petition for review. [7]\n\nWithout the consent or approval of the trial prosecutor, private complainant, through counsel, filed a Motion to Lift the Order dated September 9, 1992 and to Set the Case for Arraignment/Trial. [8]\n\nOn January 8, 1993, the trial court issued an Order setting aside its earlier Order of September 9, 1992 and scheduling petitioner\u2019s arraignment on January 18, 1993 at two o\u2019clock in the afternoon. [9]\n\nIn a resolution dated January 27, 1993, then Justice Secretary Franklin M. Drilon reversed the Quezon City investigating prosecutor. Pertinent portions of Drilon\u2019s ruling read: [10]\n\n\u201cFrom the circumstances obtaining, the subject letter was written to bring to the attention of the Director of the Philippine Heart Center for Asia and other responsible authorities the unjust and unfair treatment that Dr. Ledesma was getting from complainants. Since complainants and respondent are government employees, and the subject letter is a complaint to higher authorities of the PHCA on a subject matter in which respondent has an interest and in reference to which she has a duty to question the same is definitely privileged (US vs. Bustos, 37 Phil. 131). Moreover, in Ang vs. Castro, 136 SCRA 455, the Supreme Court, citing Santiago vs. Calvo, 48 Phil. 922, ruled that \u2018A communication made in good faith upon any subject matter in which the party making the communication has an interest or concerning which he has a duty is privileged... although it contains incriminatory or derogatory matter which, without the privilege, would be libelous and actionable.\n\nThe follow-up letter sent by respondent to the director of the PHCA, is a direct evidence of respondent\u2019s righteous disposition of following the rule of law and is a clear indication that her purpose was to seek relief from the proper higher authority who is the Director of PHCA.\n\nThe same interpretation should be accorded the civil and administrative complaints which respondent filed against complainants. They are mere manifestations of her earnest desire to pursue proper relief for the alleged injustice she got from complainants. If she was motivated by malice and ill-will in sending the subject communication to the Director of the PHCA, she would not have sent the second letter and filed the administrative and civil cases against complainants.\n\nMoreover, it is unbelievable that it took complainants one year to realize that the questioned letter subjected them to public and malicious imputation of a vice or omission. It is beyond the ordinary course of human conduct for complainants to start feeling the effects of the alleged libelous letter \u2014 that of experiencing sleepless nights, wounded feelings, serious anxiety, moral shock and besmirched reputation \u2014 one year after they read the communication in question.\n\nThe claim that the case of Crespo vs. Mogul, 151 SCRA 462 is applicable to the instant case is unfounded. In the first place, the instant cases are not being reinvestigated. It is the resolutions of the investigating prosecutor that are under review. Further, the record shows that the court has issued an order suspending the proceedings pending the resolutions of the petitions for review by this Office. In the issuance of its order, the court recognizes that the Secretary of Justice has the power and authority to review the resolutions of prosecutors who are under his control and supervision.\n\nIn view of the foregoing, the appealed resolutions are hereby reversed. You are directed to withdraw the Informations which you filed in Court. Inform this Office of the action taken within ten (10) days from receipt hereof.\u2019\n\nIn obedience to the above directive, Quezon City Trial Prosecutor Tirso M. Gavero filed a Motion to Withdraw Information dated February 17,1993, [11] attaching thereto the resolution of Secretary Drilon. The trial judge denied this motion in his Order dated February 22, 1993, as follows: [12]\n\n\u2018The motion of the trial prosecutor to withdraw the information in the above-entitled case is denied. Instead, the trial prosecutor of this court is hereby directed to prosecute the case following the guidelines and doctrine laid down by the Supreme Court in the case of Crespo vs. Mogul, 151 SCRA 462.\u2019\n\nPetitioner\u2019s motion for reconsideration [13] was denied by the trial judge in the Order dated March 5, 1993, as follows: [14]\n\n\u201cFinding no cogent reason to justify the reconsideration of the ruling of this Court dated February 22, 1993, the Motion for Reconsideration dated March 1, 1993 filed by the accused through counsel is hereby denied.\u201d\n\nAggrieved, petitioner filed a petition for certiorari and prohibition with the Supreme Court. In a Resolution dated March 31, 1993, this Court referred the case to the Court of Appeals for proper determination and disposition pursuant to Section 9, paragraph 1 of B.P. 129. [15]\n\nRespondent Court dismissed the petition \u201cfor lack of merit,\u201d holding that it had no jurisdiction to overturn the doctrine laid down in Crespo vs. Mogul \u2014 once a complaint or information has been filed in court, any disposition of the case, i.e., dismissal, conviction or acquittal of the accused, rests on the sound discretion of the trial court. [16]\n\nHence, this recourse to this Court.\n\nThe Issues\n\nFor unexplained reasons, petitioner failed to make an assignment of errors against the appellate court. Her counsel merely repeated the alleged errors of the trial court: [17]\n\n\u201cI. The Orders, dated February 22, 1993 and March 5, 1993, of respondent Judge Asuncion relied solely on the \u2018Crespo vs. Mogul\u2019 (151 SCRA 462) decision. It is respectfully submitted that said case is not applicable because: It infringes on the constitutional separation of powers between the executive and judicial branches of the government;\nIt constitutes or it may lead to misuse or misapplication of \u2018judicial power\u2019 as defined in the Constitution;\nIt goes against the constitutional proscription that rules of procedure should not diminish substantive rights; It goes against the principle of non-delegation of powers; It sets aside or disregards substantive and procedural rules; It deprives a person of his constitutional right to procedural due process; Its application may constitute or lead to denial of equal protection of laws; It deprives the secretary of justice or the president of the power to control or review the acts of a subordinate official; It will lead to, encourage, abet or promote abuse or even corruption among the ranks of investigating fiscals; It does not subserve the purposes of a preliminary investigation because -\n\n(10.a) It subjects a person to the burdens of an unnecessary trial, specially in cases where the investigating fiscal recommends no bail for the accused;\n\n(10.b) It subjects the government, both the executive and the judiciary, to unnecessary time and expenses attendant to an unnecessary trial;\n\n(10.c) It contributes to the clogging of judicial dockets; and It has no statutory or procedural basis or precedent.\n\nII. On the assumption that \u2018Crespo vs. Mogul\u2019 is applicable, it is submitted that -\nRespondent Judge Asuncion committed grave abuse of discretion, amounting to lack of jurisdiction, when he denied the Motion to Withdraw Information since he had already deferred to, if not recognized, the authority of the Secretary of Justice; and The facts in \u2018Crespo vs. Mogul\u2019 are different from the instant case. Hence, respondent Judge Asuncion committed grave abuse of discretion, amounting to lack of jurisdiction, when he relied solely on said case in denying the Motion to Withdraw Information.\u201d\n\nIn sum, the main issue in this petition is: Did Respondent Court commit any reversible error in affirming the trial court\u2019s denial of the prosecution\u2019s Motion to Withdraw Information?\n\nThe Court\u2019s Ruling\n\nThe petition is impressed with merit. We answer the above question in the affirmative.\n\nPreliminary Matter\n\nBefore discussing the substance of this case, the Court will preliminarily address a procedural matter. Prior to the effectivity of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure on July 1, 1997, Section 2 of Rule 45, which governed appeals from the Court of Appeals to the Supreme Court, provided:\n\n\u201cSEC. 2. Contents of petition .\u2014The petition shall contain a concise statement of x x x the assignment of errors made in the court below x x x.\u201d\n\nA petition for review on certiorari under Rule 45 requires a concise statement of the errors committed by the Court of Appeals, not of the trial court. For failure to follow this Rule, the petition could have been dismissed by this Court motu proprio , considering that under Section 4 of the same Rule, \u201creview is not a matter of right but of sound discretion.\u201d\n\nWe take this occasion to stress the need for precision and clarity in the assignment of errors. Review under this rule is unlike an appeal in a criminal case where the death penalty, reclusi\u00f3n perpetua or life imprisonment is imposed and where the whole case is opened for review. Under Rule 45, only the issues raised therein by the petitioner will be passed upon by the Court, such that an erroneous specification of the issues may cause the dismissal of the petition. We stressed this in Circular No. 2-90, entitled \u201cGuidelines to be Observed in Appeals to the Court of Appeals and to the Supreme Court,\u201d as follows:\n\n\u201c4. Erroneous Appeals. x x x x\n\ne) Duty of counsel.\u2014It is therefore incumbent upon every attorney who would seek review of a judgment or order promulgated against his client to make sure of the nature of the errors he proposes to assign, whether these be of fact or of law; then upon such basis to ascertain carefully which Court has appellate jurisdiction; and finally, to follow scrupulously the requisites for appeal prescribed by law, ever aware that any error or imprecision in compliance may well be fatal to his client\u2019s cause.\n\nFOR STRICT COMPLIANCE.\u201d\n\nBe that as it may, the Court \u2014 noting the importance of the substantial matters raised \u2014 decided to overlook petitioner\u2019s lapse and granted due course to the petition per Resolution dated July 15, 1996, with a warning that henceforth petitions which fail to specify an assignment of errors of the proper lower court may be denied due course motu proprio by this Court.\n\nDetermination of Probable Cause\nIs an Executive Function\n\nThe determination of probable cause during a preliminary investigation is judicially recognized as an executive function and is made by the prosecutor. The primary objective of a preliminary investigation is to free a respondent from the inconvenience, expense, ignominy and stress of defending himself/herself in the course of a formal trial, until the reasonable probability of his or her guilt has been passed upon in a more or less summary proceeding by a competent officer designated by law for that purpose. Secondarily, such summary proceeding also protects the state from the burden of unnecessary expense and effort in prosecuting alleged offenses and in holding trials arising from false, frivolous or groundless charges. [18]\n\nSuch investigation is not a part of the trial. A full and exhaustive presentation of the parties\u2019 evidence is not required, but only such as may engender a well-grounded belief that an offense has been committed and that the accused is probably guilty thereof. [19] By reason of the abbreviated nature of preliminary investigations, a dismissal of the charges as a result thereof is not equivalent to a judicial pronouncement of acquittal. Hence, no double jeopardy attaches.\n\nIn declaring this function to be lodged in the prosecutor, the Court distinguished the determination of probable cause for the issuance of a warrant of arrest or a search warrant from a preliminary investigation proper in this wise: [20]\n\n\u201cxxx Judges and prosecutors alike should distinguish the preliminary inquiry which determines probable cause for the issuance of a warrant of arrest from a preliminary investigation proper which ascertains whether the offender should be held for trial or released. xxx The determination of probable cause for the warrant of arrest is made by the Judge. The preliminary investigation proper \u2014 whether xxx there is reasonable ground to believe that the accused is guilty of the offense charged and, therefore, whether xxx he should be subjected to the expense, rigors and embarrassment of trial \u2014 is the function of the prosecutor.\n\nWe reiterate that preliminary investigation should be distinguished as to whether it is an investigation for the determination of a sufficient ground for the filing of the information or it is an investigation for the determination of a probable cause for the issuance of a warrant of arrest. The first kind of preliminary investigation is executive in nature. It is part of the prosecutor\u2019s job. The second kind of preliminary investigation which is more properly called preliminary examination is judicial in nature and is lodged with the judge.\u201d\n\nSound policy supports this distinction. Otherwise, judges would be unduly laden with the preliminary examination and investigation of criminal complaints instead of concentrating on hearing and deciding cases filed before their courts. The Separate Opinion of Mr. Chief Justice Andres R. Narvasa in Roberts, Jr. vs. Court of Appeals stressed that the determination of the existence of probable cause properly pertains to the public prosecutor in the \u201cestablished scheme of things,\u201d and that the proceedings therein are \u201cessentially preliminary, prefatory and cannot lead to a final, definite and authoritative judgment of the guilt or innocence of the persons charged with a felony or a crime.\u201d [21]\n\nIn Crespo vs. Mogul , [22] the Court emphasized the cardinal principle that the public prosecutor controls and directs the prosecution of criminal offenses thus:\n\n\u201cIt is a cardinal principle that all criminal actions either commenced by complaint or by information shall be prosecuted under the direction and control of the fiscal. The institution of a criminal action depends upon the sound discretion of the fiscal. He may or may not file the complaint or information, follow or not follow that presented by the offended party, according to whether the evidence in his opinion, is sufficient or not to establish the guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt. The reason for placing the criminal prosecution under the direction and control of the fiscal is to prevent malicious or unfounded prosecution by private persons. It cannot be controlled by the complainant. Prosecuting officers under the power vested in them by law, not only have the authority but also the duty of prosecuting persons who, according to the evidence received from the complainant, are shown to be guilty of a crime committed within the jurisdiction of their office. They have equally the legal duty not to prosecute when after an investigation they become convinced that the evidence adduced is not sufficient to establish a prima facie case.\u201d\n\nIn the same case, the Court added that where there is a clash of views between a judge who did not investigate and a fiscal who conducted a reinvestigation, those of the prosecutor should normally prevail: [23]\n\n\u201cx x x\u00a0 The Courts cannot interfere with the fiscal\u2019s discretion and control of the criminal prosecution. It is not prudent or even permissible for a Court to compel the fiscal to prosecute a proceeding originally initiated by him on an information, if he finds that the evidence relied upon by him is insufficient for conviction. Neither has the Court any power to order the fiscal to prosecute or file an information within a certain period of time, since this would interfere with the fiscal\u2019s discretion and control of criminal prosecutions. Thus, a fiscal who asks for the dismissal of the case for insufficiency of evidence has authority to do so, and Courts that grant the same commit no error. The fiscal may re-investigate a case and subsequently move for the dismissal should the re-investigation show either that the defendant is innocent or that his guilt may not be established beyond reasonable doubt. In a clash of views between the judge who did not investigate and the fiscal who did, or between the fiscal and the offended party or the defendant, those of the fiscal\u2019s should normally prevail. x x x x.\u201d\n\nAppeal as an Exercise of the Justice\nSecretary\u2019s Power of Control Over Prosecutors\n\nDecisions or resolutions of prosecutors are subject to appeal to the secretary of justice who, under the Revised Administrative Code, exercises the power of direct control and supervision over said prosecutors; and who may thus affirm, nullify, reverse or modify their rulings.\n\nSection 39, Chapter 8, Book IV in relation to Section 5, 8, and 9, Chapter 2, Title III of the Code gives the secretary of justice supervision and control over the Office of the Chief Prosecutor and the Provincial and City Prosecution Offices. The scope of his power of supervision and control is delineated in Section 38, paragraph 1, Chapter 7, Book IV of the Code:\n\n\u201c(1) Supervision and Control .\u2014 Supervision and control shall include authority to act directly whenever a specific function is entrusted by law or regulation to a subordinate; direct the performance of duty; restrain the commission of acts; review, approve, reverse or modify acts and decisions of subordinate officials or units; xxxx.\u201d\n\nSupplementing the aforequoted provisions are Section 3 of R.A. 3783 and Section 37 of Act 4007, which read:\n\n\u201cSection 3. x x x x\n\nThe Chief State Prosecutor, the Assistant Chief State Prosecutors, the Senior State Prosecutors, and the State Prosecutors shall x x x perform such other duties as may be assigned to them by the Secretary of Justice in the interest of public service.\u201d\n\n[TABLE_CONTENT]\nx x x | | x x x | | x x x\n[END_TABLE]\n\nx x x x x x x x x \u201cSection 37. The provisions of the existing law to the contrary notwithstanding, whenever a specific power, authority, duty, function, or activity is entrusted to a chief of bureau, office, division or service, the same shall be understood as also conferred upon the proper Department Head who shall have authority to act directly in pursuance thereof, or to review, modify, or revoke any decision or action of said chief of bureau, office, division or service.\u201d\n\n\u201cSupervision\u201d and \u201ccontrol\u201d of a department head over his subordinates have been defined in administrative law as follows: [24]\n\n\u201cIn administrative law supervision means overseeing or the power or authority of an officer to see that subordinate officers perform their duties. If the latter fail or neglect to fulfill them, the former may take such action or step as prescribed by law to make them perform such duties. Control, on the other hand, means the power of an officer to alter or modify or nullify or set aside what a subordinate officer had done in the performance of his duties and to substitute the judgment of the former for that of the latter.\u201d\n\nReview as an act of supervision and control by the justice secretary over the fiscals and prosecutors finds basis in the doctrine of exhaustion of administrative remedies which holds that mistakes, abuses or negligence committed in the initial steps of an administrative activity or by an administrative agency should be corrected by higher administrative authorities, and not directly by courts. As a rule, only after administrative remedies are exhausted may judicial recourse be allowed.\n\nAppeal to the Secretary of Justice Is Not\nForeclosed by the Ruling in Crespo\n\nIn Marcelo vs. Court of Appeals, [25] the Court clarified that Crespo [26] did not foreclose the power or authority of the secretary of justice to review resolutions of his subordinates in criminal cases. The Court recognized in Crespo that the action of the investigating fiscal or prosecutor in the preliminary investigation is subject to the approval of the provincial or city fiscal or chief state prosecutor. Thereafter, it may be appealed to the secretary of justice.\n\nThe justice secretary\u2019s power of review may still be availed of despite the filing of an information in court. In his discretion, the secretary may affirm, modify or reverse resolutions of his subordinates pursuant to Republic Act No. 5180, as amended, [27] specifically in Section 1 (d):\n\n\u201c(d) x x x Provided, finally, That where the resolution of the Provincial or City Fiscal or the Chief State Prosecutor is, upon review, reversed by the Secretary of Justice, the latter may, where he finds that no prima facie case exists, authorize and direct the investigating fiscal concerned or any other fiscal or state prosecutor to cause or move for the dismissal of the case, or, where he finds a prima facie case, to cause the filing of an information in court against the respondent, based on the same sworn statements or evidence submitted without the necessity of conducting another preliminary investigation.\u201d\n\nPursuant thereto, the Department of Justice promulgated Circular No. 7 dated January 25, 1990 governing appeals in preliminary investigation. Appeals under Section 2 are limited to resolutions dismissing a criminal complaint. However, Section 4 provides an exception: appeals from resolutions finding probable cause upon a showing of manifest error or grave abuse of discretion are allowed, provided the accused has not been arraigned. In the present case, petitioner\u2019s appeal to the secretary of justice was given due course on August 26, 1992 pursuant to this Circular.\n\nOn June 30, 1993, Circular No. 7 was superseded by Department Order No. 223; however, the scope of appealable cases remained unchanged:\n\n\u201cSECTION 1. What May Be Appealed. \u2014 Only resolutions of the Chief State Prosecutor/Regional State Prosecutor/Provincial or City Prosecutor dismissing a criminal complaint may be the subject of an appeal to the Secretary of Justice except as otherwise provided in Section 4 hereof.\n\nAppeals from the resolutions of provincial/city prosecutors where the penalty prescribed for the offense charged does not exceed prisi\u00f3n correccional , regardless of the imposable fine, shall be made to the Regional State Prosecutors who shall resolve the appeals with finality, pursuant to Department Order No. 318 dated August 28, 1991 as amended by D.O. No. 34 dated February 4, 1992, D.O. No. 223 dated August 11, 1992 and D.O. No. 45 dated February 2, 1993. Such appeals shall also be governed by these rules.\n\nSEC. 4. Non-Appealable Cases; Exceptions. \u2014No appeal may be taken from a resolution of the Chief State Prosecutor/Regional State Prosecutor/Provincial or City Prosecutor finding probable cause except upon showing of manifest error or grave abuse of discretion. Notwithstanding the showing of manifest error or grave abuse of discretion, no appeal shall be entertained where the appellant had already been arraigned. If the appellant (is) arraigned during the pendency of the appeal, x x x appeal shall be dismissed motu proprio by the Secretary of Justice.\n\nAn appeal/motion for reinvestigation from a resolution finding probable cause, however, shall not hold the filing of the information in court.\u201d\n\nApart from the foregoing statutory and administrative issuances, the power of review of the secretary of justice is recognized also by Section 4 of Rule 112 of the Rules of Court:\n\n\u201cSEC. 4. Duty of investigating fiscal. \u2014x x x x\n\n[TABLE_CONTENT]\nx x x | | x x x | | x x x\n[END_TABLE]\n\nx x x x x x x x x If upon petition by a proper party, the Secretary of Justice reverses the resolution of the provincial or city fiscal or chief state prosecutor, he shall direct the fiscal concerned to file the corresponding information without conducting another preliminary investigation or to dismiss or move for dismissal of the complaint or information.\u201d\n\nThis appeal rests upon the sound discretion of the secretary of justice arising from his power of supervision and control over the prosecuting arm of the government, not on a substantial right on the part of the accused as claimed by petitioner.\n\nAppeal Did Not Divest the\nTrial Court of Jurisdiction\n\nWhere the secretary of justice exercises his power of review only after an information has been filed, trial courts should defer or suspend arraignment and further proceedings until the appeal is resolved. Such deferment or suspension, however, does not signify that the trial court is ipso facto bound by the resolution of the secretary of justice. Jurisdiction, once acquired by the trial court, is not lost despite a resolution by the secretary of justice to withdraw the information or to dismiss the case.\n\nJudicial Review of the Resolution\nof the Secretary of Justice\n\nJudicial power is defined under the 1987 Constitution as the duty of courts to settle actual controversies involving rights which are legally demandable and enforceable. Such power includes the determination of whether there has been a grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction on the part of any branch or instrumentality of the government. [28] Under this definition, a court is without power to directly decide matters over which full discretionary authority has been delegated to the legislative or executive branch of the government. It is not empowered to substitute its judgment for that of Congress or of the President. It may, however, look into the question of whether such exercise has been made in grave abuse of discretion.\n\nJudicial review of the acts of other departments is not an assertion of superiority over them or a derogation of their functions. In the words of Justice Laurel in Angara vs. Electoral Commission : [29]\n\n\u201cx x x [W]hen the judiciary mediates to allocate constitutional boundaries, it does not in reality nullify or invalidate an act of the legislature, but only asserts the solemn and sacred obligation assigned to it by the Constitution to determine conflicting claims of authority under the Constitution and to establish for the parties in an actual controversy the rights which that instrument sources and guarantees to them. This is in truth all that is involved in what is termed \u2018judicial supremacy\u2019 which properly is the power of the judicial review under the Constitution. x x x.\u201d\n\nIt is not the purpose of this Court to decrease or limit the discretion of the secretary of justice to review the decisions of the government prosecutors under him. In Crespo , the secretary was merely advised to restrict such review to exceptionally meritorious cases. Rule 112, Section 4 of the Rules of Court, which recognizes such power, does not, however, allow the trial court to automatically dismiss the case or grant the withdrawal of the information upon the resolution of the secretary of justice. This is precisely the import of Crespo, Marcelo, Martinez vs. Court of Appeals [30] and the recent case of Roberts, Jr. vs. Court of Appeals, which all required the trial court to make its own evaluation of the merits of the case, because granting the motion to dismiss or to withdraw the information is equivalent to effecting a disposition of the case itself.\n\nThe Marcelo and Martinez\nCases Are Consistent\n\nIn Marcelo vs. Court of Appeals, [31] this Court ruled that, although it is more prudent to wait for a final resolution of a motion for review or reinvestigation from the secretary of justice before acting on a motion to dismiss or a motion to withdraw an information, a trial court nonetheless should make its own study and evaluation of said motion and not rely merely on the awaited action of the secretary. The trial court has the option to grant or deny the motion to dismiss the case filed by the fiscal, whether before or after the arraignment of the accused, and whether after a reinvestigation or upon instructions of the secretary who reviewed the records of the investigation; provided that such grant or denial is made from its own assessment and evaluation of the merits of the motion.\n\nIn Martinez vs. Court of Appeals, [32] this Court overruled the grant of the motion to dismiss filed by the prosecuting fiscal upon the recommendation of the secretary of justice because such grant was based upon considerations other than the judge\u2019s own assessment of the matter. Relying solely on the conclusion of the prosecution to the effect that there was no sufficient evidence against the accused to sustain the allegation in the information, the trial judge did not perform his function of making an independent evaluation or assessment of the merits of the case.\n\nDespite the pronouncement in Marcelo that a final resolution of the appeal to the Department of Justice is necessary, both decisions followed the rule in Crespo vs. Mogul: Once a complaint or information is filed in court, any disposition of the case such as its dismissal or its continuation rests on the sound discretion of the court. Trial judges are thus required to make their own assessment of whether the secretary of justice committed grave abuse of discretion in granting or denying the appeal, separately and independently of the prosecution\u2019s or the secretary\u2019s evaluation that such evidence is insufficient or that no probable cause to hold the accused for trial exists. They should embody such assessment in their written order disposing of the motion.\n\nThe above-mentioned cases depict two extreme cases in complying with this rule. In Marcelo, the dismissal of the criminal action upon the favorable recommendation of the Review Committee, Office of the City Prosecutor, was precipitate in view of the pendency of private complainant\u2019s appeal to the secretary of justice. In effect, the secretary\u2019s opinion was totally disregarded by the trial court. In contrast, in Martinez the dismissal of the criminal action was an \u201cerroneous exercise of judicial discretion\u201d as the trial court relied hook, line and sinker on the resolution of the secretary, without making its own independent determination of the merits of the said resolution.\n\nNo Grave Abuse of Discretion in the\nResolution of the Secretary of Justice\n\nIn the light of recent holdings in Marcelo and Martinez; and considering that the issue of the correctness of the justice secretary\u2019s resolution has been amply threshed out in petitioner\u2019s letter, the information, the resolution of the secretary of justice, the motion to dismiss, and even the exhaustive discussion in the motion for reconsideration \u2014 all of which were submitted to the court -- the trial judge committed grave abuse of discretion when it denied the motion to withdraw the information, based solely on his bare and ambiguous reliance on Crespo . The trial court\u2019s order is inconsistent with our repetitive calls for an independent and competent assessment of the issue(s) presented in the motion to dismiss. The trial judge was tasked to evaluate the secretary\u2019s recommendation finding the absence of probable cause to hold petitioner criminally liable for libel. He failed to do so. He merely ruled to proceed with the trial without stating his reasons for disregarding the secretary\u2019s recommendation.\n\nHad he complied with his judicial obligation, he would have discovered that there was, in fact, sufficient ground to grant the motion to withdraw the information. The documents before the trial court judge clearly showed that there was no probable cause to warrant a criminal prosecution for libel.\n\nUnder the \u201cestablished scheme of things\u201d in criminal prosecutions, this Court would normally remand the case to the trial judge for his or her independent assessment of the motion to withdraw the information. However, in order not to delay the disposition of this case and to afford the parties complete relief, we have decided to make directly the independent assessment the trial court should have done. The petitioner has attached as annexes to the present petition for review the information, which contains a complete and faithful reproduction of the subject letter, the resolution of the secretary of justice, the prosecution\u2019s motion for reconsideration of the trial court\u2019s Order of February 22, 1993, and even the private complainant\u2019s opposition to said motion. The records below have been reproduced and submitted to this Court for its appreciation. Thus, a remand to the trial court serves no purpose and will only clog the dockets.\n\nWe thus proceed to examine the substance of the resolution of the secretary of justice. The secretary reversed the finding of probable cause on the grounds that (1) the subject letter was privileged in nature and (2) the complaint was merely a countercharge.\n\nIn every case for libel, the following requisites must concur:\n\n\u201c(a) it must be defamatory;\n\n(b) it must be malicious;\n\n(c) it must be given publicity; and\n\n(d) the victim must be identifiable.\u201d\n\nAt the preliminary investigation stage, these requisites must show prima facie a well-founded belief that a crime has been committed and that the accused probably committed it. A cursory reading of the information immediately demonstrates a failure on the part of the complainant to establish the foregoing elements of libel.\n\nEvery defamatory imputation, even if true, is presumed malicious, if no good intention or justifiable motive for making it is shown. There is malice when the author of the imputation is prompted by personal ill will or spite and speaks not in response to duty but merely to injure the reputation of the person who claims to have been defamed. [33] In this case however, petitioner\u2019s letter was written to seek redress of proper grievance against the inaccurate distribution and payment of professional fees and against unfair treatment in the Nuclear Medicine Department of the Philippine Heart Center. It is a qualified privileged communication under Article 354(1) of the Revised Penal Code which provides:\n\n\u201cART. 354. Requirement of publicity . \u2014 Every defamatory imputation is presumed to be malicious, even if it be true, if no good intention and justifiable motive for making it is shown, except in the following cases: A private communication made by any person to another in the performance of any legal, moral or social duty; and\n\n[TABLE_CONTENT]\nx x x | | x x x | | x x x\"\n[END_TABLE]\n\nx x x x x x x x x\"\n\nThe rule on privileged communication is that a communication made in good faith on any subject matter in which the communicator has an interest, or concerning which he has a duty, is privileged if made to a person having a corresponding interest or duty, although it contains incriminatory matter which, without the privilege, would be libelous and actionable. Petitioner\u2019s letter was a private communication made in the performance of a moral duty on her part. Her intention was not to inflict an unjustifiable harm on the private complainant, but to present her grievance to her superior. The privileged nature of her letter overcomes the presumption of malice. There is no malice when justifiable motive exists; and in the absence of malice, there is no libel. We note that the information itself failed to allege the existence of malice.\n\nThus, we agree with the ruling of the secretary of justice: [34]\n\n\u201cx x x (T)he subject letter was written to bring to the attention of the Director of the Philippine Heart Center for Asia and other responsible authorities the unjust and unfair treatment that Dr. Ledesma was getting from government employees, and the subject letter is a complaint x x x on a subject matter in which respondent has an interest and in reference to which she has a duty to question the same is definitely privileged (US vs. Bustos, 37 Phil. 131). Moreover, in Ang vs. Castro, 136 SCRA 455, the Supreme Court, citing Santiago vs. Calvo, 48 Phil. 922, ruled that \u2018a communication made in good faith upon any subject matter in which the party making the communication has an interest or concerning which he has a duty is privileged although it contains incriminatory or derogatory matter which, without the privilege, would be libelous and actionable.\n\nThe follow-up letter sent by respondent to the director of the PHCA, is a direct evidence of respondent\u2019s righteous disposition of following the rule of law and is a clear indication that her purpose was to seek relief from the proper higher authority xxx.\n\nThe same interpretation should be accorded the civil and administrative complaints which respondent filed against complainants. They are mere manifestations of her earnest desire to pursue proper relief for the alleged injustice she got from complainants. If she was motivated by malice and ill-will in sending the subject communication to the Director of the PHCA, she would not have sent the second letter and filed the administrative and civil cases against complainants.\u201d\n\nIn Alonzo , the settled rule is that, when a public officer, in the discharge of his or her official duties, sends a communication to another officer or to a body of officers, who have a duty to perform with respect to the subject matter of the communication, such communication does not amount to publication within the meaning of the law on defamation. [35] Publication in libel means making the defamatory matter, after it has been written, known to someone other than the person to whom it has been written. [36] The reason for such rule is that \u201ca communication of the defamatory matter to the person defamed cannot injure his reputation though it may wound his self-esteem. A man\u2019s reputation is not the good opinion he has of himself, but the estimation in which others hold him.\u201d [37] In this case, petitioner submitted the letter to the director of said hospital; she did not disseminate the letter and its contents to third persons. Hence, there was no \u201cpublicity\u201d and the matter is clearly covered by paragraph 1 of Article 354 of the Penal Code.\n\nFurther, we note that the information against petitioner was filed only on July 27, 1992 or one year after June 27, 1991, the date the letter was sent. It is obviously nothing more than a countercharge to give Complainant Torres a leverage against petitioner\u2019s administrative action against him.\n\nIneluctably, Judge Asuncion\u2019s denial of the motion to withdraw the information and the reconsideration thereof was not only precipitate but manifestly erroneous. This is further compounded by the fact that he did not explain his grounds for his denial inasmuch as he did not make an independent assessment of the motion or the arguments in the resolution of the secretary of justice. All in all, such rash action did not do justice to the sound ruling in Crespo vs. Mogul upon which, ironically, he supposedly rested his action, or to the directive in Marcelo and Martinez where this Court required trial courts to make an independent assessment of the merits of the motion.\n\nWHEREFORE , the assailed Decision is hereby REVERSED and SET ASIDE.

PRESIDING JUDGE OF RTC, QUEZON CITY, BR. 105 AND MANILA BANKING CORPORATION, RESPONDENTS.[G.R. No. 128422] DOLORES V. MOLINA, PETITIONER, VS. THE HONORABLE COURT OF APPEALS AND EPIMACO ORETA, RESPONDENTS. [G.R. No. 128911] THE MANILA BANKING CORPORATION AND ALBERTO V. REYES, PETITIONERS, VS. DOLORES V. MOLINA AND HON. MARCIANO BACALLA, IN HIS CAPACITY AS PRESIDING JUDGE OF THE REGIONAL TRIAL COURT OF QUEZON CITY, BRANCH 216, RESPONDENTS.DECISION LEONEN, J.: These consolidated cases involve matters that have long been settled by this court. However, petitioner in G.R. Nos. 112564 and 128422, Dolores V. Molina, remained incessant in filing suits that led to the unnecessary clogging not only of this court's but the lower courts' dockets as well.G.R. Nos. 109645 and 112564 were decided by this court on July 25, 1994.[1] A Motion for Reconsideration was filed by Dolores V. Molina (Molina) on August 10, 1994. She later filed two supplements to the Motion for Reconsideration.[2] Her Motion for Reconsideration was denied with finality in the Resolution dated January 23, 1995. Despite the denial of Molina's Motion for Reconsideration, she filed a \"Motion for Leave to File the Herein Incorporated Second Motion for Reconsideration and to Allow x x x Dolores V. Molina a Day in Court Relative to Her Petition for Reconstitution.\"[3] In the Resolution dated March 1, 1995, this court denied with finality Molina's Motion for Reconsideration.[4]In the Resolution dated March 4, 1996, this court found Molina guilty of contempt of court and imposed a fine of P1,000.00.[5]On August 15, 1997, this court decided the administrative case against Judge Tirso Velasco (Judge Velasco).[6]In order to fully comprehend the facts of G.R. Nos. 128422 and 128911, we summarize this court's decision in G.R. Nos. 109645 and 112564.I G.R. No. 109645[7]On November 14, 1991, Molina filed a Petition for Reconstitution of Transfer Certificate of Title (TCT) No. 124088.[8] She alleged that the original copy of TCT No. 124088 was lost when the Quezon City Register of Deeds was gutted by fire on June 11, 1988 and that she has an \"owner's duplicate copy of the title . . . and that the title is not subject of any document or contract creating a lien or encumbrance on the land therein described.\"[9]Several days later, Molina moved to withdraw her Petition, explaining that she had to go to the United States. Judge Velasco granted her Motion to Withdraw and dismissed the case.[10]On April 3, 1992, Molina \"filed an ex-parte motion for review of LRC Case No. Q-5404.\"[11] The Motion was granted on the same date.[12]The Office of the Solicitor General objected to the Ex-parte Motion on the ground that the owners of the adjacent properties were not notified.[13] In the Order dated July 3, 1992, Judge Velasco acknowledged that his court had yet to acquire jurisdiction over the owners of the adjacent properties.[14]On July 13, 1992, Molina filed an Ex-parte Motion praying for Notices of Hearing to be served on the:(a) \"subject owners\" of specified lots in the corresponding \"Technical Description of the subject land;\" (b) the \"President of the Corinthian Neighborhood Association or Corinthian Homeowners Association thru the Barangay Chairman of Barangay Corinthian because the adjoining property designated as Vicente Madrigal is now part of this Barangay Corinthian;\" (c) the \"Director, Bureau of Land, Plaza Cervantes Manila as adjoining owner designated as Public Land;\" and (d) the \"City Engineer of Quezon City for the adjoining boundaries designated as Roads or Road Lot.\"[15]However, the Clerk of Court gave the Notices of Hearing only to the President of the Corinthian Neighborhood Association, the Director of the Bureau of Lands, and the City Engineer of Quezon City. Thus, the owners of the adjacent lots were not served copies of the Notices of Hearing.[16]At this point, Ortigas & Company Limited (Ortigas) found out about Molina's Petition and filed an Opposition.[17] Ortigas subsequently filed a supplemental pleading and alleged the following:(1) The \"proliferation of syndicates taking advantage of the destruction by fire of land titles kept by the Quezon City Register of Deeds.\"[18](2) Molina is 'a well-known land speculator' as shown by the petitions she has previously filed. Further, the bases for her claims are contradictory. In Land Registration Case No. Q-336 (WIDORA case), Molina claimed ownership by acquisition through prescription, having been in open and adverse possession of the property for more than thirty (30) years while in Civil Case No. 90-4749, she claimed that she purchased the property from a certain Eusebia Molina.[19](3) The Land Registration Authority's report which states that:[T]he plan [being] relied upon by Molina, Psd-16740 \"appears to be derived from two different surveys, numbered Psu-1148 & Psu-20191, neither of which appear(s) to have been the subject of original registration; thus it is presumed that no original title had been issued from which TCT-124088 could have emanated;\" that said plan \"is a portion of (LRC) SWO-15352 which is being applied for registration of title in Land Reg. Case No. Q-336, LRC Rec. No. N-50589,\" etc.[20]Ortigas' counsel informed the Manila Mission of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, Inc. (Mormons) of Molina's pending Petition. Thus, the Mormons filed an Opposition.[21]During the hearing, Molina did not mention that she acquired the land through prescription. Instead, she testified as follows:[S]he and her late husband had acquired the two (2) parcels of land in question from the latter's relatives in 1939; that she had in truth seen the deed of sale and the titles in her husband's possession; that her husband was killed by the Japanese in 1944; that it was only in the 1960's that she attempted to obtain titles to the property in her name, and sought the help of President Marcos, who \"became her boyfriend;\" that Marcos had, in turn, referred her for legal assistance to former Judge Echeverri; that she had subsequently left for the United States where she stayed until her return during the martial law regime at which time, however, she could no longer get in touch with either Judge Echeverri or President Marcos; that sometime in 1990 she met Gen. Fabian Ver in Singapore, and she was then told that Marcos had given instructions for the delivery to her of the title to the disputed lands, to be accomplished back in Manila; that the title (TCT 124088) was actually delivered to her by Col. Balbino Diego in November, 1990 at her house in Philam Life Homes Subdivision in Quezon City; that she learned that the title had been entrusted to Col. Diego in 1986, when Gen. Ver and President Marcos fled the country, but Diego had been unable to give her the title earlier because he was placed under house arrest shortly after Marcos' deposal and remained under such restraint until May 11, 1988.[22]On September 23, 1992, Judge Velasco granted Molina's Petition and directed the Quezon City Register of Deeds to reconstitute TCT No. 124088 in Molina's name.[23]Ortigas and the Office of the Solicitor General filed their respective Notices of Appeal, while the Mormons filed a Motion for Reconsideration.[24]Meanwhile, Molina \"filed a motion to strike the notice of appeal or in the alternative, to allow execution of the decision pending appeal.\"[25]Judge Velasco dismissed Ortigas' Notice of Appeal, denied the Mormons' Motion for Reconsideration, and granted Molina's Motion for Execution pending appeal.[26] Consequently, Molina was issued TCT No. RT-58287.[27]The Solicitor General's Notice of Appeal was dismissed in a separate Order on the ground that:the Solicitor General has not filed any formal opposition to the petition and neither has it introduced and/or formally offered any evidence to warrant its dismissal, it appearing on the contrary, that the Land Management Bureau, the DENR, the Register of Deeds and the City Engineer's Office of Quezon City, which are the government agencies directly involved in this kind of proceeding has not registered any opposition to the petition, the notice of appeal filed by him[28] was sham aside from being ten (10) days late.[29]The Mormons withdrew their Appeal because Molina recognized their ownership and possession of \"an area of 8,860 sq. m. and covered by TCT No. 348048[.]\"[30]Molina subdivided the property covered by TCT No. RT-58287 into five parcels. One of the parcels of land was purchased by Gateway Enterprises Co., Inc.[31]Ortigas then filed a Petition for Certiorari and Mandamus with prayer for the issuance of a temporary restraining order.[32] Ortigas prayed that this court:(1) Invalidate Judge Velasco's Orders dated October 14, 1992 and February 10, 1993; and(2) That the TCTs issued, based on Judge Velasco's Order dated October 14, 1992, \"be declared void ab initio and that, alternatively, respondent Judge be ordered to act on the notices of appeal seasonably filed by forwarding the records of LRC Case No. Q-5404 to the Court of Appeals.\"[33]IIG.R. No. 112564[34]G.R. No. 112564 originated from an action for \"Annulment of Transfer Certificate of Title with Damages and Prayer for Preliminary Injunction and Restraining Order\"[35] filed by The Manila Banking Corporation (TMBC) against Molina and Gateway Enterprises Company, Inc. This was docketed as Case No. Q93-15920.[36]TMBC alleged that it owned several parcels of land covered by TCT No. 124088. The subject properties of TMBC's claim were \"formerly covered by TCT Nos. 77652 and 77653\"[37] under Ortigas' name. These properties were converted into a subdivision of several lots. Some of the lots were sold to Manila Interpublic Development Corporation and to Breeders Feeds, Inc. The lots purchased by these two corporations were mortgaged to TMBC as security for their respective loans. The mortgages were foreclosed, and titles were issued in TMBC's name \"as the highest bidder at the foreclosure sales.\"[38]Molina filed a Motion to Dismiss, citing \"litis pendentia, lack of jurisdiction, bar by prior judgment, plaintiffs [referring to TMBC] lack of status as a real party in interest, and failure of the complaint to state a cause of action.\"[39]Molina also alleged that a restraining order was issued with regard to TCT No. 124088 and that the trial court where Case No. Q93-15920 was pending \"had no jurisdiction to annul the judgment of a coordinate court.\"[40]The trial court denied Molina's Motion to Dismiss.[41]Molina filed supplemental pleadings to support her Motion to Dismiss, which were denied in the Order dated November 25, 1993.[42]Molina filed a Petition for Certiorari before this court, praying for the annulment of the Orders denying her Motion to Dismiss. She also prayed that this court dismiss the action for annulment filed by TMBC.[43]Molina filed the same Petition for Certiorari before the Court of Appeals on December 9, 1993.[44]IIIRuling in G.R. Nos. 109645 and 112564In the Decision dated July 25, 1994, this court granted Ortigas' Petition for Certiorari in G.R. No. 109645 and denied Molina's Petition in G.R. No. 112564. The dispositive portion of the Decision states:WHEREFORE, the petition in G.R. No. 109645 is GRANTED; and that in G.R. No. 112564[,] DENIED for lack of merit.In G.R. No. 109645, the Decision dated September 23, 1992 of Respondent Judge Tirso Velasco, Presiding Judge of Branch 88 of the Regional Trial Court of Quezon City, in LRC Case No. Q-5404, as well as his Orders dated April 3, 1992, October 14, 1992, and February 10, 1993, are NULLIFIED AND SET ASIDE; the titles of Dolores Molina upheld and reconstituted by said decision and orders \u2014 namely, Transfer Certificates of Title Numbered 124088 and RT-58287 \u2014 and those derived therefrom and subsequently issued \u2014 namely, Transfer Certificates of Title Numbered 83163, 83164, 83165, 83166 and 83167 \u2014 are all Declared NULL AND VOID and are hereby CANCELLED; said LRC Case No. Q-5404 of the Regional Trial Court of Quezon City is DISMISSED; and the temporary restraining order of this Court of May 12, 1993 is MADE PERMANENT.In G.R. No. 112564, the Orders of respondent Presiding Judge of Branch 105 of the Regional Trial Court of Quezon City in Case No. Q-93-15920 dated September 17, 1993 and November 25, 1993 are AFFIRMED; and said Judge is DIRECTED to proceed to dispose of said Case No. Q-93-15920 with all deliberate dispatch conformably with this decision.Dolores Molina and her counsel, Atty. Eufracio T. Layag, and Dr. Jose Teodorico V. Molina, are ORDERED to SHOW CAUSE, within ten (10) days from notice of this judgment, why they should not be pronounced liable, and correspondingly dealt with, for violation of the rule against forum-shopping.SO ORDERED.[45]This court explained that Judge Velasco had no jurisdiction to decide the reconstitution case since no notice was given to the owners of the adjacent properties.[46] This defect was in violation of Republic Act No. 26, Section 13.[47]In addition, Judge Velasco erred in reviving the case after Molina's Motion to Withdraw had been granted. This court discussed that:[t]he dismissal of the case, and the lapse of the reglementary period to reconsider or set aside the dismissal, effectively operated to remove the case from the Court's docket. Even assuming the dismissal to be without prejudice, the case could no longer be reinstated or \"revived\" by mere motion in the original docketed action, but only by the payment of the corresponding filing fees prescribed by law. . . . There having been a dismissal or withdrawal of the action, albeit without prejudice, and the order considering the action withdrawn having become final, revival of the case could not be done except through the commencement of a new action, i.e., by the filing of another complaint and the payment of the concomitant docketing fees.[48]As to Molina's claim of ownership, her contradictory statements proved otherwise. In this court's Decision, the following facts were noted:(1) In the WIDORA case, Molina claimed that she, together with her predecessors-in-interest, were in \"open, public, adverse, continuous and uninterrupted possession\"[49] of the property for more than 30 years. Subsequently, she claimed to have acquired the property through purchase from Eusebia Molina and her heirs.(2) As to possession of document of title, Molina claimed that when she purchased the property from Eusebia Molina, she had no time to attend to the property's titling since \"she was so preoccupied as the sole breadwinner of the family.\"[50] She later changed her story and claimed that she asked President Marcos to help her.[51] Next, she claimed that she was in possession of the owner's duplicate copy of TCT No. 124088.[52] She again changed her story and claimed that the owner's duplicate copy was not in her possession but she had \"a certification from the Land Management Bureau [and] that there [was] a record of her property in a microfilm negative.\"[53](3) The quitclaim and waiver she executed in favor of the Mormons was an \"implied recognition of Ortigas' ownership.\"[54](4) Jurisprudence shows that the validity of Ortigas' titles had been decided upon in several cases, namely:(a)Cia. Agricola de Ultramar v. Domingo[55](b) Ortigas v. Hon. Ruiz[56](c) Del Rosario v. Ortigas[57](d) Navarro v. Ortigas[58](e) Resolution dated August 7, 1992, where this court affirmed the Court of Appeals Decision in CA G.R. SP No. 18085.[59] The Court of Appeals stated that \"Widora and Molina had no more right to apply for the same lands which had already been titled in the name of Ortigas.\"[60]This court also held that Judge Velasco erred in dismissing the Notices of Appeal filed by Ortigas and the Office of the Solicitor General[61] and in granting Molina's Motion for Execution pending appeal.[62]The filing of numerous Petitions by Molina was noted, and this court held that she engaged in forum shopping. Thus, the dispositive portion of the Decision ordered her and her counsel to show cause why they should not be held in contempt.[63]Ortigas filed a Motion for Reconsideration on the ground that its prayer, \"that Hon. Judge Tirso D.C. Velasco be purged from the judiciary,\"[64] was not granted.On the other hand, Molina filed the Motion for Reconsideration dated August 10, 1994, and two supplements to the Motion dated September 22, 1994.[65] The Motion and the supplements were denied in the Resolution dated January 23, 1995. Thus, the Decision dated July 25, 1994 became final and executory for G.R. No. 112564 and G.R. No. 109645.[66]Also, the Resolution dated January 23, 1995 included the pronouncement that Dr. Teodorico Molina and counsel Atty. Eufracio Layag were \"guilty of contempt of court for willful violation of the rule against forum shopping.\"[67] A fine of P500.00 wasimposed on each of them.[68]Despite the denial of her Motion for Reconsideration, Molina still filed a \"Motion for Leave to File the Herein Incorporated Second Motion for Reconsideration and to Allow x x x Dolores V. Molina a Day in Court Relative to her Petition for Reconstitution.\"[69]The second Motion for Reconsideration was denied in the Resolution dated March 1, 1995. This court further resolved:TO DIRECT that no further pleadings, motions or papers be henceforth filed in these cases except only as regards the issues directly involved in the 'Motion for Reconsideration' (Re: Dismissal of Respondent Judge) of Ortigas & Co. Ltd., dated August 15, 1994.IT IS SO ORDERED.[70]In the Resolution dated July 24, 1995,[71] this court increased the fine imposed on Dr. Teodorico Molina and counsel Atty. Eufracio Layag to P1,000.00 and resolved:(2) To DECLARE THESE CASES CLOSED AND TERMINATED, DIRECT ENTRY OF JUDGMENT, AND REITERATE the direction 'that no further pleadings, motion or papers be henceforth filed in these cases except only as regards the issues directly involved in the Motion for Reconsideration (Re: Dismissal of Respondent Judge) of Ortigas & Co. Ltd., dated August 15, 1994' and the proceedings for contempt against Dr. Teodorico Molina and Atty. Eufracio Layag; and(3) To DIRECT the Clerk of Court to transmit the mittimus of both these cases to the corresponding Courts of origin for appropriate action and disposition.[72]Despite these Resolutions stating that \"no further pleadings, motions, or others papers\" be filed, Molina still filed the following:(a) [m]otion to refer the cases to the Court En Banc dated April 5, 1995 (denied by Resolution of June 19, 1995);(b) [consolidated motion dated July 25, 1995, for reconsideration of the June 19, 1995 Resolution (denied by Resolution dated August 28, 1995); and(c) [m]otion dated August 21, 1995 for reconsideration of the July 24, 1995 Resolution (Re: increasing fines on counsels and directing entry of judgment) (denied by Resolution dated October 25, 1995).\"[73]TMBC filed a Motion for Contempt[74] dated September 18, 1995, praying that Molina be declared in contempt of court and that her Motion for Reconsideration dated August 21, 1995 be denied.In the Resolution dated March 4, 1996,[75] this court found Molina guilty of contempt of court:It is clear that petitioner [Dolores V. Molina] was bent on pursuing her claims despite the Court's unequivocal declaration that her claims were lacking in merit, that the proceedings were terminated, and that no further pleadings, motions or papers should be filed. Her persistence constitutes a deliberate disregard, even defiance, of these Court's plain orders, and an abuse of the rules of procedure to delay the termination of these cases.Molina has had more than her day in court. She was accorded more than ample opportunity to present the merits of her case. Her every argument was heard and considered. . . . There has been a final determination of the issues in these cases and petitioner has been repeatedly directed to abide thereby. Her deliberate violation of the orders of the Court [is] unjustified and inexcusable.WHEREFORE, Dolores V. Molina is found GUILTY of contempt of court for willful disregard and disobedience of the Resolutions of the Court, and a FINE OF ONE THOUSAND PESOS (P1,000.00) is hereby imposed on her, payable within five (5) days from receipt of this Resolution, with the warning that any subsequent disregard and disobedience of this Court's orders will be dealt with more severely.Let this Resolution be published in the authorized Court reports for the information and guidance of the bench and the bar respecting the nature and effect of denials of motions for reconsideration of judgments and final orders, the propriety of second motions for reconsideration, and the prohibition against the filing of further pleadings, motions or other papers.IT IS SO ORDERED.[76] (Emphasis in the original)With regard to the Administrative Complaint against Judge Velasco, TMBC joined Ortigas in praying that he be-removed from the judiciary.[77]TMBC's Administrative Complaint against Judge Velasco was filed on July 12, 1993 ahead of Ortigas' Complaint and was docketed as Administrative Matter No. RTJ-93-1108.[78]In the Resolution dated August 15, 1997, this court held:WHEREFORE, Judge Tirso D. C. Velasco is hereby DISMISSED from the service, with forfeiture of all retirement benefits and accrued leave credits, and with prejudice to reemployment in any branch or instrumentality of the government including government-owned or controlled corporations. Immediately upon service on him of notice of this adjudgment, he shall be deemed to have VACATED his office and his authority to act in any manner whatsoever as Judge shall be considered to have automatically CEASED.SO ORDERED.[79] (Emphasis in the original)IVFacts of G.R. No. 128422Respondent Epimaco V. Oreta (Oreta) filed a Complaint against Molina for falsification of public document before the Office of the City Prosecutor in Quezon City. In his Affidavit-Complaint,[80] he stated that he is \"the Head of the Security Force hired to secure certain properties of The Manila Banking Corporation (TMBC)\"[81] and that he is the \"duly-appointed statutory receiver of TMBC.\"[82]Oreta alleged that TMBC owns several parcels of land in Greenmeadows, Quezon City. These parcels of land were purchased at public auctions due to the extrajudicial foreclosure of the mortgages over the lands.[83]The registered owners of the properties in dispute purchased the land from Ortigas.[84]The one-year redemption period expired, and none of the mortgagors exercised their right to redeem. Thus, \"TMBC executed various Affidavits of Consolidation of Ownership\"[85] and consolidated the titles to the properties.TMBC paid real estate taxes and transfer taxes relative to the sale and its consolidation of ownership.[86]In 1990, Molina filed \"a case for Damages with Prayer for Reconveyance and Preliminary Mandatory Injunction before Branch 88 of the Regional Trial Court of Quezon City[.]\"[87]Molina claimed that she owns \"[a] parcel of residential land situated at Ugong Norte, District of Cubao, Quezon City . . . containing an area of one hundred twenty six thousand two hundred seventy eight (126,278) square meters, more or less.\"[88]Molina also claimed that she purchased the property in 1939 from Eusebia Molina, Avelino P. Ramos, and Felix P. Micael.[89]However, Molina was unable to attend to the titling of the property because \"she was so preoccupied as the sole breadwinner of the family with children to support[.]\"[90]Several of the properties owned by TMBC overlapped with the properties being claimed by Molina.[91]Oreta presented documentary evidence to support his allegations:(1) Report of Atty. Benjamin Bustos,[92] Chief of the Reconstitution Division of the Land Registration Authority, a portion of which states:Psd-16740 appears to be derived from two different surveys, numbered Psu-1148 and Psu-20191; neither of which appear to have been the subject of original registration; thus it is presumed that no original title had been issued from which TCT-124088 could have emanated.[93](2) Report of Privadi Dalire, Chief, Geodetic Survey Division of the Land Management Bureau,[94] stating that:The procedures in the assignment of subdivision number is [sic] for each kind of subdivision covering a particular original survey such as the Psu survey. Since these two copies of Psd-16740, one covers Psu-1148 and the other Psu-20191 both for the same survey claimant and located in the same locality, and covered by same microfilm number gives rise to a questionable status of the documents.[95](3) Certification of Mr. Norberto B. Orense, Assistant Chief of the Ordinary Decree Division of the Land Registration Authority, stating that LRC Record No. 781:from which TCT No. 124088 allegedly emanated, pertains to a land registration case in the province of Palawan from which was issued Decree No. 2827 on 28 February 1908. Furthermore, it was likewise certified that Molina's alleged plans Psu-Nos. 1148 (also appearing on the face of the alleged TCT No. 124088) and 20191 are not subject of any land registration proceedings.[96](4) Certification of Ms. Carmelita Labrador, Administrative Officer V of the Land Registration Authority, stating that the control number on Molina's TCT No. 124088 was issued on February 12, 1975, whereas Molina's TCT was issued on October 30, 1967.[97]Oreta further alleged that because of the issuance of TCT No. RT-58287[98] and the subsequent issuance of TCT Nos. 83163, 83165, and 83167,[99] an Information for coercion and other forms of trespass was filed against him.[100] However, the basis of the charge against him was a false document. Thus, he prays that Molina \"be prosecuted for the crime of falsification of public document [under Article 171 and 172 of the Revised Penal Code.]\"[101]Molina filed a Counter-affidavit, stating that she and her husband, Pio Molina, had been in possession of the land covered by TCT No. 124088 since 1939.[102]In September 1991, TCT No. 124088 was lost \"and unfortunately, the original thereof on file with the Registry of Deeds for Quezon City was also lost or destroyed due to fire that gutted the said office[.]\"[103] Molina claimed that she went to the Land Registration Authority to inquire where she could find a copy of TCT No. 124088. She found a microfilm negative of TCT No. 124088, which the Land Registration Authority found to be correct. Further, the existence of Psd-16740 was proven by Mr. Armando Bangayan, Assistant Chief, Records Division, Land Management Bureau.[104]Molina questioned Oreta's authority to file the Affidavit-Complaint.[105]In the Resolution dated July 21, 1994,[106] Assistant City Prosecutor Eduardo D. Resurreccion recommended the dismissal of the case.[107]Oreta filed a Motion for Reconsideration, which was denied by Second Assistant City Prosecutor Rogelio U. Concepcion in the Resolution dated November 11, 1994.[108]Oreta filed a Petition for Review[109] before the Department of Justice.Oreta pointed out that TCT No. 124088 was declared null and void by this court.[110] He also pointed out that the alleged microfilm negative of Psd-16740 was never presented by Molina.[111]With regard to the certification of the Land Management Bureau that the microfilm negative was not falsified, Oreta pointed out that the certification referred to Psd-16740 and not TCT No. 124088.[112]Molina filed a Comment,[113] citing Judge Velasco's Decision ordering the reconstitution of TCT No. 124088[114] and arguing that Oreta's Complaint had no basis.[115]Chief State Prosecutor Zenon L. De Guia reversed the Resolution of the City Prosecutor and directed the filing of \"an information for falsification of public document\" in the Resolution dated April 18, 1996.[116]Molina filed a Motion for Reconsideration with Manifestation to File Documents.[117] This was denied by then Secretary of Justice Teofisto T. Guingona, Jr. (Secretary Guingona, Jr.) in the Resolution dated November 29, 1996.[118]Undaunted, Molina filed a Petition for Review on Certiorari[119] before the Court of Appeals.In her Petition, Molina raises the following issue:Whether the circumstances that [envelop] this case constitute either the offense of falsification of public documents or use of falsified document in a judicial proceeding?[120]Molina imputes grave abuse of discretion on the part of the Department of Justice when it directed the filing of an Information for Falsification of Public Document against her.[121]The Court of Appeals dismissed Molina's Petition on technical grounds. The Court of Appeals Resolution dated February 4, 1997 states:It appearing that petitioner failed to submit the certified true copies of the assailed Resolutions dated April 18, 1996 and November 29, 1996, the instant petition for review is hereby DISMISSED outright pursuant to Supreme Court Circular No. 3-96 and Section 3(b) and 3(d)(l), Rule 6 of the Revised Internal Rules of this Court.SO ORDERED.[122]Molina filed a Motion for Reconsideration and to Admit Original Certified True Copies of Annexes \"J\" and \"K-l\" to the Petition.[123] She claimed that she complied with Supreme Court Circular No. 3-96 and Section 3(b) of the Revised Internal Rules of the Court of Appeals, but due to inadvertence, the \"original certified true copies of the assailed resolutions . . . [were] not attached to the original copy of the petition but to one of the ten (10) duplicates thereof.\"[124]The Motion for Reconsideration was denied in the Resolution dated March 11, 1997.[125]The Court of Appeals found that contrary to Molina's assertion that she filed 10 duplicate copies, only four were filed.[126] Of the four duplicate copies, none included the \"duplicate original or certified true copy of the assailed Resolutions.\"[127] Gabionza v. Court of Appeals,[128] cited by her, is not applicable because there was substantial compliance with the rules of procedure in that case.[129]From the denial of her Motion for Reconsideration, Molina filed a Petition for Review on Certiorari[130] before this court.V Facts of G.R. No. 128911On January 7, 1997, Molina filed an action for quieting of title and annulment of title before the Regional Trial Court of Quezon City. The subject of the complaint was parcels of land covered by TCT Nos. 83163, 83164, 83165, and 83167. These titles were declared null and void by this court in G.R. No. 109645 and G.R. No. 112564.[131]The action for quieting of title was docketed as Civil Case No. Q-97-29856.[132] Molina then moved that the case be consolidated with Civil Case No. Q-93-15920, which was a Petition for Annulment of Title.[133]TMBC filed a Motion to Dismiss Civil Case No. Q-97-29856, citing res judicata, conclusiveness of judgment, bar by prior judgment, and forum shopping. In addition, the Regional Trial Court cannot annul and set aside the Decision of this court.[134]Molina opposed the Motion to Dismiss.[135] Subsequently, she filed a 'With Leave Motion to Admit Amended Complaint' dated February 24, 1997.[136]TMBC and Alberto V. Reyes (Reyes)[137] opposed Molina's Motion. However, the trial court admitted the Amended Complaint and did not act on TMBC's Motion to Dismiss. The trial court's Order dated March 18, 1997 reads as follows:Before this Court are the following:Supplement to Complaint dated January 21, 1997TMBC Motion to DismissBangko Sentral ng Pilipinas Motion to DismissTMBC Motion to Strike Off and/or Dismiss Ad Cautelam Supplement to Complaint dated January 21, 1997 with the respective comments/oppositions thereto.Considering that it is undisputed that TMBC is under receivership, the Motion to Dismiss filed by Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas is hereby granted. This case is dismissed as against Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas, it appearing that Alberto Reyes is the receiver and not the said bank.Accordingly, the Motion to Admit Amended Complaint with leave is hereby granted, and the amended complaint attached thereto wherein TMBC is dropped as party-defendant and in lieu thereof, Alberto Reyes is impleaded as such is admitted.Let summons be served on the newly named defendant.There is no need to act on TMBC's motion to dismiss given the above circumstances.SO ORDERED.[138]TMBC and Reyes filed a Motion for Reconsideration, which was denied.[139]TMBC and Reyes filed this Joint Petition for Certiorari and Prohibition with prayer for the issuance of a writ of preliminary injunction/temporary restraining order.[140]TMBC and Reyes argue that:[p]ublic respondent Judge should have dismissed private respondent Molina's Complaint dated 06 January 1997 considering that on its face, it is clear that he has no jurisdiction to take cognizance of the same as it prays for the court a quo to annul and set aside the final and executory decisions of the Honorable Court and the Court of Appeals adjudicating in favor of petitioner TMBC the ownership and possession of the subject properties, subject matter of the private respondent Molina's Complaint and Amended Complaint.[141]TMBC and Reyes also cite this court's Decisions in the other cases involving Molina.[142] They point out that Molina's Complaint and Amended Complaint should have been dismissed outright for being a clear case of forum shopping.[143]VI Procedural developmentIn G.R. No. 128422, this court granted the Motion for Extension of Time to file Petition for Certiorari and required respondents to comment.[144]Oreta filed a Motion to Consolidate[145] G.R. No. 128422 with G.R. Nos. 109645 and 112564. The Motion to Consolidate was granted in the Resolution dated July 23, 1997.[146]In G.R. No. 128911, TMBC and Reyes filed a Motion to Consolidate[147] their Petition with G.R. Nos. 109645 and 112564.[148]Molina filed an Opposition to the Motion to Consolidate.[149]In the Resolution dated May 28, 1997, this court granted the Motion to Consolidate.[150]Molina filed a Motion for Reconsideration regarding the consolidation of the cases.[151]In the Resolution dated June 23, 1997,[152] this court noted the following:(a) The manifestation filed by TMBC stating that more than two years after the decision in G.R. No. 109645 and G.R. No. 112564 was promulgated, the trial court where Civil Case No. Q-93-15920 is pending had yet to act on TMBC's application for writ of preliminary injunction;(b) Counter-manifestation filed by Molina;(c) Opposition to the motion to consolidate; and(d) Required respondents to comment on the petition for certiorari in G.R. No. 128911.[153]TMBC and Reyes filed an Opposition to Molina's Motion for Reconsideration dated 16 June 1997.[154]On August 7, 1997, TMBC and Reyes filed a Manifestation and Urgent Motion to Resolve [Application for Issuance of a Temporary Restraining Order and/or Writ of Preliminary Injunction].[155]TMBC and Reyes argue that in Ortigas & Company Limited Partnership v. Velasco,[156] this court ordered that Civil Case No. Q-93-15920 be disposed with deliberate dispatch. Civil Case No. Q-97-29856 was consolidated with Civil Case No. Q-93-15920. Thus, Judge Marciano Bacalla's (Judge Bacalla) cognizance of Civil Case No. Q-97-29856 in effect delayed the disposition of Civil Case No. Q-93-15920.[157]TMBC and Reyes also argue that:[p]ublic respondent Judge Bacalla's acts of assuming jurisdiction over Civil Case No. Q-97-29856 and conducting proceedings in said case shall deprive petitioners of their unquestionable right to execute the previous final and executory judgments promulgated by the Court of Appeals and the Honorable Court declaring with finality petitioner TMBC's absolute title and right to possess the Subject Properties. To compel petitioners to defend once again petitioner TMBC's absolute title and right to the Subject Properties would evidently result in a grave injustice.[158]In the Resolution dated August 11, 1997, Molina's Motion for Extension to File Comment was granted, and TMBC's Manifestation dated July 31, 1997 in G.R. No. 128911, \"stating that the pretended issue on the real party in interest in Civil Cases Nos. Q-93-15920 and Q-97-29856[,] has already been rendered moot and academic with the effectivity of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure.\"[159]In the Resolution dated September 3, 1997,[160] this court noted the following:(a) In G.R. No. 128911: (i) TMBC's Manifestation and Urgent Motion to resolve the application for issuance of a temporary restraining order and/or writ of preliminary injunction dated August 5, 1997; and (ii) Comment filed by Dolores Molina.(b) In G.R. No. 128422: (i) Comment filed by Oreta; (ii) Reply filed by Molina; and (iii) Granted the Motion for Leave to File Rejoinder to Reply.Oreta filed the Motion for Further Extension of Time to File Rejoinder[161] dated September 4, 1997. He subsequently filed a Motion to Admit (Rejoinder dated 09 September 1997)[162] and attached a copy of the Rejoinder.[163]In the Resolution dated September 10, 1997,[164] this court issued a temporary restraining order in favor of TMBC stating as follows:Premises considered, therefore, and pending determination of the proceeding at bar, the Court Resolved to ISSUE A TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER upon a bond in the sum of Ten Thousand Pesos (P10,000.00) to be posted by petitioner, The Manila Banking Corporation (TMBC):(1) COMMANDING the Presiding Judge of Branch 216 of the Regional Trial Court at Quezon City, Judge Marciano Bacalla, to FORTHWITH CEASE AND DESIST from proceeding with and acting on Civil Case No. Q-97-29856, and to PROCEED to hear and resolve the issue of damages in Civil Case No. Q-93-15920 and such others as arise from the pleadings, absolutely and scrupulously excluding any claim of ownership of Dolores Molina over the property in question which claim has, as aforestated, been finally declared entirely spurious conformably with this Court's Decision of July 24, 1994 and Resolution of August 15, 1997; and(2) PROHIBITING Dolores V. Molina, her children, assigns or successors in interest, or their counsel, from ventilating and litigating in any guise, manner, shape, or form said Molina's claim of title over the lands involved in any of the actions and proceedings at bar, or in any other action or proceeding[.][165]In the same Resolution,[166] this court issued a Show Cause Order to Molina and Judge Bacalla, stating as follows:The Court further Resolved to DENY the motion to dismiss incorporated in respondent Molina's comment dated August 4, 1997, and to ORDER:1) DOLORES V. MOLINA to SHOW CAUSE, within ten (10) days from notice of this Resolution, why she should not be held in contempt of court for forum shopping and otherwise disregarding and defying the judgment of July 24, 1994 and resolutions of this Court in G.R. Nos. 109645 and 112564 (234 SCRA 455); and JUDGE MARCIANO BACALLA, to EXPLAIN within the same period why he has taken and is taking cognizance of Molina's allegation and claim of ownership despite his attention having been drawn to the aforesaid judgment.[167]TMBC subsequently filed a Manifestation and Motion [To Partially Withdraw the Joint Petition dated 07 May 1997].[168]TMBC informed this court that Judge Bacalla ordered the withdrawal of Civil Case No. Q-97-29856 from his docket[169] and also ordered that Molina's \"patently sham and dilatory pleadings\"[170] be stricken off the records of Civil Case No. Q-93-15920. Thus, TMBC's prayer for injunctive reliefs in the Petition for Certiorari, related to Civil Case No. Q-97-29856, is moot and academic.[171] However, TMBC maintains its other prayers for relief, specifically:6.1. The issuance of a temporary restraining order and/or writ of preliminary injunction against private respondent Molina and her alleged representatives, counsel and successors-in-interest from filing pleadings asserting her baseless claims of ownership and possession over the properties subject matter of the Joint Petition dated 07 May 1997;6.2. The promulgation of a resolution and/or judgment citing private respondent Molina and her counsel, Atty. Cesar Turiano in contempt of court for the contumacious acts of forum shopping, abuse of court processes, deliberate disobedience of formal orders, resolutions and decisions of the Honorable Court and obstruction of the orderly administration [of] justice; and imposing disciplinary sanctions on private respondent Molina's counsel, Atty. Cesar Turiano, for violations of the Lawyer's Oath and the Code of Professional Responsibility and the final and executory decisions rendered by the Honorable Court set forth in the Joint Petition dated 07 May 1997.[172]From the records, this court issued the Resolution dated October 1, 1997 granting the Motions for Extension of Time to File Rejoinder filed by counsel of Oreta in G.R. No. 128422 and the Motion to Admit Rejoinder. In the same Resolution, this court noted Oreta's Rejoinder, the Manifestation and Motion of TMBC in G.R. No. 128911 partially withdrawing the Joint Petition, and \"the [E]ntry of [A]ppearance[173] of Atty. Napoleon Uy Galit\" as counsel for Molina in G.R. No. 128911.[174]VIIIssuesIn G.R. No. 128422, Molina raises the following issues:(1) Whether this Honorable Supreme Court is bound by the conclusion of the Honorable Court of Appeals, which, in effect deprive[d] [Dolores V. Molina's] right to appeal[;] [and](2) Whether [Dolores V. Molina's] failure to comply strictly with the requirements in appealing a decision is enough to deprive her of her right to appeal.[175]In G.R. No. 128911, TMBC and Reyes filed a Motion partially withdrawing their Petition. Thus, the remaining issues for resolution are as follows:(1) Whether there are grounds to issue a temporary restraining order/writ of preliminary injunction to put an end to Dolores V. Molina's continuous filing of pleadings involving her \"baseless claims of ownership and possession\"[176] over TMBC's properties; and(2) Whether there are grounds to cite Dolores V. Molina and her counsel, Atty. Cesar Turiano,[177] and Judge Marciano Bacalla in contempt of court.VIIIArguments of the partiesG.R. No. 128422Molina argues that contrary to the Court of Appeals Resolution, copies of the certified true copy of the assailed Letter-Resolution were attached as Annex \"J\" and Annex \"K-l\" to the Petition,[178] except that the original copies were attached to the copies sent to the Department of Justice and Quezon City Prosecutor's Office.[179] This mistake was the fault of Molina's counsel's office secretary and should be considered as an \"honest mistake, inadvertence and oversight.\"[180]Molina points out that since copies of the assailed Letter-Resolution were attached to the Petitions filed before the Court of Appeals, she should be considered as having substantially complied with SC Administrative Circular No. 3-96 and Section 3(b) and (d) of the Revised Internal Rules of the Court of Appeals.[181]Molina further argues that the procedural infirmity in the filing of her Petition is not \"enough to deprive [her] of her right to appeal.\"[182] Hence, the dismissal of her Petition is a violation of her right to due process.[183]On the other hand, Oreta argues that Molina's Petition is a dilatory tactic. An alias warrant of arrest was issued against Molina after she had failed to appear at her scheduled arraignment.[184]Molina's Petition may appear to raise procedural issues only. However, if this court grants her Petition, she would be allowed to relitigate her claim based on TCT No. 124088.[185]Oreta cites the principles of \"res judicata, conclusiveness of judgment and bar by prior judgment.\"[186] He also cites Section 47 of Rule 39 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure:[187]Section 47. Effect of judgments or final orders. \u2014 The effect of a judgment or final order rendered by a court of the Philippines, having jurisdiction to pronounce the judgment or final order, may be as follows:(a) In case of a judgment or final order against a specific thing, or in respect to the probate of a will, or the administration of the estate of a deceased person, or in respect to the personal, political, or legal condition or status of a particular person or his relationship to another, the judgment or final order is conclusive upon the title to the thing, the will or administration or the condition, status or relationship of the person, however, the probate of a will or granting of letters of administration shall only be prima facie evidence of the death of the testator or intestate;(b) In other cases, the judgment or final order is, with respect to the matter directly adjudged or as to any other matter that could have been missed in relation thereto, conclusive between the parties and their successors in interest, by title subsequent to the commencement of the action or special proceeding, litigating for the same thing and under the same title and in the same capacity; and(c) In any other litigation between the same parties or their successors in interest, that only is deemed to have been adjudged in a former judgment or final order which appears upon its face to have been so adjudged, or which was actually and necessarily included therein or necessary thereto. (49a)Molina has not shown any justifiable or compelling reasons why the Court of Appeals Resolution should be set aside.[188]Since an Information against Molina was filed and docketed as Criminal Case No. 62889 before Branch 31 of the Metropolitan Trial Court of Quezon City, she \"can no longer ask for the review of the finding of a prima facie case by the DOJ against her considering that she has failed to obtain prior leave from said court.\"[189]Oreta points out that the Metropolitan Trial Court acquired jurisdiction over the case when the Information was filed.[190] Molina is considered a \"fugitive from justice\" since she did not appear at her scheduled arraignment.[191]In her Reply,[192] Molina argues that although this court declared TCT No. 124088 null and void, \"it does not necessarily mean that it is falsified.\"[193] She also denies that she intends to relitigate her claim of ownership based on TCT No. 124088.[194]Molina denies forestalling her prosecution by filing this Petition for Review. She then reiterates her argument that she substantially complied with Circular 3-96 and the Revised Internal Rules of the Court of Appeals.[195]Oreta filed a Rejoinder[196] stating that the prosecutor's finding of probable cause to believe that Molina falsified a public document does not mean that she is guilty. Her proper remedy is to present her evidence during trial, and not to file a Petition for Review.[197]G.R. No. 128911TMBC and Reyes cite Supreme Court Administrative Circular No. 04-94, the pertinent portion of which states:2. Any violation of this Circular shall be a cause for the dismissal of the complaint, petition, application or other initiatory pleading, upon motion and after hearing. However, any clearly willful and deliberate forum shopping by any party and his counsel through the filing of multiple complaints or other initiatory pleadings to obtain favorable action shall be a ground for summary dismissal thereof and shall constitute direct contempt of court. Furthermore, the submission of a false certification or non-compliance with the undertakings therein, as provided in Paragraph 1 hereof, shall constitute indirect contempt of court, without prejudice to disciplinary proceedings against the counsel and the filing of a criminal action against the guilty party[.][198]Ownership over the properties has been decided and passed upon with finality in the following cases: Ortigas & Company Limited Partnership v. Judge Tirso Velasco and Dolores V. Molina,[199] Dolores V. Molina v. Hon. Presiding Judge of RTC, Quezon City, Br. 105 and Manila Banking Corporation,[200] Dolores V. Molina and Aproniano L. Timbol v. Court of Appeals and Epimaco V. Oreta,[201] Epimaco V. Oreta v. Hon. George Macli-ing, in his capacity as Presiding Judge of the Regional Trial Court of Quezon City, Branch 100, and Dolores V. Molina and Aproniano L. Timbol.[202]Despite these Decisions, Molina still filed a Complaint for quieting of title[203] and an Amended Complaint.[204]TMBC and Reyes also point out that Molina submitted a false verification and certification in her Complaint and Amended Complaint when she stated under oath the following:That I hereby certify that I have not commenced any other action or proceeding involving the same issues between the same parties in the Supreme Court, the Court of Appeals, or divisions thereof or any other quasi-judicial body and I undertake to inform this Honorable Court of such fact within five (5) days from knowledge thereof.[205]Molina never informed this court of the previous Decisions declaring her titles null and void.[206]In her Comment,[207] Molina explained that after she had filed an action for quieting of title docketed as Civil Case No. Q-97-29856, TMBC filed a Motion to Dismiss and to Strike Off and/or Dismiss Ad Cautelam Supplement to Complaint on the ground that the issue of ownership had been decided by this court.[208]She filed an Amended Complaint when she found out that TMBC was under receivership. The Amended Complaint dropped TMBC as a party and included the Central Bank as the proper party.[209]The Central Bank also moved to dismiss the Amended Complaint since TMBC's duly appointed receiver was Reyes.[210]The trial court issued the Order dated March 18, 1997, granting the Motion to Admit Amended Complaint, dropping TMBC as a party, and impleading Reyes.[211]TMBC filed a Motion for Reconsideration but was denied in the Order dated April 23, 1997.[212]Molina argues that the trial court did not rule upon the merits of her case but only resolved who the real party in interest was.[213]Molina further argues that the delays in the resolution of Civil Case No. Q-97-29856 were due to TMBC's failure to file its responsive pleading. In addition, TMBC should have filed its Answer instead of a Petition for Certiorari when the trial court denied TMBC's Motion to Dismiss.[214]This court now rules as follows:G.R. No. 128422The Court of Appeals erred in dismissing the Petition on procedural grounds. Nevertheless, we affirm the Court of Appeals Resolutions dated February 4, 1997[215] and March 11, 1997[216] on the ground that Molina availed herself of the wrong remedy.Section 3(b) and Section 3(d)(l) of the Revised Internal Rules of the Court of Appeals, which were in force when Molina filed her Petition for Review before the Court of Appeals, provides:Section 3. Petitions for Review. - Within the period to appeal, the petitioner shall file a verified petition in seven (7) legible copies and (1) one copy thereof shall be served on each of the respondents. Upon proper motion presented before the expiration of the original reglementary period, the Court may grant a non-extendible additional period of fifteen (15) days save in exceptionally meritorious cases within which to file the petition for review; Provided, however, that should there be no petition filed within the extended period, the case shall be dismissed. A petition filed after the period shall be denied due course outright. The Regional Trial Court shall be furnished a copy of the resolution to this effect.b. What should be filed. - The petition shall be accompanied by a certified true copy of the disputed decisions, judgments, or orders, of the lower courts, together with true copies of the pleadings and other material portions of the record as would support the allegations of the petition.d. Judicial action. - The Court may dismiss the petition, or require the private respondent to comment on the petition, or give it due course.(1) If the petition is not prima facie sufficient in form and substance, the Court may dismiss it outright stating the reasons therefor. If instead of a petition for review, the appellant perfects his appeal pursuant to Rule 41 of the Rules of Court, it shall nevertheless be dismissed even if the Regional Trial Court had given it due course.Supreme Court Administrative Circular No. 3-96[217] dated April 17, 1996 provides:1. The \"duplicate original copy\" shall be understood to be that copy of the decision, judgement, resolution or order which is intended for and furnished to a party in the case or proceeding in the court or adjudicative body which rendered and issued the same. The \"certified true copy\" thereof shall be such other copy furnished to a party at his instance or in his behalf, duly authenticated by the authorized officers or representatives or the issuing entity as hereinbefore specified.3. The certified true copy must further comply with all the regulations therefor of the issuing entity and it is the authenticated original of such certified true copy, and not a mere xerox copy thereof, which shall be utilized as an annex to the petition or other initiatory pleading.4. Regardless of whether a duplicate original copy or a certified true copy of the adjudicatory document is annexed to the petition or initiatory pleading, the same must be an exact and complete copy of the original, and all the pages thereof must be clearly legible and printed on white bond or equivalent paper of good quality with the same dimensions as the original copy. Either of the aforesaid copies shall be annexed to the original copy of the petition or initiatory pleading filed in court, while plain copies thereof may be attached to the other copies of the pleading.5. It shall be the duty and responsibility of the party using the documents required by Paragraph (3) of Circular No. 1-88 to verify and ensure compliance with all the requirements therefor as detailed in the preceding paragraphs. Failure to do so shall result in the rejection of such annexes and the dismissal of the case. Subsequent compliance shall not warrant any reconsideration unless the court is fully satisfied that the non-compliance was not in any way attributable to the party, despite due diligence on his part and that there are highly justifiable and compelling reasons for the court to make such other disposition as it may deem just and equitable.In Donato v. Court of Appeals,[218] this court held that:[i]n like manner, the failure of the petitioner to comply with Section 3, paragraph b, Rule 6 of the RIRCA, that is, to append to his petition copies of the pleadings and other material portions of the records as would support the petition, does not justify the outright dismissal of the petition. It must be emphasized that the RIRCA gives the appellate.court a certain leeway to require parties to submit additional documents as may be necessary in the interest of substantial justice. Under Section 3, paragraph d of Rule 3 of the RIRCA, the CA may require the parties to complete the annexes as the court deems necessary, and if the petition is given due course, the CA may require the elevation of a complete record of the case as provided for under Section 3(d)(5) of Rule 6 of the RIRCA. At any rate, petitioner attached copies of the pleadings and other material portions of the records below with his motion for reconsideration.[219]The ruling in Donato was subsequently cited in Mendoza v. David[220] and Valdecantos v. People[221] stating that the submission of the required pleadings and attachments in the Motion for Reconsideration was deemed substantial compliance.In this case, the Court of Appeals admitted that Molina tried to rectify her mistake. A portion of the Resolution dated March 11, 1997 states:In the case at bar, the petition lacks the required certified true copy or duplicate original of the assailed Resolutions which is clearly an omission violative of the rules. The fact that petitioner in the instant motion has attached the certified true copy of the assailed Resolutions will not cure the defect. Pursuant to Paragraph 5 of Administrative Circular No. 3-96, subsequent compliance shall not warrant any reconsideration.[222] (Emphasis supplied)Thus, the Court of Appeals erred in dismissing Molina's Petition for Review on procedural grounds.However, we affirm the dismissal of Molina's Petition based on other grounds.Prior to the filing of the Information, Molina had filed a Motion for Reconsideration of the Resolution dated April 18, 1996, which Resolution directed the City Prosecutor to file an Information against her.[223] The records show that the Information against Molina was filed on May 27, 1996.[224] Her Petition for Review before the Court of Appeals was filed on January 16, 1997.[225]In other words, while the trial court had acquired jurisdiction over the case, Molina pursued another remedy, specifically, a review of the City Prosecutor's finding of probable cause.In Crespo v. Judge Mogul:[226][t]he rule therefore in this jurisdiction is that once a complaint or information is filed in Court any disposition of the case as its dismissal or the conviction or acquittal of the accused rests in the sound discretion of the Court. Although the fiscal retains the direction and control of the prosecution of criminal cases even while the case is already in Court he cannot impose his opinion on the trial court. The Court is the best and sole judge on what to do with the case before it. The determination of the case is within its exclusive jurisdiction and competence. A motion to dismiss the case filed by the fiscal should be addressed to the Court who has the option to grant or deny the same. It does not matter if this is done before or after the arraignment of the accused or that the motion was filed after a reinvestigation or upon instructions of the Secretary of Justice who reviewed the records of the investigation.In order therefor to avoid such a situation whereby the opinion of the Secretary of Justice who reviewed the action of the fiscal may be disregarded by the trial court, the Secretary of Justice should, as far as practicable, refrain from entertaining a petition for review or appeal from the action of the fiscal, when the complaint or information has already been filed in Court. The matter should be left entirely for the determination of the Court.[227]The ruling in Crespo was clarified in Chan v. Formaran III, et al.[228]In subsequent cases, the Court clarified that Crespo does not bar the Justice Secretary from reviewing the findings of the investigating prosecutor in the exercise of his power of control over his subordinates. The Justice Secretary is merely advised, as far as practicable, to refrain from entertaining a petition for review of the prosecutor's finding when the Information is already filed in court. In other words, the power or authority of the Justice Secretary to review the prosecutor's findings subsists even after the Information is filed in court. The court, however, is not bound by the Resolution of the Justice Secretary, but must evaluate it before proceeding with the trial. While the ruling of the Justice Secretary is persuasive, it is not binding on courts.[229]Chan v. Formaran III, et al. also discussed that the proper remedy to review the Resolutions of the Secretary of Justice was the filing of a Petition for Certiorari under Rule 65.[230] It was further discussed that:[a]lbeit the findings of the Justice Secretary are not absolute and are subject to judicial review, this Court generally adheres to the policy of non-interference in the conduct of preliminary investigations, particularly when the said findings are well-supported by the facts as established by the evidence on record. Absent any showing of arbitrariness on the part of the prosecutor or any other officer authorized to conduct preliminary investigation, courts as a rule must defer to said officer's finding and determination of probable cause, since the determination of the existence of probable cause is the function of the prosecutor. Simply stated, findings of the Secretary of Justice are not subject to review, unless made with grave abuse of discretion.[231]Thus, the Court of Appeals did not err in dismissing Molina's Petition.In any case, a review of the records shows that no grave abuse of discretion can be attributed to Secretary Guingona, Jr. when he affirmed the findings of Chief State Prosecutor Zenon L. De Guia (Chief State Prosecutor De Guia).Chief State Prosecutor De Guia, acting on the Petition for Review filed by Oreta, directed the City Prosecutor in Quezon City \"to file an information for falsification of public document against respondent Dolores V. Molina.\"[232] He discussed the following:Contrary to your finding, the issue in this case is not whether respondent's reconstituted title may be considered as a falsified document but whether or not respondent used a fictitious and non-existent title, TCT No. 124088, in support of her application for reconstitution of title.We have gone over the record and we find that the evidence presented by complainant supports a finding that respondent's photocopy of TCT No. 124088 was simulated and given the appearance of authenticity. Several certifications and testimonies from personnel of the Land Registration Authority and the Register of Deeds of Quezon City attest to the fact that the entries in said photocopy of TCT No. 124088 are fictitious and totally inconsistent with the record on file. In fact, in the cases of Ortigas and Company Limited Partnership vs. Judge Tirso Velasco and Dolores Molina, G.R. No. 109645; and Dolores Molina vs. Hon. Presiding Judge of RTC, Quezon City, Branch 108 and Manila Banking Corporation, G.R. No. 112564, jointly resolved and promulgated on July 25, 1994, the Supreme Court declared null and void the reconstituted title of respondent and expressly found respondent guilty of forum shopping by filing cases one after another in order to obtain a judgment in her favor upholding her claim to the subject lands. These facts support a prima facie finding that respondent presented a falsified transfer certificate of title to support her application for reconstitution of title.[233]Molina filed a Motion for Reconsideration, which was denied in a Letter-Resolution dated November 29, 1996. Secretary Guingona, Jr. explained:After an examination of your motion, we find no compelling reason to justify an amendment or reversal of our earlier ruling. Your allegations as to the authenticity and genuineness of TCT No. 124088 have earlier been considered and passed upon by this Office. We reiterate that respondent's documentary evidence can not [sic] be given greater weight than the documentary evidence submitted by complainant which proves that the entries in TCT No. 124088 are spurious. The conflicting evidence submitted by both parties is best left for the court to determine in a full[-]blown trial. Suffice it to say that the evidence warrants a finding that the crime of falsification may have been committed and that respondent is responsible therefor.[234]Chief State Prosecutor De Guia's Resolution extensively discussed why probable cause existed to file an Information against Molina. He sufficiently explained the reason why he reversed the finding of the City Prosecutor. Clearly, no grave abuse of discretion can be attributed to Secretary Guingona, Jr. when he denied Molina's Motion for Reconsideration.This court reminds Molina of the discussion in Punzalan v. Plata:[235][T]he Court considers it a sound judicial policy to refrain from interfering in the conduct of preliminary investigations and to leave the DOJ a wide latitude of discretion in the determination of what constitutes sufficient evidence to establish probable cause for the prosecution of the supposed offenders. The rule is based not only upon the respect for the investigatory and prosecutor powers granted by the Constitution to the executive department but upon practicality as well.[236]G.R. No. 128911In the Resolution dated September 10, 1997,[237] this court issued a temporary restraining order and made the following pronouncements:In its Decision dated July 24, 1994 in the consolidated cases of G.R. No. 109645 and G.R. No. 112564 (234 SCRA 455), this Court pertinently ruled that:\"Ordinarily, the relief indicated by the material facts would be the remand of the reconstitution case (LRC No. Q-. 5404 [instituted by petitioner Molina]) to the Court of origin with instructions that Ortigas' and the Solicitor General's appeals from the judgment rendered therein, which were wrongly disallowed, be given due course and the records forthwith transmitted to the appellate tribunal. This, in fact, is a relief alternatively prayed for by petitioner Ortigas. Considering however the fatal infirmities afflicting Molina's theory or cause of action, evident from the records before this Court, such a remand and subsequent appeal proceedings would be pointless and unduly circuitous. Upon the fact, it is not possible for Molina's cause to prosper. To defer adjudication thereon would be unwarranted and unjust.(T)he titles of Dolores Molina upheld and reconstituted by said decision (in LRC Case No. Q-54040 [sic] and others \u2014 namely Transfer Certificates of Title Numbered 124088 and RT-58287 \u2014 and those derived therefrom and subsequently issued namely, Transfer Certificates of Title Numbered 83163, 83164, 83165, 832166 [sic] and 83167 \u2014 are all declared NULL AND VOID and are hereby CANCELLED; said LRC Case No. Q-5404 of the Regional Trial Court of Quezon City is DISMISSED; and the temporary restraining order of this Court of May 12, 1993 is MADE PERMANENT.In G.R. No. 112564, the Orders of respondent Presiding Judge of Branch 105 of the Regional Trial Court of Quezon City in Case No. Q-93-15920 dated September 17, 1993 and November 25, 1993 are AFFIRMED; and said Judge is DIRECTED to proceed to dispose of said Case No. Q-93-15920 with all deliberate dispatch conformably with this decision\"The case above referred to, No. Q-93-15920, was instituted in the Regional Trial Court of Quezon City by The Manila Banking Corporation (TMBC) against Dolores V. Molina and Gateway Enterprises Company, Inc., essentially praying for annulment of Molina's title (and others derived therefrom) and for damages. The plain import of this Court's directions in said judgment of July 24, 1994 \u2014 that \"said Judge ** proceed to dispose of said Case No. Q-93-15920 with all deliberate dispatch conformably with this decision\" \u2014 is that the Judge should resolve the issue of damages only; NOT that he should allow re-litigation of, and rehear again and pass upon, Molina's claim of adverse title which conformably with this (Court's) decision, is bereft of any merit whatever. The spuriousness of Molina's claim of ownership having already been adjudged definitively, authoritatively, and finally, that claim should not and could not be legitimate subject of any subsequent action or proceeding in any court, regardless of the guise, manner or form in which it might later be presented.Now, it appears that Dolores Molina has instituted a new action in the Regional Trial Court of Quezon City, for quieting of title, docketed as Q-97-29856. In this case, she alleged ownership of the land described in Certificates of Title Nos. 83163, 83164, 83165, 832166 [sic] and 83167 which are the very same titles, already declared fictitious and worthless in this Court's judgment of July 24, 1994; and she has succeeded in consolidating said Case No. Q-97-29856 with Case No. Q-93-15920, pending before Branch 216 of the Quezon City RTC, presided over by Judge Marciano Bacalla. It further appears that Judge Bacalla is disposed to take cognizance of and allow ventilation of the action involving Molina's aforesaid fake titles; this, over the opposition of TMBC which insists that Case No. Q-97-29856 be summarily dismissed in light of this Court's judgment of July 24, 1994.Premises considered, therefore, and pending determination of the proceeding at bar, the Court Resolved to ISSUE A TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER upon a bond in the sum of Ten Thousand Pesos (P10,000.00) to be posted by petitioner, The Manila Banking Corporation (TMBC):(1) COMMANDING the Presiding Judge of Branch 216 of the Regional Trial Court at Quezon City, Judge Marciano Bacalla, to FORTHWITH CEASE AND DESIST from proceeding with and acting on Civil Case No. Q-97-29856, and to PROCEED to hear and resolve the issue of damages in Civil Case No. Q-93-15920 and such others as arise from the pleadings, absolutely and scrupulously excluding any claim of ownership of Dolores Molina over the property in question which claim has, as aforestated, been finally declared entirely spurious conformably with this Court's Decision of July 24, 1994 and resolution of August 15, 1997; and(2) PROHIBITING Dolores V. Molina, her children, assigns or successors in interest, or their counsel, from ventilating and litigating in any guise, manner, shape, or form said Molina's claim of title over the lands involved in any of the actions and proceedings at bar, or in any other action or proceeding;The Court further Resolved to DENY the motion to dismiss incorporated in respondent Molina's comment dated August 4, 1997, and to ORDER:(1) DOLORES V. MOLINA to SHOW CAUSE, within ten (10) days from notice of this Resolution, why she should not be held in contempt of court for forum shopping and otherwise disregarding and defying the judgment of July 24, 1994 and resolutions of this Court on G.R. Nos. 109645 and 112564 (234 SCRA 455); and JUDGE MARCIANO BACALLA, to EXPLAIN within the same period why he has taken and is taking cognizance of Molina's allegation and claim of ownership despite his attention having been drawn to the aforesaid judgment.SO ORDERED.[238]TMBC posted a cash bond amounting to P10,000.00 on October 2, 1997.[239]Molina filed a With Leave of Court Explanation[240] in compliance with the September 10, 1997 Resolution. She explained that the cause of action in the reconstitution case was different from the cause of action in the quieting of title case:[241]3. The Reconstitution case decided by the Hon. Judge Velasco which was reversed by this Honorable Court merely speaks on the existence of Molina's titles which reconstitution case is a special proceeding and does not touch on-the issue of the validity of the respective claim of ownership of Molina and TMBC.[242]Molina also pleads lack of malice in filing the cases.[243]In addition, TMBC's claim that it derived its ownership from Ortigas is negated by a certification from the Quezon City Register of Deeds. TCT No. 77652 is under the name of Chua Sick Luan while TCT No. 77653 is under the names of Raselle V. Javier, Rodel V. Javier, Regina V. Javier, and Rubespierre V. Javier.[244]Judge Bacalla also filed his explanation.[245] According to him, he was aware of this court's ruling in G.R. Nos. 109645 and 112564. In fact, in Civil Case No. Q-93-15920 entitled Manila Banking Corporation v. Dolores V. Molina, he granted TMBC's Motion to Strike Sham and Dilatory Pleadings in the Order dated August 12, 1997.[246] Also, Civil Case No. Q-97-29856 was no longer pending since he granted Molina's Motion to Withdraw in the Order dated August 11, 1997.[247]Molina subsequently filed a \"Supplemental Motion to Withdraw Complaint to have the same re-raffled to other sala without necessarily dismissing the complaint (with entry of appearance),\" but Judge Bacalla stated that he did not act on the Motion since he considered Civil Case No. Q-97-29856 closed and terminated.[248]This court holds that Judge Bacalla's explanation is satisfactory, while Molina's explanation is unsatisfactory.In the July 25, 1994 Decision in G.R. Nos. 109645 and 112564, this court clearly stated that:WHEREFORE, the petition in G. R. No. 109645 is GRANTED; and that in G. R. No. 112564, DENIED for lack of merit.In G. R. No. 109645, the Decision dated September 23, 1992 of Respondent Judge Tirso Velasco, Presiding Judge of Branch 88 of the Regional Trial Court of Quezon City, in LRC Case No. Q-5404, as well as his Orders dated April 3, 1992, October 14, 1992, and February 10, 1993, are NULLIFIED AND SET ASIDE; the titles of Dolores Molina upheld and reconstituted by said decision and orders \u2014 namely, Transfer Certificates of Title Numbered 124088 and RT-58287 \u2014 and those derived therefrom and subsequently issued \u2014 namely, Transfer Certificates of Title Numbered 83163, 83164, 83165, 83166 and 83167 \u2014 are all Declared NULL AND VOID and are hereby CANCELLED; said LRC Case No. Q-5404 of the Regional Trial Court of Quezon City is DISMISSED; and the temporary restraining order of this Court of May 12, 1993 is MADE PERMANENT.In G. R. No. 112564, the Orders of respondent Presiding Judge of Branch 105 of the Regional Trial Court of Quezon City in Case No. Q-93-15920 dated September 17, 1993 and November 25, 1993 are AFFIRMED; and said Judge is DIRECTED to proceed to dispose of said Case No. Q-93-15920 with all deliberate dispatch conformably with this decision.Dolores Molina and her counsel, Atty. Eufracio T. Layag, and Dr. Jose Teodorico V. Molina, are ORDERED to SHOW CAUSE, within ten (10) days from notice of this judgment, why they should not be pronounced liable, and correspondingly dealt with, for violation of the rule against forum-shopping.SO ORDERED.[249]That Molina actually filed an action for quieting of title, in clear violation of this court's ruling in G.R. Nos. 109645 and 112564, constitutes deliberate forum shopping.Forum shopping is defined as:[w]hen a party repetitively avails of several judicial remedies in different courts, simultaneously or successively, all substantially founded on the same transactions and the same essential facts and circumstances, and all raising substantially the same issues either pending in or already resolved adversely by some other court.[250]Forum shopping consists of the following elements:(a) identity of parties, or at least such parties as represent the same interests in both actions;(b) identity of rights asserted and relief prayed for, the relief being founded on the same facts; and(c) the identity of the two preceding particulars, such that any judgment rendered in the other action will, regardless of which party is successful, amount to res judicata in the action under consideration.[251]All the elements of forum shopping are present in this case. The parties in G.R. No. 112564 and this case are the same: Molina and TMBC.For the second element, the test in determining whether the causes of action are the same:ascertain[s] whether the same evidence will sustain both actions, or whether there is an identity in the facts essential to the maintenance of the two actions. If the same facts or evidence would sustain both, the two actions are considered the same, and a judgment in the first case is a bar to the subsequent action.[252]In this case, Molina asserts that the reconstitution case she previously filed was a special proceeding and did not touch upon the issue of ownership. On the other hand, Civil Case No. Q-97-29856, an action for quieting of title, involved the issue of ownership.[253]Molina's arguments do not hold. These two cases involved relitigating her claim of ownership over the properties covered by the nullified TCT No. 124088.Further, the ruling in G.R. Nos. 109645 and 112564 is res judicata on this case.The elements of res judicata are:(a) the former judgment must be final;(b) it must have been rendered by a court having jurisdiction over the subject matter and the parties;(c) it must be a judgment on the merits; and(d) there must be between the first and the second actions (i) identity of parties, (ii) identity of subject matter, and (iii) identity of cause of action.[254]These requisites are fulfilled. The former judgment, Ortigas & Company Limited Partnership v. Velasco,[255] is final and executory. This court had jurisdiction over the former case, and the judgment was on the merits. Further, although the causes of action may appear to be different, the end result would be the same: to determine the validity of Molina's claim of ownership over the properties covered by the nullified TCT No. 124088.This court also takes notice that Molina was previously found guilty of contempt of court and was fined P1,000.00.[256]This court held that:[w]hat has been stated also suffices to dispose of Molina's theory that her second motion for reconsideration, filed on February 27, 1995, was not covered by the Resolution of March 1, 1995 \u2014 in which this Court reiterated the denial with finality of her motions for reconsideration and, in addition, ordered that \"no further pleadings, motions or papers shall be filed x x x except only as regards the issues directly involved in the 'Motion for Reconsideration' (Re: Dismissal of Respondent Judge)\"; and since Manilabank had manifested that it was no longer filing an opposition thereto, said second motion for reconsideration remains pending and unopposed. To repeat, the second motion for reconsideration, having been filed without express leave, was nothing but a scrap of paper, mere surplusage, incapable of producing any legal effects whatsoever.Apart from the original directive in its Resolution of March 1, 1995, the Court twice reiterated the admonition that no further pleadings, motions or papers should be filed in these cases, except only as regards issues directly involved in the 'Motion for Reconsideration' (Re: Dismissal of Respondent Judge). This it did in its Resolutions dated July 24 and October 25, 1995, respectively.Evidently, an order of this character is directed to parties who obstinately refuse to accept the Court's final verdict and who, despite such verdict and in defiance of established procedural rules, mulishly persist in still arguing the merits of their cause. They continue to take up the time of the Court needlessly, by filing unauthorized, forbidden, even worthless pleadings, motions and papers, serving no real purpose other than to delay termination of the case.Evidently, too, the directive against the filing of any further pleadings, motions or papers is one that exacts observance by all parties concerned, such that wil[l]ful and unjustifiable disregard or disobedience thereof constitutes constructive contempt under Section 3 (b), Rule 71 of the Rules of Court. The record shows just such wilful disobedience or resistance which is not satisfactorily explained in Molina's \"Comment/Answer\" dated October 11, 1995, submitted on requirement by the Court.Molina has had more than her day in court. She was accorded more than ample opportunity to present the merits of her case. Her every argument was heard and considered. The Court cannot countenance defiance of its authority on repetitious assertions of the meritoriousness of a party's cause, no matter how sincerely or genuinely entertained. There has been a final determination of the issues in these cases and petitioner has been repeatedly directed to abide thereby. Her deliberate violation of the orders of the Court are unjustified and inexcusable. The refusal of petitioner Molina to concede defeat, manifested by her unceasing attempts to prolong the final disposition of these cases, obstructs the administration of justice and, therefore, constitutes contempt of Court.WHEREFORE, Dolores V. Molina is found GUILTY of contempt of court for willful disregard and disobedience of the Resolutions of the Court, and a FINE OF ONE THOUSAND PESOS (P1,000.00) is hereby imposed on her, payable within five (5) days from receipt of this Resolution, with the warning that any subsequent disregard and disobedience of this Court's orders will be dealt with more severely.Let this Resolution be published in the authorized Court reports for the information and guidance of the bench and the bar respecting the nature and effect of denials of motions for reconsideration of judgments and final orders, the propriety of second motions for reconsideration, and the prohibition against the filing of further pleadings, motions or other papers.IT IS SO ORDERED.[257] (Emphasis in the original)Regarding TMBC and Reyes' prayer that Atty. Cesar Turiano also be held in contempt, this court notes that he was not included in the Show Cause Order in the Resolution dated September 10, 1997.[258] Further, it appears that he withdrew his appearance as counsel prior to the issuance of the Show Cause Order. Thus, this court shall refrain from making any pronouncements with regard to Atty. Cesar Turiano.WHEREFORE, premises considered, the Petition for Review on Certiorari, docketed as G.R. No. 128422, is DENIED for lack of merit.In G.R. No. 128911, this court resolves to:(1)DECLARE Dolores V. Molina GUILTY of contempt of court due to her willful and deliberate violation of the rule against forum shopping, and for willful and deliberate disobedience of the lawful orders of this court, and impose a fine of P10,000.00, payable within five (5) days from receipt of this Decision;(2) The temporary restraining order dated September 10, 1997 is made PERMANENT; and(3) Treble costs[259] are imposed against Dolores V. Molina.SO ORDERED.Velasco, Jr.,* Del Castillo (Acting Chairperson), Villarama, Jr.,** and Mendoza, JJ., concur.* Designated Acting Member per S.O.

MARCIANO BACALLA, IN HIS CAPACITY AS PRESIDING JUDGE OF THE REGIONAL TRIAL COURT OF QUEZON CITY, BRANCH 216, RESPONDENTS.\n\nDECISION\n\nLEONEN, J.:\n\nThese consolidated cases involve matters that have long been settled by this court. However, petitioner in G.R. Nos. 112564 and 128422, Dolores V. Molina, remained incessant in filing suits that led to the unnecessary clogging not only of this court's but the lower courts' dockets as well.\n\nG.R. Nos. 109645 and 112564 were decided by this court on July 25, 1994. [1] A Motion for Reconsideration was filed by Dolores V. Molina (Molina) on August 10, 1994. She later filed two supplements to the Motion for Reconsideration. [2] Her Motion for Reconsideration was denied with finality in the Resolution dated January 23, 1995. Despite the denial of Molina's Motion for Reconsideration, she filed a \"Motion for Leave to File the Herein Incorporated Second Motion for Reconsideration and to Allow x x x Dolores V. Molina a Day in Court Relative to Her Petition for Reconstitution.\" [3] In the Resolution dated March 1, 1995, this court denied with finality Molina's Motion for Reconsideration. [4]\n\nIn the Resolution dated March 4, 1996, this court found Molina guilty of contempt of court and imposed a fine of P1,000.00. [5]\n\nOn August 15, 1997, this court decided the administrative case against Judge Tirso Velasco (Judge Velasco). [6]\n\nIn order to fully comprehend the facts of G.R. Nos. 128422 and 128911, we summarize this court's decision in G.R. Nos. 109645 and 112564.\n\nI\nG.R. No. 109645 [7]\n\nOn November 14, 1991, Molina filed a Petition for Reconstitution of Transfer Certificate of Title (TCT) No. 124088. [8] She alleged that the original copy of TCT No. 124088 was lost when the Quezon City Register of Deeds was gutted by fire on June 11, 1988 and that she has an \"owner's duplicate copy of the title . . . and that the title is not subject of any document or contract creating a lien or encumbrance on the land therein described.\" [9]\n\nSeveral days later, Molina moved to withdraw her Petition, explaining that she had to go to the United States. Judge Velasco granted her Motion to Withdraw and dismissed the case. [10]\n\nOn April 3, 1992, Molina \"filed an ex-parte motion for review of LRC Case No. Q-5404.\" [11] The Motion was granted on the same date. [12]\n\nThe Office of the Solicitor General objected to the Ex-parte Motion on the ground that the owners of the adjacent properties were not notified. [13] In the Order dated July 3, 1992, Judge Velasco acknowledged that his court had yet to acquire jurisdiction over the owners of the adjacent properties. [14]\n\nOn July 13, 1992, Molina filed an Ex-parte Motion praying for Notices of Hearing to be served on the:\n(a) \"subject owners\" of specified lots in the corresponding \"Technical Description of the subject land;\" (b) the \"President of the Corinthian Neighborhood Association or Corinthian Homeowners Association thru the Barangay Chairman of Barangay Corinthian because the adjoining property designated as Vicente Madrigal is now part of this Barangay Corinthian;\" (c) the \"Director, Bureau of Land, Plaza Cervantes Manila as adjoining owner designated as Public Land;\" and (d) the \"City Engineer of Quezon City for the adjoining boundaries designated as Roads or Road Lot.\" [15]\nHowever, the Clerk of Court gave the Notices of Hearing only to the President of the Corinthian Neighborhood Association, the Director of the Bureau of Lands, and the City Engineer of Quezon City. Thus, the owners of the adjacent lots were not served copies of the Notices of Hearing. [16]\n\nAt this point, Ortigas & Company Limited (Ortigas) found out about Molina's Petition and filed an Opposition. [17] Ortigas subsequently filed a supplemental pleading and alleged the following:\n\n[TABLE_CONTENT]\n(1) | The \"proliferation of syndicates taking advantage of the destruction by fire of land titles kept by the Quezon City Register of Deeds.\"[18]\n | \n(2) | Molina is 'a well-known land speculator' as shown by the petitions she has previously filed. Further, the bases for her claims are contradictory. In Land Registration Case No. Q-336 (WIDORA case), Molina claimed ownership by acquisition through prescription, having been in open and adverse possession of the property for more than thirty (30) years while in Civil Case No. 90-4749, she claimed that she purchased the property from a certain Eusebia Molina.[19]\n | \n(3) | The Land Registration Authority's report which states that:\n | \n | [T]he plan [being] relied upon by Molina, Psd-16740 \"appears to be derived from two different surveys, numbered Psu-1148 & Psu-20191, neither of which appear(s) to have been the subject of original registration; thus it is presumed that no original title had been issued from which TCT-124088 could have emanated;\" that said plan \"is a portion of (LRC) SWO-15352 which is being applied for registration of title in Land Reg. Case No. Q-336, LRC Rec. No. N-50589,\" etc.[20]\n[END_TABLE]\n\n(1) The \"proliferation of syndicates taking advantage of the destruction by fire of land titles kept by the Quezon City Register of Deeds.\" [18] (2) Molina is 'a well-known land speculator' as shown by the petitions she has previously filed. Further, the bases for her claims are contradictory. In Land Registration Case No. Q-336 (WIDORA case), Molina claimed ownership by acquisition through prescription, having been in open and adverse possession of the property for more than thirty (30) years while in Civil Case No. 90-4749, she claimed that she purchased the property from a certain Eusebia Molina. [19] (3) The Land Registration Authority's report which states that: [T]he plan [being] relied upon by Molina, Psd-16740 \"appears to be derived from two different surveys, numbered Psu-1148 & Psu-20191, neither of which appear(s) to have been the subject of original registration; thus it is presumed that no original title had been issued from which TCT-124088 could have emanated;\" that said plan \"is a portion of (LRC) SWO-15352 which is being applied for registration of title in Land Reg. Case No. Q-336, LRC Rec. No. N-50589,\" etc. [20] Ortigas' counsel informed the Manila Mission of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, Inc. (Mormons) of Molina's pending Petition. Thus, the Mormons filed an Opposition. [21]\n\nDuring the hearing, Molina did not mention that she acquired the land through prescription. Instead, she testified as follows:\n[S]he and her late husband had acquired the two (2) parcels of land in question from the latter's relatives in 1939; that she had in truth seen the deed of sale and the titles in her husband's possession; that her husband was killed by the Japanese in 1944; that it was only in the 1960's that she attempted to obtain titles to the property in her name, and sought the help of President Marcos, who \"became her boyfriend;\" that Marcos had, in turn, referred her for legal assistance to former Judge Echeverri; that she had subsequently left for the United States where she stayed until her return during the martial law regime at which time, however, she could no longer get in touch with either Judge Echeverri or President Marcos; that sometime in 1990 she met Gen. Fabian Ver in Singapore, and she was then told that Marcos had given instructions for the delivery to her of the title to the disputed lands, to be accomplished back in Manila; that the title (TCT 124088) was actually delivered to her by Col. Balbino Diego in November, 1990 at her house in Philam Life Homes Subdivision in Quezon City; that she learned that the title had been entrusted to Col. Diego in 1986, when Gen. Ver and President Marcos fled the country, but Diego had been unable to give her the title earlier because he was placed under house arrest shortly after Marcos' deposal and remained under such restraint until May 11, 1988. [22]\nOn September 23, 1992, Judge Velasco granted Molina's Petition and directed the Quezon City Register of Deeds to reconstitute TCT No. 124088 in Molina's name. [23]\n\nOrtigas and the Office of the Solicitor General filed their respective Notices of Appeal, while the Mormons filed a Motion for Reconsideration. [24]\n\nMeanwhile, Molina \"filed a motion to strike the notice of appeal or in the alternative, to allow execution of the decision pending appeal.\" [25]\n\nJudge Velasco dismissed Ortigas' Notice of Appeal, denied the Mormons' Motion for Reconsideration, and granted Molina's Motion for Execution pending appeal. [26] Consequently, Molina was issued TCT No. RT-58287. [27]\n\nThe Solicitor General's Notice of Appeal was dismissed in a separate Order on the ground that:\nthe Solicitor General has not filed any formal opposition to the petition and neither has it introduced and/or formally offered any evidence to warrant its dismissal, it appearing on the contrary, that the Land Management Bureau, the DENR, the Register of Deeds and the City Engineer's Office of Quezon City, which are the government agencies directly involved in this kind of proceeding has not registered any opposition to the petition, the notice of appeal filed by him [28] was sham aside from being ten (10) days late. [29]\nThe Mormons withdrew their Appeal because Molina recognized their ownership and possession of \"an area of 8,860 sq. m. and covered by TCT No. 348048[.]\" [30]\n\nMolina subdivided the property covered by TCT No. RT-58287 into five parcels. One of the parcels of land was purchased by Gateway Enterprises Co., Inc. [31]\n\nOrtigas then filed a Petition for Certiorari and Mandamus with prayer for the issuance of a temporary restraining order. [32] Ortigas prayed that this court:\n(1) Invalidate Judge Velasco's Orders dated October 14, 1992 and February 10, 1993; and\n\n(2) That the TCTs issued, based on Judge Velasco's Order dated October 14, 1992, \"be declared void ab initio and that, alternatively, respondent Judge be ordered to act on the notices of appeal seasonably filed by forwarding the records of LRC Case No. Q-5404 to the Court of Appeals.\" [33]\nII\nG.R. No. 112564 [34]\n\nG.R. No. 112564 originated from an action for \"Annulment of Transfer Certificate of Title with Damages and Prayer for Preliminary Injunction and Restraining Order\" [35] filed by The Manila Banking Corporation (TMBC) against Molina and Gateway Enterprises Company, Inc. This was docketed as Case No. Q93-15920. [36]\n\nTMBC alleged that it owned several parcels of land covered by TCT No. 124088. The subject properties of TMBC's claim were \"formerly covered by TCT Nos. 77652 and 77653\" [37] under Ortigas' name. These properties were converted into a subdivision of several lots. Some of the lots were sold to Manila Interpublic Development Corporation and to Breeders Feeds, Inc. The lots purchased by these two corporations were mortgaged to TMBC as security for their respective loans. The mortgages were foreclosed, and titles were issued in TMBC's name \"as the highest bidder at the foreclosure sales.\" [38]\n\nMolina filed a Motion to Dismiss, citing \"litis pendentia, lack of jurisdiction, bar by prior judgment, plaintiffs [referring to TMBC] lack of status as a real party in interest, and failure of the complaint to state a cause of action.\" [39]\n\nMolina also alleged that a restraining order was issued with regard to TCT No. 124088 and that the trial court where Case No. Q93-15920 was pending \"had no jurisdiction to annul the judgment of a coordinate court.\" [40]\n\nThe trial court denied Molina's Motion to Dismiss. [41]\n\nMolina filed supplemental pleadings to support her Motion to Dismiss, which were denied in the Order dated November 25, 1993. [42]\n\nMolina filed a Petition for Certiorari before this court, praying for the annulment of the Orders denying her Motion to Dismiss. She also prayed that this court dismiss the action for annulment filed by TMBC. [43]\n\nMolina filed the same Petition for Certiorari before the Court of Appeals on December 9, 1993. [44]\n\nIII\nRuling in G.R. Nos. 109645 and 112564\n\nIn the Decision dated July 25, 1994, this court granted Ortigas' Petition for Certiorari in G.R. No. 109645 and denied Molina's Petition in G.R. No. 112564. The dispositive portion of the Decision states:\nWHEREFORE, the petition in G.R. No. 109645 is GRANTED; and that in G.R. No. 112564[,] DENIED for lack of merit.\n\nIn G.R. No. 109645, the Decision dated September 23, 1992 of Respondent Judge Tirso Velasco, Presiding Judge of Branch 88 of the Regional Trial Court of Quezon City, in LRC Case No. Q-5404, as well as his Orders dated April 3, 1992, October 14, 1992, and February 10, 1993, are NULLIFIED AND SET ASIDE; the titles of Dolores Molina upheld and reconstituted by said decision and orders \u2014 namely, Transfer Certificates of Title Numbered 124088 and RT-58287 \u2014 and those derived therefrom and subsequently issued \u2014 namely, Transfer Certificates of Title Numbered 83163, 83164, 83165, 83166 and 83167 \u2014 are all Declared NULL AND VOID and are hereby CANCELLED; said LRC Case No. Q-5404 of the Regional Trial Court of Quezon City is DISMISSED; and the temporary restraining order of this Court of May 12, 1993 is MADE PERMANENT.\n\nIn G.R. No. 112564, the Orders of respondent Presiding Judge of Branch 105 of the Regional Trial Court of Quezon City in Case No. Q-93-15920 dated September 17, 1993 and November 25, 1993 are AFFIRMED; and said Judge is DIRECTED to proceed to dispose of said Case No. Q-93-15920 with all deliberate dispatch conformably with this decision.\n\nDolores Molina and her counsel, Atty. Eufracio T. Layag, and Dr. Jose Teodorico V. Molina, are ORDERED to SHOW CAUSE, within ten (10) days from notice of this judgment, why they should not be pronounced liable, and correspondingly dealt with, for violation of the rule against forum-shopping.\n\nSO ORDERED. [45]\nThis court explained that Judge Velasco had no jurisdiction to decide the reconstitution case since no notice was given to the owners of the adjacent properties. [46] This defect was in violation of Republic Act No. 26, Section 13. [47]\n\nIn addition, Judge Velasco erred in reviving the case after Molina's Motion to Withdraw had been granted. This court discussed that:\n[t]he dismissal of the case, and the lapse of the reglementary period to reconsider or set aside the dismissal, effectively operated to remove the case from the Court's docket. Even assuming the dismissal to be without prejudice, the case could no longer be reinstated or \"revived\" by mere motion in the original docketed action, but only by the payment of the corresponding filing fees prescribed by law. . . . There having been a dismissal or withdrawal of the action, albeit without prejudice, and the order considering the action withdrawn having become final, revival of the case could not be done except through the commencement of a new action, i.e., by the filing of another complaint and the payment of the concomitant docketing fees. [48]\nAs to Molina's claim of ownership, her contradictory statements proved otherwise. In this court's Decision, the following facts were noted:\n\n[TABLE_CONTENT]\n(1) | In the WIDORA case, Molina claimed that she, together with her predecessors-in-interest, were in \"open, public, adverse, continuous and uninterrupted possession\"[49]of the property for more than 30 years. Subsequently, she claimed to have acquired the property through purchase from Eusebia Molina and her heirs.\n | | \n(2) | As to possession of document of title, Molina claimed that when she purchased the property from Eusebia Molina, she had no time to attend to the property's titling since \"she was so preoccupied as the sole breadwinner of the family.\"[50]She later changed her story and claimed that she asked President Marcos to help her.[51]Next, she claimed that she was in possession of the owner's duplicate copy of TCT No. 124088.[52]She again changed her story and claimed that the owner's duplicate copy was not in her possession but she had \"a certification from the Land Management Bureau [and] that there [was] a record of her property in a microfilm negative.\"[53]\n | | \n(3) | The quitclaim and waiver she executed in favor of the Mormons was an \"implied recognition of Ortigas' ownership.\"[54]\n | | \n(4) | Jurisprudence shows that the validity of Ortigas' titles had been decided upon in several cases, namely:\n | | \n | (a) | Cia. Agricola de Ultramar v. Domingo[55]\n | (b) | Ortigas v. Hon. Ruiz[56]\n | (c) | Del Rosario v. Ortigas[57]\n | (d) | Navarro v. Ortigas[58]\n | (e) | Resolution dated August 7, 1992, where this court affirmed the Court of Appeals Decision in CA G.R. SP No. 18085.[59]The Court of Appeals stated that \"Widora and Molina had no more right to apply for the same lands which had already been titled in the name of Ortigas.\"[60]\n[END_TABLE]\n\n(1) In the WIDORA case, Molina claimed that she, together with her predecessors-in-interest, were in \"open, public, adverse, continuous and uninterrupted possession\" [49] of the property for more than 30 years. Subsequently, she claimed to have acquired the property through purchase from Eusebia Molina and her heirs. (2) As to possession of document of title, Molina claimed that when she purchased the property from Eusebia Molina, she had no time to attend to the property's titling since \"she was so preoccupied as the sole breadwinner of the family.\" [50] She later changed her story and claimed that she asked President Marcos to help her. [51] Next, she claimed that she was in possession of the owner's duplicate copy of TCT No. 124088. [52] She again changed her story and claimed that the owner's duplicate copy was not in her possession but she had \"a certification from the Land Management Bureau [and] that there [was] a record of her property in a microfilm negative.\" [53] (3) The quitclaim and waiver she executed in favor of the Mormons was an \"implied recognition of Ortigas' ownership.\" [54] (4) Jurisprudence shows that the validity of Ortigas' titles had been decided upon in several cases, namely: (a) Cia. Agricola de Ultramar v. Domingo [55] (b) Ortigas v. Hon. Ruiz [56] (c) Del Rosario v. Ortigas [57] (d) Navarro v. Ortigas [58] (e) Resolution dated August 7, 1992, where this court affirmed the Court of Appeals Decision in CA G.R. SP No. 18085. [59] The Court of Appeals stated that \"Widora and Molina had no more right to apply for the same lands which had already been titled in the name of Ortigas.\" [60] This court also held that Judge Velasco erred in dismissing the Notices of Appeal filed by Ortigas and the Office of the Solicitor General [61] and in granting Molina's Motion for Execution pending appeal. [62]\n\nThe filing of numerous Petitions by Molina was noted, and this court held that she engaged in forum shopping. Thus, the dispositive portion of the Decision ordered her and her counsel to show cause why they should not be held in contempt. [63]\n\nOrtigas filed a Motion for Reconsideration on the ground that its prayer, \"that Hon. Judge Tirso D.C. Velasco be purged from the judiciary,\" [64] was not granted.\n\nOn the other hand, Molina filed the Motion for Reconsideration dated August 10, 1994, and two supplements to the Motion dated September 22, 1994. [65] The Motion and the supplements were denied in the Resolution dated January 23, 1995. Thus, the Decision dated July 25, 1994 became final and executory for G.R. No. 112564 and G.R. No. 109645. [66]\n\nAlso, the Resolution dated January 23, 1995 included the pronouncement that Dr. Teodorico Molina and counsel Atty. Eufracio Layag were \"guilty of contempt of court for willful violation of the rule against forum shopping.\" [67] A fine of P500.00 wasimposed on each of them. [68]\n\nDespite the denial of her Motion for Reconsideration, Molina still filed a \"Motion for Leave to File the Herein Incorporated Second Motion for Reconsideration and to Allow x x x Dolores V. Molina a Day in Court Relative to her Petition for Reconstitution.\" [69]\n\nThe second Motion for Reconsideration was denied in the Resolution dated March 1, 1995. This court further resolved:\nTO DIRECT that no further pleadings, motions or papers be henceforth filed in these cases except only as regards the issues directly involved in the 'Motion for Reconsideration' (Re: Dismissal of Respondent Judge) of Ortigas & Co. Ltd., dated August 15, 1994.\n\nIT IS SO ORDERED. [70]\nIn the Resolution dated July 24, 1995, [71] this court increased the fine imposed on Dr. Teodorico Molina and counsel Atty. Eufracio Layag to P1,000.00 and resolved:\n\n[TABLE_CONTENT]\n(2) | To DECLARE THESE CASES CLOSED AND TERMINATED, DIRECT ENTRY OF JUDGMENT, AND REITERATE the direction 'that no further pleadings, motion or papers be henceforth filed in these cases except only as regards the issues directly involved in the Motion for Reconsideration (Re: Dismissal of Respondent Judge) of Ortigas & Co. Ltd., dated August 15, 1994' and the proceedings for contempt against Dr. Teodorico Molina and Atty. Eufracio Layag; and\n | \n(3) | To DIRECT the Clerk of Court to transmit the mittimus of both these cases to the corresponding Courts of origin for appropriate action and disposition.[72]\n[END_TABLE]\n\n(2) To DECLARE THESE CASES CLOSED AND TERMINATED, DIRECT ENTRY OF JUDGMENT, AND REITERATE the direction 'that no further pleadings, motion or papers be henceforth filed in these cases except only as regards the issues directly involved in the Motion for Reconsideration (Re: Dismissal of Respondent Judge) of Ortigas & Co. Ltd., dated August 15, 1994' and the proceedings for contempt against Dr. Teodorico Molina and Atty. Eufracio Layag; and (3) To DIRECT the Clerk of Court to transmit the mittimus of both these cases to the corresponding Courts of origin for appropriate action and disposition. [72]\nDespite these Resolutions stating that \"no further pleadings, motions, or others papers\" be filed, Molina still filed the following:\n\n[TABLE_CONTENT]\n(a) | [m]otion to refer the cases to the Court En Banc dated April 5, 1995 (denied by Resolution of June 19, 1995);\n | \n(b) | [consolidated motion dated July 25, 1995, for reconsideration of the June 19, 1995 Resolution (denied by Resolution dated August 28, 1995); and\n | \n(c) | [m]otion dated August 21, 1995 for reconsideration of the July 24, 1995 Resolution (Re: increasing fines on counsels and directing entry of judgment) (denied by Resolution dated October 25, 1995).\"[73]\n[END_TABLE]\n\n(a) [m]otion to refer the cases to the Court En Banc dated April 5, 1995 (denied by Resolution of June 19, 1995); (b) [consolidated motion dated July 25, 1995, for reconsideration of the June 19, 1995 Resolution (denied by Resolution dated August 28, 1995); and (c) [m]otion dated August 21, 1995 for reconsideration of the July 24, 1995 Resolution (Re: increasing fines on counsels and directing entry of judgment) (denied by Resolution dated October 25, 1995).\" [73]\nTMBC filed a Motion for Contempt [74] dated September 18, 1995, praying that Molina be declared in contempt of court and that her Motion for Reconsideration dated August 21, 1995 be denied.\n\nIn the Resolution dated March 4, 1996, [75] this court found Molina guilty of contempt of court:\nIt is clear that petitioner [Dolores V. Molina] was bent on pursuing her claims despite the Court's unequivocal declaration that her claims were lacking in merit, that the proceedings were terminated, and that no further pleadings, motions or papers should be filed. Her persistence constitutes a deliberate disregard, even defiance, of these Court's plain orders, and an abuse of the rules of procedure to delay the termination of these cases.\n\nMolina has had more than her day in court. She was accorded more than ample opportunity to present the merits of her case. Her every argument was heard and considered. . . . There has been a final determination of the issues in these cases and petitioner has been repeatedly directed to abide thereby. Her deliberate violation of the orders of the Court [is] unjustified and inexcusable.\n\nWHEREFORE, Dolores V. Molina is found GUILTY of contempt of court for willful disregard and disobedience of the Resolutions of the Court, and a FINE OF ONE THOUSAND PESOS (P1,000.00) is hereby imposed on her, payable within five (5) days from receipt of this Resolution, with the warning that any subsequent disregard and disobedience of this Court's orders will be dealt with more severely.\n\nLet this Resolution be published in the authorized Court reports for the information and guidance of the bench and the bar respecting the nature and effect of denials of motions for reconsideration of judgments and final orders, the propriety of second motions for reconsideration, and the prohibition against the filing of further pleadings, motions or other papers.\n\nIT IS SO ORDERED. [76] (Emphasis in the original) With regard to the Administrative Complaint against Judge Velasco, TMBC joined Ortigas in praying that he be-removed from the judiciary. [77]\n\nTMBC's Administrative Complaint against Judge Velasco was filed on July 12, 1993 ahead of Ortigas' Complaint and was docketed as Administrative Matter No. RTJ-93-1108. [78]\n\nIn the Resolution dated August 15, 1997, this court held:\nWHEREFORE, Judge Tirso D. C. Velasco is hereby DISMISSED from the service, with forfeiture of all retirement benefits and accrued leave credits, and with prejudice to reemployment in any branch or instrumentality of the government including government-owned or controlled corporations. Immediately upon service on him of notice of this adjudgment, he shall be deemed to have VACATED his office and his authority to act in any manner whatsoever as Judge shall be considered to have automatically CEASED.\n\nSO ORDERED. [79] (Emphasis in the original)\nIV\nFacts of G.R. No. 128422\n\nRespondent Epimaco V. Oreta (Oreta) filed a Complaint against Molina for falsification of public document before the Office of the City Prosecutor in Quezon City. In his Affidavit-Complaint, [80] he stated that he is \"the Head of the Security Force hired to secure certain properties of The Manila Banking Corporation (TMBC)\" [81] and that he is the \"duly-appointed statutory receiver of TMBC.\" [82]\n\nOreta alleged that TMBC owns several parcels of land in Greenmeadows, Quezon City. These parcels of land were purchased at public auctions due to the extrajudicial foreclosure of the mortgages over the lands. [83]\n\nThe registered owners of the properties in dispute purchased the land from Ortigas. [84]\n\nThe one-year redemption period expired, and none of the mortgagors exercised their right to redeem. Thus, \"TMBC executed various Affidavits of Consolidation of Ownership\" [85] and consolidated the titles to the properties.\n\nTMBC paid real estate taxes and transfer taxes relative to the sale and its consolidation of ownership. [86]\n\nIn 1990, Molina filed \"a case for Damages with Prayer for Reconveyance and Preliminary Mandatory Injunction before Branch 88 of the Regional Trial Court of Quezon City[.]\" [87]\n\nMolina claimed that she owns \"[a] parcel of residential land situated at Ugong Norte, District of Cubao, Quezon City . . . containing an area of one hundred twenty six thousand two hundred seventy eight (126,278) square meters, more or less.\" [88]\n\nMolina also claimed that she purchased the property in 1939 from Eusebia Molina, Avelino P. Ramos, and Felix P. Micael. [89]\n\nHowever, Molina was unable to attend to the titling of the property because \"she was so preoccupied as the sole breadwinner of the family with children to support[.]\" [90]\n\nSeveral of the properties owned by TMBC overlapped with the properties being claimed by Molina. [91]\n\nOreta presented documentary evidence to support his allegations:\n\n(1) Report of Atty. Benjamin Bustos, [92] Chief of the Reconstitution Division of the Land Registration Authority, a portion of which states:\nPsd-16740 appears to be derived from two different surveys, numbered Psu-1148 and Psu-20191; neither of which appear to have been the subject of original registration; thus it is presumed that no original title had been issued from which TCT-124088 could have emanated. [93]\n(2) Report of Privadi Dalire, Chief, Geodetic Survey Division of the Land Management Bureau, [94] stating that:\nThe procedures in the assignment of subdivision number is [sic] for each kind of subdivision covering a particular original survey such as the Psu survey. Since these two copies of Psd-16740, one covers Psu-1148 and the other Psu-20191 both for the same survey claimant and located in the same locality, and covered by same microfilm number gives rise to a questionable status of the documents. [95]\n(3) Certification of Mr. Norberto B. Orense, Assistant Chief of the Ordinary Decree Division of the Land Registration Authority, stating that LRC Record No. 781:\nfrom which TCT No. 124088 allegedly emanated, pertains to a land registration case in the province of Palawan from which was issued Decree No. 2827 on 28 February 1908. Furthermore, it was likewise certified that Molina's alleged plans Psu-Nos. 1148 (also appearing on the face of the alleged TCT No. 124088) and 20191 are not subject of any land registration proceedings. [96]\n(4) Certification of Ms. Carmelita Labrador, Administrative Officer V of the Land Registration Authority, stating that the control number on Molina's TCT No. 124088 was issued on February 12, 1975, whereas Molina's TCT was issued on October 30, 1967. [97]\n\nOreta further alleged that because of the issuance of TCT No. RT-58287 [98] and the subsequent issuance of TCT Nos. 83163, 83165, and 83167, [99] an Information for coercion and other forms of trespass was filed against him. [100] However, the basis of the charge against him was a false document. Thus, he prays that Molina \"be prosecuted for the crime of falsification of public document [under Article 171 and 172 of the Revised Penal Code.]\" [101]\n\nMolina filed a Counter-affidavit, stating that she and her husband, Pio Molina, had been in possession of the land covered by TCT No. 124088 since 1939. [102]\n\nIn September 1991, TCT No. 124088 was lost \"and unfortunately, the original thereof on file with the Registry of Deeds for Quezon City was also lost or destroyed due to fire that gutted the said office[.]\" [103] Molina claimed that she went to the Land Registration Authority to inquire where she could find a copy of TCT No. 124088. She found a microfilm negative of TCT No. 124088, which the Land Registration Authority found to be correct. Further, the existence of Psd-16740 was proven by Mr. Armando Bangayan, Assistant Chief, Records Division, Land Management Bureau. [104]\n\nMolina questioned Oreta's authority to file the Affidavit-Complaint. [105]\n\nIn the Resolution dated July 21, 1994, [106] Assistant City Prosecutor Eduardo D. Resurreccion recommended the dismissal of the case. [107]\n\nOreta filed a Motion for Reconsideration, which was denied by Second Assistant City Prosecutor Rogelio U. Concepcion in the Resolution dated November 11, 1994. [108]\n\nOreta filed a Petition for Review [109] before the Department of Justice.\n\nOreta pointed out that TCT No. 124088 was declared null and void by this court. [110] He also pointed out that the alleged microfilm negative of Psd-16740 was never presented by Molina. [111]\n\nWith regard to the certification of the Land Management Bureau that the microfilm negative was not falsified, Oreta pointed out that the certification referred to Psd-16740 and not TCT No. 124088. [112]\n\nMolina filed a Comment, [113] citing Judge Velasco's Decision ordering the reconstitution of TCT No. 124088 [114] and arguing that Oreta's Complaint had no basis. [115]\n\nChief State Prosecutor Zenon L. De Guia reversed the Resolution of the City Prosecutor and directed the filing of \"an information for falsification of public document\" in the Resolution dated April 18, 1996. [116]\n\nMolina filed a Motion for Reconsideration with Manifestation to File Documents. [117] This was denied by then Secretary of Justice Teofisto T. Guingona, Jr. (Secretary Guingona, Jr.) in the Resolution dated November 29, 1996. [118]\n\nUndaunted, Molina filed a Petition for Review on Certiorari [119] before the Court of Appeals.\n\nIn her Petition, Molina raises the following issue:\nWhether the circumstances that [envelop] this case constitute either the offense of falsification of public documents or use of falsified document in a judicial proceeding? [120]\nMolina imputes grave abuse of discretion on the part of the Department of Justice when it directed the filing of an Information for Falsification of Public Document against her. [121]\n\nThe Court of Appeals dismissed Molina's Petition on technical grounds. The Court of Appeals Resolution dated February 4, 1997 states:\nIt appearing that petitioner failed to submit the certified true copies of the assailed Resolutions dated April 18, 1996 and November 29, 1996, the instant petition for review is hereby DISMISSED outright pursuant to Supreme Court Circular No. 3-96 and Section 3(b) and 3(d)(l), Rule 6 of the Revised Internal Rules of this Court.\n\nSO ORDERED. [122]\nMolina filed a Motion for Reconsideration and to Admit Original Certified True Copies of Annexes \"J\" and \"K-l\" to the Petition. [123] She claimed that she complied with Supreme Court Circular No. 3-96 and Section 3(b) of the Revised Internal Rules of the Court of Appeals, but due to inadvertence, the \"original certified true copies of the assailed resolutions . . . [were] not attached to the original copy of the petition but to one of the ten (10) duplicates thereof.\" [124]\n\nThe Motion for Reconsideration was denied in the Resolution dated March 11, 1997. [125]\n\nThe Court of Appeals found that contrary to Molina's assertion that she filed 10 duplicate copies, only four were filed. [126] Of the four duplicate copies, none included the \"duplicate original or certified true copy of the assailed Resolutions.\" [127] Gabionza v. Court of Appeals , [128] cited by her, is not applicable because there was substantial compliance with the rules of procedure in that case. [129]\n\nFrom the denial of her Motion for Reconsideration, Molina filed a Petition for Review on Certiorari [130] before this court.\n\nV\nFacts of G.R. No. 128911\n\nOn January 7, 1997, Molina filed an action for quieting of title and annulment of title before the Regional Trial Court of Quezon City. The subject of the complaint was parcels of land covered by TCT Nos. 83163, 83164, 83165, and 83167. These titles were declared null and void by this court in G.R. No. 109645 and G.R. No. 112564. [131]\n\nThe action for quieting of title was docketed as Civil Case No. Q-97-29856. [132] Molina then moved that the case be consolidated with Civil Case No. Q-93-15920, which was a Petition for Annulment of Title. [133]\n\nTMBC filed a Motion to Dismiss Civil Case No. Q-97-29856, citing res judicata, conclusiveness of judgment, bar by prior judgment, and forum shopping. In addition, the Regional Trial Court cannot annul and set aside the Decision of this court. [134]\n\nMolina opposed the Motion to Dismiss. [135] Subsequently, she filed a 'With Leave Motion to Admit Amended Complaint' dated February 24, 1997. [136]\n\nTMBC and Alberto V. Reyes (Reyes) [137] opposed Molina's Motion. However, the trial court admitted the Amended Complaint and did not act on TMBC's Motion to Dismiss. The trial court's Order dated March 18, 1997 reads as follows:\nBefore this Court are the following:\nSupplement to Complaint dated January 21, 1997\n\nTMBC Motion to Dismiss\n\nBangko Sentral ng Pilipinas Motion to Dismiss\n\nTMBC Motion to Strike Off and/or Dismiss Ad Cautelam Supplement to Complaint dated January 21, 1997 with the respective comments/oppositions thereto.\nConsidering that it is undisputed that TMBC is under receivership, the Motion to Dismiss filed by Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas is hereby granted. This case is dismissed as against Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas, it appearing that Alberto Reyes is the receiver and not the said bank.\n\nAccordingly, the Motion to Admit Amended Complaint with leave is hereby granted, and the amended complaint attached thereto wherein TMBC is dropped as party-defendant and in lieu thereof, Alberto Reyes is impleaded as such is admitted.\n\nLet summons be served on the newly named defendant.\n\nThere is no need to act on TMBC's motion to dismiss given the above circumstances.\n\nSO ORDERED. [138]\nTMBC and Reyes filed a Motion for Reconsideration, which was denied. [139]\n\nTMBC and Reyes filed this Joint Petition for Certiorari and Prohibition with prayer for the issuance of a writ of preliminary injunction/temporary restraining order. [140]\n\nTMBC and Reyes argue that:\n[p]ublic respondent Judge should have dismissed private respondent Molina's Complaint dated 06 January 1997 considering that on its face, it is clear that he has no jurisdiction to take cognizance of the same as it prays for the court a quo to annul and set aside the final and executory decisions of the Honorable Court and the Court of Appeals adjudicating in favor of petitioner TMBC the ownership and possession of the subject properties, subject matter of the private respondent Molina's Complaint and Amended Complaint. [141]\nTMBC and Reyes also cite this court's Decisions in the other cases involving Molina. [142] They point out that Molina's Complaint and Amended Complaint should have been dismissed outright for being a clear case of forum shopping. [143]\n\nVI\nProcedural development\n\nIn G.R. No. 128422, this court granted the Motion for Extension of Time to file Petition for Certiorari and required respondents to comment. [144]\n\nOreta filed a Motion to Consolidate [145] G.R. No. 128422 with G.R. Nos. 109645 and 112564. The Motion to Consolidate was granted in the Resolution dated July 23, 1997. [146]\n\nIn G.R. No. 128911, TMBC and Reyes filed a Motion to Consolidate [147] their Petition with G.R. Nos. 109645 and 112564. [148]\n\nMolina filed an Opposition to the Motion to Consolidate. [149]\n\nIn the Resolution dated May 28, 1997, this court granted the Motion to Consolidate. [150]\n\nMolina filed a Motion for Reconsideration regarding the consolidation of the cases. [151]\n\nIn the Resolution dated June 23, 1997, [152] this court noted the following:\n\n[TABLE_CONTENT]\n(a) | The manifestation filed by TMBC stating that more than two years after the decision in G.R. No. 109645 and G.R. No. 112564 was promulgated, the trial court where Civil Case No. Q-93-15920 is pending had yet to act on TMBC's application for writ of preliminary injunction;\n(b) | Counter-manifestation filed by Molina;\n(c) | Opposition to the motion to consolidate; and\n(d) | Required respondents to comment on the petition for certiorari in G.R. No. 128911.[153]\n[END_TABLE]\n\n(a) The manifestation filed by TMBC stating that more than two years after the decision in G.R. No. 109645 and G.R. No. 112564 was promulgated, the trial court where Civil Case No. Q-93-15920 is pending had yet to act on TMBC's application for writ of preliminary injunction; (b) Counter-manifestation filed by Molina; (c) Opposition to the motion to consolidate; and (d) Required respondents to comment on the petition for certiorari in G.R. No. 128911. [153] TMBC and Reyes filed an Opposition to Molina's Motion for Reconsideration dated 16 June 1997. [154]\n\nOn August 7, 1997, TMBC and Reyes filed a Manifestation and Urgent Motion to Resolve [Application for Issuance of a Temporary Restraining Order and/or Writ of Preliminary Injunction]. [155]\n\nTMBC and Reyes argue that in Ortigas & Company Limited Partnership v. Velasco , [156] this court ordered that Civil Case No. Q-93-15920 be disposed with deliberate dispatch. Civil Case No. Q-97-29856 was consolidated with Civil Case No. Q-93-15920. Thus, Judge Marciano Bacalla's (Judge Bacalla) cognizance of Civil Case No. Q-97-29856 in effect delayed the disposition of Civil Case No. Q-93-15920. [157]\n\nTMBC and Reyes also argue that:\n[p]ublic respondent Judge Bacalla's acts of assuming jurisdiction over Civil Case No. Q-97-29856 and conducting proceedings in said case shall deprive petitioners of their unquestionable right to execute the previous final and executory judgments promulgated by the Court of Appeals and the Honorable Court declaring with finality petitioner TMBC's absolute title and right to possess the Subject Properties. To compel petitioners to defend once again petitioner TMBC's absolute title and right to the Subject Properties would evidently result in a grave injustice. [158]\nIn the Resolution dated August 11, 1997, Molina's Motion for Extension to File Comment was granted, and TMBC's Manifestation dated July 31, 1997 in G.R. No. 128911, \"stating that the pretended issue on the real party in interest in Civil Cases Nos. Q-93-15920 and Q-97-29856[,] has already been rendered moot and academic with the effectivity of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure.\" [159]\n\nIn the Resolution dated September 3, 1997, [160] this court noted the following:\n\n[TABLE_CONTENT]\n(a) | In G.R. No. 128911:\n | (i) | TMBC's Manifestation and Urgent Motion to resolve the application for issuance of a temporary restraining order and/or writ of preliminary injunction dated August 5, 1997; and\n | (ii) | Comment filed by Dolores Molina.\n(b) | In G.R. No. 128422:\n | (i) | Comment filed by Oreta;\n | (ii) | Reply filed by Molina; and\n | (iii) | Granted the Motion for Leave to File Rejoinder to Reply.\n[END_TABLE]\n\n(a) In G.R. No. 128911: (i) TMBC's Manifestation and Urgent Motion to resolve the application for issuance of a temporary restraining order and/or writ of preliminary injunction dated August 5, 1997; and (ii) Comment filed by Dolores Molina. (b) In G.R. No. 128422: (i) Comment filed by Oreta; (ii) Reply filed by Molina; and (iii) Granted the Motion for Leave to File Rejoinder to Reply. Oreta filed the Motion for Further Extension of Time to File Rejoinder [161] dated September 4, 1997. He subsequently filed a Motion to Admit (Rejoinder dated 09 September 1997) [162] and attached a copy of the Rejoinder. [163]\n\nIn the Resolution dated September 10, 1997, [164] this court issued a temporary restraining order in favor of TMBC stating as follows:\nPremises considered, therefore, and pending determination of the proceeding at bar, the Court Resolved to ISSUE A TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER upon a bond in the sum of Ten Thousand Pesos (P10,000.00) to be posted by petitioner, The Manila Banking Corporation (TMBC):\n\n(1) COMMANDING the Presiding Judge of Branch 216 of the Regional Trial Court at Quezon City, Judge Marciano Bacalla, to FORTHWITH CEASE AND DESIST from proceeding with and acting on Civil Case No. Q-97-29856, and to PROCEED to hear and resolve the issue of damages in Civil Case No. Q-93-15920 and such others as arise from the pleadings, absolutely and scrupulously excluding any claim of ownership of Dolores Molina over the property in question which claim has, as aforestated, been finally declared entirely spurious conformably with this Court's Decision of July 24, 1994 and Resolution of August 15, 1997; and\n\n(2) PROHIBITING Dolores V. Molina, her children, assigns or successors in interest, or their counsel, from ventilating and litigating in any guise, manner, shape, or form said Molina's claim of title over the lands involved in any of the actions and proceedings at bar, or in any other action or proceeding[.] [165]\nIn the same Resolution, [166] this court issued a Show Cause Order to Molina and Judge Bacalla, stating as follows:\nThe Court further Resolved to DENY the motion to dismiss incorporated in respondent Molina's comment dated August 4, 1997, and to ORDER:\n\n1) DOLORES V. MOLINA to SHOW CAUSE, within ten (10) days from notice of this Resolution, why she should not be held in contempt of court for forum shopping and otherwise disregarding and defying the judgment of July 24, 1994 and resolutions of this Court in G.R. Nos. 109645 and 112564 (234 SCRA 455); and JUDGE MARCIANO BACALLA, to EXPLAIN within the same period why he has taken and is taking cognizance of Molina's allegation and claim of ownership despite his attention having been drawn to the aforesaid judgment. [167]\nTMBC subsequently filed a Manifestation and Motion [To Partially Withdraw the Joint Petition dated 07 May 1997]. [168]\n\nTMBC informed this court that Judge Bacalla ordered the withdrawal of Civil Case No. Q-97-29856 from his docket [169] and also ordered that Molina's \"patently sham and dilatory pleadings\" [170] be stricken off the records of Civil Case No. Q-93-15920. Thus, TMBC's prayer for injunctive reliefs in the Petition for Certiorari, related to Civil Case No. Q-97-29856, is moot and academic. [171] However, TMBC maintains its other prayers for relief, specifically:\n6.1. The issuance of a temporary restraining order and/or writ of preliminary injunction against private respondent Molina and her alleged representatives, counsel and successors-in-interest from filing pleadings asserting her baseless claims of ownership and possession over the properties subject matter of the Joint Petition dated 07 May 1997;\n\n6.2. The promulgation of a resolution and/or judgment citing private respondent Molina and her counsel, Atty. Cesar Turiano in contempt of court for the contumacious acts of forum shopping, abuse of court processes, deliberate disobedience of formal orders, resolutions and decisions of the Honorable Court and obstruction of the orderly administration [of] justice; and imposing disciplinary sanctions on private respondent Molina's counsel, Atty. Cesar Turiano, for violations of the Lawyer's Oath and the Code of Professional Responsibility and the final and executory decisions rendered by the Honorable Court set forth in the Joint Petition dated 07 May 1997. [172]\nFrom the records, this court issued the Resolution dated October 1, 1997 granting the Motions for Extension of Time to File Rejoinder filed by counsel of Oreta in G.R. No. 128422 and the Motion to Admit Rejoinder. In the same Resolution, this court noted Oreta's Rejoinder, the Manifestation and Motion of TMBC in G.R. No. 128911 partially withdrawing the Joint Petition, and \"the [E]ntry of [A]ppearance [173] of Atty. Napoleon Uy Galit\" as counsel for Molina in G.R. No. 128911. [174]\n\nVII\nIssues\n\nIn G.R. No. 128422, Molina raises the following issues:\n(1) Whether this Honorable Supreme Court is bound by the conclusion of the Honorable Court of Appeals, which, in effect deprive[d] [Dolores V. Molina's] right to appeal[;] [and]\n\n(2) Whether [Dolores V. Molina's] failure to comply strictly with the requirements in appealing a decision is enough to deprive her of her right to appeal. [175]\nIn G.R. No. 128911, TMBC and Reyes filed a Motion partially withdrawing their Petition. Thus, the remaining issues for resolution are as follows:\n\n[TABLE_CONTENT]\n(1) | Whether there are grounds to issue a temporary restraining order/writ of preliminary injunction to put an end to Dolores V. Molina's continuous filing of pleadings involving her \"baseless claims of ownership and possession\"[176]over TMBC's properties; and\n | \n(2) | Whether there are grounds to cite Dolores V. Molina and her counsel, Atty. Cesar Turiano,[177]and Judge Marciano Bacalla in contempt of court.\n[END_TABLE]\n\n(1) Whether there are grounds to issue a temporary restraining order/writ of preliminary injunction to put an end to Dolores V. Molina's continuous filing of pleadings involving her \"baseless claims of ownership and possession\" [176] over TMBC's properties; and (2) Whether there are grounds to cite Dolores V. Molina and her counsel, Atty. Cesar Turiano, [177] and Judge Marciano Bacalla in contempt of court.\nVIII\nArguments of the parties\nG.R. No. 128422\n\nMolina argues that contrary to the Court of Appeals Resolution, copies of the certified true copy of the assailed Letter-Resolution were attached as Annex \"J\" and Annex \"K-l\" to the Petition, [178] except that the original copies were attached to the copies sent to the Department of Justice and Quezon City Prosecutor's Office. [179] This mistake was the fault of Molina's counsel's office secretary and should be considered as an \"honest mistake, inadvertence and oversight.\" [180]\n\nMolina points out that since copies of the assailed Letter-Resolution were attached to the Petitions filed before the Court of Appeals, she should be considered as having substantially complied with SC Administrative Circular No. 3-96 and Section 3(b) and (d) of the Revised Internal Rules of the Court of Appeals. [181]\n\nMolina further argues that the procedural infirmity in the filing of her Petition is not \"enough to deprive [her] of her right to appeal.\" [182] Hence, the dismissal of her Petition is a violation of her right to due process. [183]\n\nOn the other hand, Oreta argues that Molina's Petition is a dilatory tactic. An alias warrant of arrest was issued against Molina after she had failed to appear at her scheduled arraignment. [184]\n\nMolina's Petition may appear to raise procedural issues only. However, if this court grants her Petition, she would be allowed to relitigate her claim based on TCT No. 124088. [185]\n\nOreta cites the principles of \"res judicata, conclusiveness of judgment and bar by prior judgment.\" [186] He also cites Section 47 of Rule 39 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure: [187]\nSection 47. Effect of judgments or final orders. \u2014 The effect of a judgment or final order rendered by a court of the Philippines, having jurisdiction to pronounce the judgment or final order, may be as follows:\n\n(a)\u00a0 In case of a judgment or final order against a specific thing, or in respect to the probate of a will, or the administration of the estate of a deceased person, or in respect to the personal, political, or legal condition or status of a particular person or his relationship to another, the judgment or final order is conclusive upon the title to the thing, the will or administration or the condition, status or relationship of the person, however, the probate of a will or granting of letters of administration shall only be prima facie evidence of the death of the testator or intestate;\n\n(b)\u00a0 In other cases, the judgment or final order is, with respect to the matter directly adjudged or as to any other matter that could have been missed in relation thereto, conclusive between the parties and their successors in interest, by title subsequent to the commencement of the action or special proceeding, litigating for the same thing and under the same title and in the same capacity; and\n\n(c) In any other litigation between the same parties or their successors in interest, that only is deemed to have been adjudged in a former judgment or final order which appears upon its face to have been so adjudged, or which was actually and necessarily included therein or necessary thereto. (49a)\nMolina has not shown any justifiable or compelling reasons why the Court of Appeals Resolution should be set aside. [188]\n\nSince an Information against Molina was filed and docketed as Criminal Case No. 62889 before Branch 31 of the Metropolitan Trial Court of Quezon City, she \"can no longer ask for the review of the finding of a prima facie case by the DOJ against her considering that she has failed to obtain prior leave from said court.\" [189]\n\nOreta points out that the Metropolitan Trial Court acquired jurisdiction over the case when the Information was filed. [190] Molina is considered a \"fugitive from justice\" since she did not appear at her scheduled arraignment. [191]\n\nIn her Reply, [192] Molina argues that although this court declared TCT No. 124088 null and void, \"it does not necessarily mean that it is falsified.\" [193] She also denies that she intends to relitigate her claim of ownership based on TCT No. 124088. [194]\n\nMolina denies forestalling her prosecution by filing this Petition for Review. She then reiterates her argument that she substantially complied with Circular 3-96 and the Revised Internal Rules of the Court of Appeals. [195]\n\nOreta filed a Rejoinder [196] stating that the prosecutor's finding of probable cause to believe that Molina falsified a public document does not mean that she is guilty. Her proper remedy is to present her evidence during trial, and not to file a Petition for Review. [197]\n\nG.R. No. 128911\n\nTMBC and Reyes cite Supreme Court Administrative Circular No. 04-94, the pertinent portion of which states:\n2. Any violation of this Circular shall be a cause for the dismissal of the complaint, petition, application or other initiatory pleading, upon motion and after hearing. However, any clearly willful and deliberate forum shopping by any party and his counsel through the filing of multiple complaints or other initiatory pleadings to obtain favorable action shall be a ground for summary dismissal thereof and shall constitute direct contempt of court. Furthermore, the submission of a false certification or non-compliance with the undertakings therein, as provided in Paragraph 1 hereof, shall constitute indirect contempt of court, without prejudice to disciplinary proceedings against the counsel and the filing of a criminal action against the guilty party[.] [198]\nOwnership over the properties has been decided and passed upon with finality in the following cases: Ortigas & Company Limited Partnership v. Judge Tirso Velasco and Dolores V. Molina , [199] Dolores V. Molina v. Hon. Presiding Judge of RTC, Quezon City, Br. 105 and Manila Banking Corporation , [200] Dolores V. Molina and Aproniano L. Timbol v. Court of Appeals and Epimaco V. Oreta , [201] Epimaco V. Oreta v. Hon. George Macli-ing, in his capacity as Presiding Judge of the Regional Trial Court of Quezon City, Branch 100, and Dolores V. Molina and Aproniano L. Timbol . [202]\n\nDespite these Decisions, Molina still filed a Complaint for quieting of title [203] and an Amended Complaint. [204]\n\nTMBC and Reyes also point out that Molina submitted a false verification and certification in her Complaint and Amended Complaint when she stated under oath the following:\nThat I hereby certify that I have not commenced any other action or proceeding involving the same issues between the same parties in the Supreme Court, the Court of Appeals, or divisions thereof or any other quasi-judicial body and I undertake to inform this Honorable Court of such fact within five (5) days from knowledge thereof. [205]\nMolina never informed this court of the previous Decisions declaring her titles null and void. [206]\n\nIn her Comment, [207] Molina explained that after she had filed an action for quieting of title docketed as Civil Case No. Q-97-29856, TMBC filed a Motion to Dismiss and to Strike Off and/or Dismiss Ad Cautelam Supplement to Complaint on the ground that the issue of ownership had been decided by this court. [208]\n\nShe filed an Amended Complaint when she found out that TMBC was under receivership. The Amended Complaint dropped TMBC as a party and included the Central Bank as the proper party. [209]\n\nThe Central Bank also moved to dismiss the Amended Complaint since TMBC's duly appointed receiver was Reyes. [210]\n\nThe trial court issued the Order dated March 18, 1997, granting the Motion to Admit Amended Complaint, dropping TMBC as a party, and impleading Reyes. [211]\n\nTMBC filed a Motion for Reconsideration but was denied in the Order dated April 23, 1997. [212]\n\nMolina argues that the trial court did not rule upon the merits of her case but only resolved who the real party in interest was. [213]\n\nMolina further argues that the delays in the resolution of Civil Case No. Q-97-29856 were due to TMBC's failure to file its responsive pleading. In addition, TMBC should have filed its Answer instead of a Petition for Certiorari when the trial court denied TMBC's Motion to Dismiss. [214]\n\nThis court now rules as follows:\n\nG.R. No. 128422\n\nThe Court of Appeals erred in dismissing the Petition on procedural grounds. Nevertheless, we affirm the Court of Appeals Resolutions dated February 4, 1997 [215] and March 11, 1997 [216] on the ground that Molina availed herself of the wrong remedy.\n\nSection 3(b) and Section 3(d)(l) of the Revised Internal Rules of the Court of Appeals, which were in force when Molina filed her Petition for Review before the Court of Appeals, provides:\nSection 3. Petitions for Review. - Within the period to appeal, the petitioner shall file a verified petition in seven (7) legible copies and (1) one copy thereof shall be served on each of the respondents. Upon proper motion presented before the expiration of the original reglementary period, the Court may grant a non-extendible additional period of fifteen (15) days save in exceptionally meritorious cases within which to file the petition for review; Provided, however, that should there be no petition filed within the extended period, the case shall be dismissed. A petition filed after the period shall be denied due course outright. The Regional Trial Court shall be furnished a copy of the resolution to this effect.\n\nb. What should be filed. - The petition shall be accompanied by a certified true copy of the disputed decisions, judgments, or orders, of the lower courts, together with true copies of the pleadings and other material portions of the record as would support the allegations of the petition.\n\nd. Judicial action. - The Court may dismiss the petition, or require the private respondent to comment on the petition, or give it due course.\n\n(1) If the petition is not prima facie sufficient in form and substance, the Court may dismiss it outright stating the reasons therefor. If instead of a petition for review, the appellant perfects his appeal pursuant to Rule 41 of the Rules of Court, it shall nevertheless be dismissed even if the Regional Trial Court had given it due course.\nSupreme Court Administrative Circular No. 3-96 [217] dated April 17, 1996 provides:\n1. The \"duplicate original copy\" shall be understood to be that copy of the decision, judgement, resolution or order which is intended for and furnished to a party in the case or proceeding in the court or adjudicative body which rendered and issued the same. The \"certified true copy\" thereof shall be such other copy furnished to a party at his instance or in his behalf, duly authenticated by the authorized officers or representatives or the issuing entity as hereinbefore specified.\n\n3. The certified true copy must further comply with all the regulations therefor of the issuing entity and it is the authenticated original of such certified true copy, and not a mere xerox copy thereof, which shall be utilized as an annex to the petition or other initiatory pleading.\n\n4. Regardless of whether a duplicate original copy or a certified true copy of the adjudicatory document is annexed to the petition or initiatory pleading, the same must be an exact and complete copy of the original, and all the pages thereof must be clearly legible and printed on white bond or equivalent paper of good quality with the same dimensions as the original copy. Either of the aforesaid copies shall be annexed to the original copy of the petition or initiatory pleading filed in court, while plain copies thereof may be attached to the other copies of the pleading.\n\n5. It shall be the duty and responsibility of the party using the documents required by Paragraph (3) of Circular No. 1-88 to verify and ensure compliance with all the requirements therefor as detailed in the preceding paragraphs. Failure to do so shall result in the rejection of such annexes and the dismissal of the case. Subsequent compliance shall not warrant any reconsideration unless the court is fully satisfied that the non-compliance was not in any way attributable to the party, despite due diligence on his part and that there are highly justifiable and compelling reasons for the court to make such other disposition as it may deem just and equitable.\nIn Donato v. Court of Appeals , [218] this court held that:\n[i]n like manner, the failure of the petitioner to comply with Section 3, paragraph b, Rule 6 of the RIRCA, that is, to append to his petition copies of the pleadings and other material portions of the records as would support the petition, does not justify the outright dismissal of the petition. It must be emphasized that the RIRCA gives the appellate.court a certain leeway to require parties to submit additional documents as may be necessary in the interest of substantial justice. Under Section 3, paragraph d of Rule 3 of the RIRCA, the CA may require the parties to complete the annexes as the court deems necessary, and if the petition is given due course, the CA may require the elevation of a complete record of the case as provided for under Section 3(d)(5) of Rule 6 of the RIRCA. At any rate, petitioner attached copies of the pleadings and other material portions of the records below with his motion for reconsideration. [219]\nThe ruling in Donato was subsequently cited in Mendoza v. David [220] and Valdecantos v. People [221] stating that the submission of the required pleadings and attachments in the Motion for Reconsideration was deemed substantial compliance.\n\nIn this case, the Court of Appeals admitted that Molina tried to rectify her mistake. A portion of the Resolution dated March 11, 1997 states:\nIn the case at bar, the petition lacks the required certified true copy or duplicate original of the assailed Resolutions which is clearly an omission violative of the rules. The fact that petitioner in the instant motion has attached the certified true copy of the assailed Resolutions will not cure the defect. Pursuant to Paragraph 5 of Administrative Circular No. 3-96, subsequent compliance shall not warrant any reconsideration. [222] (Emphasis supplied)\nThus, the Court of Appeals erred in dismissing Molina's Petition for Review on procedural grounds.\n\nHowever, we affirm the dismissal of Molina's Petition based on other grounds.\n\nPrior to the filing of the Information, Molina had filed a Motion for Reconsideration of the Resolution dated April 18, 1996, which Resolution directed the City Prosecutor to file an Information against her. [223] The records show that the Information against Molina was filed on May 27, 1996. [224] Her Petition for Review before the Court of Appeals was filed on January 16, 1997. [225]\n\nIn other words, while the trial court had acquired jurisdiction over the case, Molina pursued another remedy, specifically, a review of the City Prosecutor's finding of probable cause.\n\nIn Crespo v. Judge Mogul : [226]\n[t]he rule therefore in this jurisdiction is that once a complaint or information is filed in Court any disposition of the case as its dismissal or the conviction or acquittal of the accused rests in the sound discretion of the Court. Although the fiscal retains the direction and control of the prosecution of criminal cases even while the case is already in Court he cannot impose his opinion on the trial court. The Court is the best and sole judge on what to do with the case before it. The determination of the case is within its exclusive jurisdiction and competence. A motion to dismiss the case filed by the fiscal should be addressed to the Court who has the option to grant or deny the same. It does not matter if this is done before or after the arraignment of the accused or that the motion was filed after a reinvestigation or upon instructions of the Secretary of Justice who reviewed the records of the investigation.\n\nIn order therefor to avoid such a situation whereby the opinion of the Secretary of Justice who reviewed the action of the fiscal may be disregarded by the trial court, the Secretary of Justice should, as far as practicable, refrain from entertaining a petition for review or appeal from the action of the fiscal, when the complaint or information has already been filed in Court. The matter should be left entirely for the determination of the Court. [227]\nThe ruling in Crespo was clarified in Chan v. Formaran III, et al . [228]\nIn subsequent cases, the Court clarified that Crespo does not bar the Justice Secretary from reviewing the findings of the investigating prosecutor in the exercise of his power of control over his subordinates. The Justice Secretary is merely advised, as far as practicable, to refrain from entertaining a petition for review of the prosecutor's finding when the Information is already filed in court. In other words, the power or authority of the Justice Secretary to review the prosecutor's findings subsists even after the Information is filed in court. The court, however, is not bound by the Resolution of the Justice Secretary, but must evaluate it before proceeding with the trial. While the ruling of the Justice Secretary is persuasive, it is not binding on courts. [229]\nChan v. Formaran III , et al. also discussed that the proper remedy to review the Resolutions of the Secretary of Justice was the filing of a Petition for Certiorari under Rule 65. [230] It was further discussed that:\n[a]lbeit the findings of the Justice Secretary are not absolute and are subject to judicial review, this Court generally adheres to the policy of non-interference in the conduct of preliminary investigations, particularly when the said findings are well-supported by the facts as established by the evidence on record. Absent any showing of arbitrariness on the part of the prosecutor or any other officer authorized to conduct preliminary investigation, courts as a rule must defer to said officer's finding and determination of probable cause, since the determination of the existence of probable cause is the function of the prosecutor. Simply stated, findings of the Secretary of Justice are not subject to review, unless made with grave abuse of discretion. [231]\nThus, the Court of Appeals did not err in dismissing Molina's Petition.\n\nIn any case, a review of the records shows that no grave abuse of discretion can be attributed to Secretary Guingona, Jr. when he affirmed the findings of Chief State Prosecutor Zenon L. De Guia (Chief State Prosecutor De Guia).\n\nChief State Prosecutor De Guia, acting on the Petition for Review filed by Oreta, directed the City Prosecutor in Quezon City \"to file an information for falsification of public document against respondent Dolores V. Molina.\" [232] He discussed the following:\nContrary to your finding, the issue in this case is not whether respondent's reconstituted title may be considered as a falsified document but whether or not respondent used a fictitious and non-existent title, TCT No. 124088, in support of her application for reconstitution of title.\n\nWe have gone over the record and we find that the evidence presented by complainant supports a finding that respondent's photocopy of TCT No. 124088 was simulated and given the appearance of authenticity. Several certifications and testimonies from personnel of the Land Registration Authority and the Register of Deeds of Quezon City attest to the fact that the entries in said photocopy of TCT No. 124088 are fictitious and totally inconsistent with the record on file. In fact, in the cases of Ortigas and Company Limited Partnership vs. Judge Tirso Velasco and Dolores Molina, G.R. No. 109645; and Dolores Molina vs. Hon. Presiding Judge of RTC, Quezon City, Branch 108 and Manila Banking Corporation, G.R. No. 112564, jointly resolved and promulgated on July 25, 1994, the Supreme Court declared null and void the reconstituted title of respondent and expressly found respondent guilty of forum shopping by filing cases one after another in order to obtain a judgment in her favor upholding her claim to the subject lands. These facts support a prima facie finding that respondent presented a falsified transfer certificate of title to support her application for reconstitution of title. [233]\nMolina filed a Motion for Reconsideration, which was denied in a Letter-Resolution dated November 29, 1996. Secretary Guingona, Jr. explained:\nAfter an examination of your motion, we find no compelling reason to justify an amendment or reversal of our earlier ruling. Your allegations as to the authenticity and genuineness of TCT No. 124088 have earlier been considered and passed upon by this Office. We reiterate that respondent's documentary evidence can not [sic] be given greater weight than the documentary evidence submitted by complainant which proves that the entries in TCT No. 124088 are spurious. The conflicting evidence submitted by both parties is best left for the court to determine in a full[-]blown trial. Suffice it to say that the evidence warrants a finding that the crime of falsification may have been committed and that respondent is responsible therefor. [234]\nChief State Prosecutor De Guia's Resolution extensively discussed why probable cause existed to file an Information against Molina. He sufficiently explained the reason why he reversed the finding of the City Prosecutor. Clearly, no grave abuse of discretion can be attributed to Secretary Guingona, Jr. when he denied Molina's Motion for Reconsideration.\n\nThis court reminds Molina of the discussion in Punzalan v. Plata : [235]\n\n[T]he Court considers it a sound judicial policy to refrain from interfering in the conduct of preliminary investigations and to leave the DOJ a wide latitude of discretion in the determination of what constitutes sufficient evidence to establish probable cause for the prosecution of the supposed offenders. The rule is based not only upon the respect for the investigatory and prosecutor powers granted by the Constitution to the executive department but upon practicality as well. [236]\n\nG.R. No. 128911\n\nIn the Resolution dated September 10, 1997, [237] this court issued a temporary restraining order and made the following pronouncements:\nIn its Decision dated July 24, 1994 in the consolidated cases of G.R. No. 109645 and G.R. No. 112564 (234 SCRA 455), this Court pertinently ruled that:\n\"Ordinarily, the relief indicated by the material facts would be the remand of the reconstitution case (LRC No. Q-. 5404 [instituted by petitioner Molina]) to the Court of origin with instructions that Ortigas' and the Solicitor General's appeals from the judgment rendered therein, which were wrongly disallowed, be given due course and the records forthwith transmitted to the appellate tribunal. This, in fact, is a relief alternatively prayed for by petitioner Ortigas. Considering however the fatal infirmities afflicting Molina's theory or cause of action, evident from the records before this Court, such a remand and subsequent appeal proceedings would be pointless and unduly circuitous. Upon the fact, it is not possible for Molina's cause to prosper. To defer adjudication thereon would be unwarranted and unjust.\n\n(T)he titles of Dolores Molina upheld and reconstituted by said decision (in LRC Case No. Q-54040 [sic] and others \u2014 namely Transfer Certificates of Title Numbered 124088 and RT-58287 \u2014 and those derived therefrom and subsequently issued namely, Transfer Certificates of Title Numbered 83163, 83164, 83165, 832166 [sic] and 83167 \u2014 are all declared NULL AND VOID and are hereby CANCELLED; said LRC Case No. Q-5404 of the Regional Trial Court of Quezon City is DISMISSED; and the temporary restraining order of this Court of May 12, 1993 is MADE PERMANENT.\n\nIn G.R. No. 112564, the Orders of respondent Presiding Judge of Branch 105 of the Regional Trial Court of Quezon City in Case No. Q-93-15920 dated September 17, 1993 and November 25, 1993 are AFFIRMED; and said Judge is DIRECTED to proceed to dispose of said Case No. Q-93-15920 with all deliberate dispatch conformably with this decision\"\nThe case above referred to, No. Q-93-15920, was instituted in the Regional Trial Court of Quezon City by The Manila Banking Corporation (TMBC) against Dolores V. Molina and Gateway Enterprises Company, Inc., essentially praying for annulment of Molina's title (and others derived therefrom) and for damages. The plain import of this Court's directions in said judgment of July 24, 1994 \u2014 that \"said Judge ** proceed to dispose of said Case No. Q-93-15920 with all deliberate dispatch conformably with this decision\" \u2014 is that the Judge should resolve the issue of damages only; NOT that he should allow re-litigation of, and rehear again and pass upon, Molina's claim of adverse title which conformably with this (Court's) decision, is bereft of any merit whatever. The spuriousness of Molina's claim of ownership having already been adjudged definitively, authoritatively, and finally, that claim should not and could not be legitimate subject of any subsequent action or proceeding in any court, regardless of the guise, manner or form in which it might later be presented.\n\nNow, it appears that Dolores Molina has instituted a new action in the Regional Trial Court of Quezon City, for quieting of title, docketed as Q-97-29856. In this case, she alleged ownership of the land described in Certificates of Title Nos. 83163, 83164, 83165, 832166 [sic] and 83167 which are the very same titles, already declared fictitious and worthless in this Court's judgment of July 24, 1994; and she has succeeded in consolidating said Case No. Q-97-29856 with Case No. Q-93-15920, pending before Branch 216 of the Quezon City RTC, presided over by Judge Marciano Bacalla. It further appears that Judge Bacalla is disposed to take cognizance of and allow ventilation of the action involving Molina's aforesaid fake titles; this, over the opposition of TMBC which insists that Case No. Q-97-29856 be summarily dismissed in light of this Court's judgment of July 24, 1994.\n\nPremises considered, therefore, and pending determination of the proceeding at bar, the Court Resolved to ISSUE A TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER upon a bond in the sum of Ten Thousand Pesos (P10,000.00) to be posted by petitioner, The Manila Banking Corporation (TMBC):\n\n(1) COMMANDING the Presiding Judge of Branch 216 of the Regional Trial Court at Quezon City, Judge Marciano Bacalla, to FORTHWITH CEASE AND DESIST from proceeding with and acting on Civil Case No. Q-97-29856, and to PROCEED to hear and resolve the issue of damages in Civil Case No. Q-93-15920 and such others as arise from the pleadings, absolutely and scrupulously excluding any claim of ownership of Dolores Molina over the property in question which claim has, as aforestated, been finally declared entirely spurious conformably with this Court's Decision of July 24, 1994 and resolution of August 15, 1997; and\n\n(2) PROHIBITING Dolores V. Molina, her children, assigns or successors in interest, or their counsel, from ventilating and litigating in any guise, manner, shape, or form said Molina's claim of title over the lands involved in any of the actions and proceedings at bar, or in any other action or proceeding;\n\nThe Court further Resolved to DENY the motion to dismiss incorporated in respondent Molina's comment dated August 4, 1997, and to ORDER:\n\n(1) DOLORES V. MOLINA to SHOW CAUSE, within ten (10) days from notice of this Resolution, why she should not be held in contempt of court for forum shopping and otherwise disregarding and defying the judgment of July 24, 1994 and resolutions of this Court on G.R. Nos. 109645 and 112564 (234 SCRA 455); and JUDGE MARCIANO BACALLA, to EXPLAIN within the same period why he has taken and is taking cognizance of Molina's allegation and claim of ownership despite his attention having been drawn to the aforesaid judgment.\n\nSO ORDERED. [238]\nTMBC posted a cash bond amounting to P10,000.00 on October 2, 1997. [239]\n\nMolina filed a With Leave of Court Explanation [240] in compliance with the September 10, 1997 Resolution. She explained that the cause of action in the reconstitution case was different from the cause of action in the quieting of title case: [241]\n3. The Reconstitution case decided by the Hon. Judge Velasco which was reversed by this Honorable Court merely speaks on the existence of Molina's titles which reconstitution case is a special proceeding and does not touch on-the issue of the validity of the respective claim of ownership of Molina and TMBC. [242]\nMolina also pleads lack of malice in filing the cases. [243]\n\nIn addition, TMBC's claim that it derived its ownership from Ortigas is negated by a certification from the Quezon City Register of Deeds. TCT No. 77652 is under the name of Chua Sick Luan while TCT No. 77653 is under the names of Raselle V. Javier, Rodel V. Javier, Regina V. Javier, and Rubespierre V. Javier. [244]\n\nJudge Bacalla also filed his explanation. [245] According to him, he was aware of this court's ruling in G.R. Nos. 109645 and 112564. In fact, in Civil Case No. Q-93-15920 entitled Manila Banking Corporation v. Dolores V. Molina , he granted TMBC's Motion to Strike Sham and Dilatory Pleadings in the Order dated August 12, 1997. [246] Also, Civil Case No. Q-97-29856 was no longer pending since he granted Molina's Motion to Withdraw in the Order dated August 11, 1997. [247]\n\nMolina subsequently filed a \"Supplemental Motion to Withdraw Complaint to have the same re-raffled to other sala without necessarily dismissing the complaint (with entry of appearance),\" but Judge Bacalla stated that he did not act on the Motion since he considered Civil Case No. Q-97-29856 closed and terminated. [248]\n\nThis court holds that Judge Bacalla's explanation is satisfactory, while Molina's explanation is unsatisfactory.\n\nIn the July 25, 1994 Decision in G.R. Nos. 109645 and 112564, this court clearly stated that:\nWHEREFORE, the petition in G. R. No. 109645 is GRANTED; and that in G. R. No. 112564, DENIED for lack of merit.\n\nIn G. R. No. 109645, the Decision dated September 23, 1992 of Respondent Judge Tirso Velasco, Presiding Judge of Branch 88 of the Regional Trial Court of Quezon City, in LRC Case No. Q-5404, as well as his Orders dated April 3, 1992, October 14, 1992, and February 10, 1993, are NULLIFIED AND SET ASIDE; the titles of Dolores Molina upheld and reconstituted by said decision and orders \u2014 namely, Transfer Certificates of Title Numbered 124088 and RT-58287 \u2014 and those derived therefrom and subsequently issued \u2014 namely, Transfer Certificates of Title Numbered 83163, 83164, 83165, 83166 and 83167 \u2014 are all Declared NULL AND VOID and are hereby CANCELLED; said LRC Case No. Q-5404 of the Regional Trial Court of Quezon City is DISMISSED; and the temporary restraining order of this Court of May 12, 1993 is MADE PERMANENT.\n\nIn G. R. No. 112564, the Orders of respondent Presiding Judge of Branch 105 of the Regional Trial Court of Quezon City in Case No. Q-93-15920 dated September 17, 1993 and November 25, 1993 are AFFIRMED; and said Judge is DIRECTED to proceed to dispose of said Case No. Q-93-15920 with all deliberate dispatch conformably with this decision.\n\nDolores Molina and her counsel, Atty. Eufracio T. Layag, and Dr. Jose Teodorico V. Molina, are ORDERED to SHOW CAUSE, within ten (10) days from notice of this judgment, why they should not be pronounced liable, and correspondingly dealt with, for violation of the rule against forum-shopping.\n\nSO ORDERED. [249]\nThat Molina actually filed an action for quieting of title, in clear violation of this court's ruling in G.R. Nos. 109645 and 112564, constitutes deliberate forum shopping.\n\nForum shopping is defined as:\n[w]hen a party repetitively avails of several judicial remedies in different courts, simultaneously or successively, all substantially founded on the same transactions and the same essential facts and circumstances, and all raising substantially the same issues either pending in or already resolved adversely by some other court. [250]\nForum shopping consists of the following elements:\n(a) identity of parties, or at least such parties as represent the same interests in both actions;\n\n(b) identity of rights asserted and relief prayed for, the relief being founded on the same facts; and\n\n(c) the identity of the two preceding particulars, such that any judgment rendered in the other action will, regardless of which party is successful, amount to res judicata in the action under consideration. [251]\nAll the elements of forum shopping are present in this case. The parties in G.R. No. 112564 and this case are the same: Molina and TMBC.\n\nFor the second element, the test in determining whether the causes of action are the same:\nascertain[s] whether the same evidence will sustain both actions, or whether there is an identity in the facts essential to the maintenance of the two actions. If the same facts or evidence would sustain both, the two actions are considered the same, and a judgment in the first case is a bar to the subsequent action. [252]\nIn this case, Molina asserts that the reconstitution case she previously filed was a special proceeding and did not touch upon the issue of ownership. On the other hand, Civil Case No. Q-97-29856, an action for quieting of title, involved the issue of ownership. [253]\n\nMolina's arguments do not hold. These two cases involved relitigating her claim of ownership over the properties covered by the nullified TCT No. 124088.\n\nFurther, the ruling in G.R. Nos. 109645 and 112564 is res judicata on this case.\n\nThe elements of res judicata are:\n(a) the former judgment must be final;\n\n(b) it must have been rendered by a court having jurisdiction over the subject matter and the parties;\n\n(c) it must be a judgment on the merits; and\n\n(d) there must be between the first and the second actions\n\n(i) identity of parties,\n\n(ii) identity of subject matter, and\n\n(iii) identity of cause of action. [254]\nThese requisites are fulfilled. The former judgment, Ortigas & Company Limited Partnership v. Velasco , [255] is final and executory. This court had jurisdiction over the former case, and the judgment was on the merits. Further, although the causes of action may appear to be different, the end result would be the same: to determine the validity of Molina's claim of ownership over the properties covered by the nullified TCT No. 124088.\n\nThis court also takes notice that Molina was previously found guilty of contempt of court and was fined P1,000.00. [256]\n\nThis court held that:\n[w]hat has been stated also suffices to dispose of Molina's theory that her second motion for reconsideration, filed on February 27, 1995, was not covered by the Resolution of March 1, 1995 \u2014 in which this Court reiterated the denial with finality of her motions for reconsideration and, in addition, ordered that \" no further pleadings, motions or papers shall be filed x x x except only as regards the issues directly involved in the 'Motion for Reconsideration' (Re: Dismissal of Respondent Judge)\"; and since Manilabank had manifested that it was no longer filing an opposition thereto, said second motion for reconsideration remains pending and unopposed. To repeat, the second motion for reconsideration, having been filed without express leave, was nothing but a scrap of paper, mere surplusage, incapable of producing any legal effects whatsoever.\n\nApart from the original directive in its Resolution of March 1, 1995, the Court twice reiterated the admonition that no further pleadings, motions or papers should be filed in these cases, except only as regards issues directly involved in the 'Motion for Reconsideration' (Re: Dismissal of Respondent Judge). This it did in its Resolutions dated July 24 and October 25, 1995, respectively.\n\nEvidently, an order of this character is directed to parties who obstinately refuse to accept the Court's final verdict and who, despite such verdict and in defiance of established procedural rules, mulishly persist in still arguing the merits of their cause. They continue to take up the time of the Court needlessly, by filing unauthorized, forbidden, even worthless pleadings, motions and papers, serving no real purpose other than to delay termination of the case.\n\nEvidently, too, the directive against the filing of any further pleadings, motions or papers is one that exacts observance by all parties concerned, such that wil[l]ful and unjustifiable disregard or disobedience thereof constitutes constructive contempt under Section 3 (b), Rule 71 of the Rules of Court. The record shows just such wilful disobedience or resistance which is not satisfactorily explained in Molina's \"Comment/Answer\" dated October 11, 1995, submitted on requirement by the Court.\n\nMolina has had more than her day in court. She was accorded more than ample opportunity to present the merits of her case. Her every argument was heard and considered. The Court cannot countenance defiance of its authority on repetitious assertions of the meritoriousness of a party's cause, no matter how sincerely or genuinely entertained. There has been a final determination of the issues in these cases and petitioner has been repeatedly directed to abide thereby. Her deliberate violation of the orders of the Court are unjustified and inexcusable. The refusal of petitioner Molina to concede defeat, manifested by her unceasing attempts to prolong the final disposition of these cases, obstructs the administration of justice and, therefore, constitutes contempt of Court.\n\nWHEREFORE, Dolores V. Molina is found GUILTY of contempt of court for willful disregard and disobedience of the Resolutions of the Court, and a FINE OF ONE THOUSAND PESOS (P1,000.00) is hereby imposed on her, payable within five (5) days from receipt of this Resolution, with the warning that any subsequent disregard and disobedience of this Court's orders will be dealt with more severely.\n\nLet this Resolution be published in the authorized Court reports for the information and guidance of the bench and the bar respecting the nature and effect of denials of motions for reconsideration of judgments and final orders, the propriety of second motions for reconsideration, and the prohibition against the filing of further pleadings, motions or other papers.\n\nIT IS SO ORDERED. [257] (Emphasis in the original)\nRegarding TMBC and Reyes' prayer that Atty. Cesar Turiano also be held in contempt, this court notes that he was not included in the Show Cause Order in the Resolution dated September 10, 1997. [258] Further, it appears that he withdrew his appearance as counsel prior to the issuance of the Show Cause Order. Thus, this court shall refrain from making any pronouncements with regard to Atty. Cesar Turiano.\n\nWHEREFORE, premises considered, the Petition for Review on Certiorari, docketed as G.R. No. 128422, is DENIED for lack of merit.\n\nIn G.R. No. 128911, this court resolves to:\n\n[TABLE_CONTENT]\n(1) | DECLAREDolores V. MolinaGUILTYof contempt of court due to her willful and deliberate violation of the rule against forum shopping, and for willful and deliberate disobedience of the lawful orders of this court, and impose a fine of P10,000.00, payable within five (5) days from receipt of this Decision;\n | \n(2) | The temporary restraining order dated September 10, 1997 is madePERMANENT; and\n | \n(3) | Treble costs[259]are imposed against Dolores V.

CALAYOAN, PROCESS SERVER, REGIONAL TRIAL COURT, BRANCH 2, BANGUED, ABRA, RESPONDENT.\nR E S O L U T I O N\nNICETAS TANIEZA-CALAYOAN, COMPLAINANT, VS. ELMER JERRY C. CALAYOAN, PROCESS SERVER, REGIONAL TRIAL COURT, BRANCH 2, BANGUED, ABRA, RESPONDENT.\n\nR E S O L U T I O N\n\nCARPIO, J.:\n\nThe Case\nBefore the Court is an administrative complaint for Disgraceful and Immoral Conduct filed by Nicetas Tanieza-Calayoan (Nicetas) against her husband, Elmer Jerry C. Calayoan (Elmer Jerry), a Process Server of Branch 2, Regional Trial Court (RTC), Bangued, Abra.\n\nThe Antecedent Facts\nNicetas and Elmer Jerry were married on 18 March 1993 and they subsequently had two children, Michael Jessie T. Calayoan (Michael Jessie) and Jenny Ann T. Calayoan (Jenny Ann). In a sworn Letter-Complaint dated 15 August 2005, [1] Nicetas alleged that Elmer Jerry abandoned her and their children since 18 May 2005 and that he was having an illicit affair with Rina Balboa (Rina). Nicetas further alleged that on 5 August 2005, she and her daughter Jenny Ann saw Elmer Jerry and Rina in Angono, Rizal, where the latter admitted to Nicetas that she was then three months pregnant. [2]\n\nIn his Comment dated 18 January 2006, [3] Elmer Jerry denied that he had any illicit relations with Rina and maintained that Rina was simply a neighbor. Elmer Jerry insisted that the complaint filed by Nicetas was merely a result of her jealousy and suspicion. He further denied the allegation that he was seen with Rina in Angono, Rizal on 5 August 2005 because on this date, a Friday, he was on duty at Branch 2, RTC, Bangued, Abra. To support his claim, Elmer Jerry submitted a certified photocopy of his Daily Time Record (DTR). [4] Elmer Jerry also denied the allegation that he has abandoned his wife and children. On the contrary, Elmer Jerry claimed that he was still living in their family home in Barangay Deet, Tayum, while his wife and children left him to live in Bangued. [5]\n\nOn 10 October 2005, a criminal complaint for Concubinage [6] was filed against Elmer Jerry and Rina in the Municipal Trial Court of Tayum-Pe\u00f1arrubia, Abra. This, however, was subsequently dismissed on a technicality as the criminal complaint was improperly filed. [7] No other criminal complaint for Concubinage was filed against Elmer Jerry and Rina. [8]\n\nIn a letter dated 7 February 2006, [9] Nicetas wrote to the Office of the Court Administrator (OCA), reiterating her allegation that (1) she and her daughter saw Elmer Jerry and Rina in Angono, Rizal on 5 August 2005; (2) when Elmer Jerry and Rina found out that Nicetas had filed an administrative complaint, they transferred to live in the family home of Rina's mother in Bagalay, Tayum, Abra; (3) when Elmer Jerry and Rina became aware of the criminal complaint for Concubinage that was filed against them, they moved back to the house of Rina in Turod, Tayum, Abra, where it was of common knowledge that they were cohabiting as husband and wife; (4) Rina gave birth to a baby girl on 21 January 2006; and (5) Elmer Jerry had had several other illicit relations, one of which was with Rosemarie Jacquias (Rosemarie), a nursing student of Abra Valley Colleges. In support of the allegation that Elmer Jerry had illicit relations with Rosemarie, Nicetas attached the Minutes of Meeting dated 15 June 2000 between the school officials of Abra Valley Colleges, and Rosemarie and her parents. [10] Nicetas also attached Rosemarie's promissory note wherein she promised to stop her \"illicit relationship with Jerry Calayoan.\" [11]\n\nIn his Comment dated 11 September 2006, [12] Elmer Jerry again insisted that his alleged illicit relationships with other women, including that with Rosemarie, were all imaginary and merely the suspicions of his wife Nicetas. As to the picture of Elmer Jerry and Rina, which Nicetas attached to her letter to the OCA, Elmer Jerry explained that it was a simple group picture taken when he was attending a wedding during which Rina was also present as a godmother for a baptism. Finally, as to the daughter of Rina, Elmer Jerry alleged that he had \"no knowledge sufficient to form a belief about this fact\" and that Nicetas was merely speculating that he sired the child.\n\nOn 17 July 2006, in accordance with the recommendation of the OCA dated 22 May 2006, [13] the Court referred the instant administrative matter to the Executive Judge of the RTC at Bucay, Abra for investigation, report and recommendation. [14]\n\nThen Acting Presiding Judge Charito B. Gonzales (Judge Gonzales) initially presided over the investigation of this matter. Thereafter, upon appointment of Judge Elpidio C. Cablayan (Judge Cablayan) to Branch 58, RTC, Bucay, Judge Gonzales turned over this administrative matter to Judge Cablayan. Judge Cablayan, however, retired from the service without completing the investigation. Thus, in a Resolution dated 20 August 2008, the Court referred this case to Acting Presiding Judge Gabino B. Balbin, Jr. (Judge Balbin) for investigation, report and recommendation within sixty (60) days from notice thereof. This period lapsed without any report from Judge Balbin. In an Order dated 27 August 2010, Judge Balbin \"relieved himself of any responsibility in trying and deciding\" the case as Judge Jaime L. Dojillo, Jr. (Judge Dojillo) was appointed as the new presiding judge of Branch 58, RTC, Bucay. Judge Dojillo immediately set the case for presentation of evidence. Thereafter, Judge Dojillo began to hear the testimonies of the parties.\n\nHowever, in a Resolution dated 28 February 2011, the Court directed Judge Balbin to continue with the investigation of the case and to decide the same with dispatch. On 23 March 2011, Judge Balbin filed a Motion to be Relieved as Investigating Judge. Pending resolution of this motion, Judge Balbin heard the testimonies of the parties, continuing from where Judge Dojillo left off. Judge Balbin was able to conclude the investigation and thereafter, he submitted his Findings and Recommendation to the Court. His Motion to be Relieved as Investigating Judge, which had become moot and academic, was subsequently denied.\n\nReport of Investigating Judge\n\nJudge Balbin submitted his Findings and Recommendation dated 10 November 2011, [15] recommending that Elmer Jerry be suspended for one (1) year without pay. While Judge Balbin found the DTR of Elmer Jerry a reasonable defense against the alleged sighting of Elmer Jerry and Rina in Angono, Rizal on 5 August 2005, he gave much credence to the testimony of Michael Jessie in finding that Elmer Jerry and Rina were indeed maintaining an illicit relationship, and thus guilty of disgraceful and immoral conduct:\n\nHowever, the testimony of Michael Jessie Calayoan, the son of the complainant and the respondent, is too revealing to be ignored. He testified that on several occasions, his father, Jerry Calayoan, brought him and his sibling, Jenny Ann, to a house in Bagalay, Tayum, Abra where they ate lunch with Rina Balboa. Jerry Calayoan, Rina Balboa and their daughter, Elagerryn, are the occupants of the bungalow. Jerry Calayoan told them that Rina Balboa is his wife and that, Elagerryn, is their daughter . All of these gave him the impression that they are living together as a family. [16] (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)\nJudge Balbin also took note of the name of the daughter of Rina, Elagerryn, which seemed to be derived from the names of Elmer Jerry and Rina:\n\nFurther, the birth certificate of Rina Balboa's child shows that the father's name was recorded as \"unknown\". There is no need to register name [sic] of the biological father. His name and Rina Balboa's name are all over the child's first name, which is a common practice among Filipino couples. The child's first name is \"ELAGERRYN\". \"ELAGERRYN\" was coined from the respondent's fist name \"ELMER JERRY\", while \"xxxRYN\" was added thereto after \"RINA\", Rina Balboa's first name. That the respondent and Rina Balboa flaunted their illicit relationship by naming their child after them, even after a criminal complaint was filed against them, is the height of insensitivity, for which reason the maximum penalty for the offense should be imposed. [17]\n\nThe Recommendation of the OCA\nThe OCA considered the findings of the Investigating Judge well-taken. In a Memorandum dated 3 March 2014, the OCA also relied heavily on the testimony of Michael Jessie in finding truth in Elmer Jerry and Rina's illicit relationship:\n\nxxx Indeed the testimony of Michael Jessie is compelling enough to hold respondent administratively liable for the offense charged. Michael Jessie personally witnessed respondent and Rina living together as husband and wife when respondent himself brought Michael Jessie on several\u00a0 occasions to the house where he and Rina were cohabiting, along with their child. Michael Jessie may have harbored a grudge towards respondent, but the same may be considered justified. As correctly pointed out by Judge Balbin, such feeling of resentment is a common expression of children like Michael Jessie who have been abandoned by their father to live with another woman. Besides, there is no showing that Michael Jessie was unduly pressured by complainant or anyone to testify against respondent. Hence, his testimony is entitled to full faith and credence. [18]\nThe OCA also took note of Elmer Jerry's alleged past relationship with Rosemarie, which he never denied:\n\nIt bears stressing that this is not the first time that respondent has had an illicit relationship. On cross-examination, complainant testified that before Rina, respondent had an extra-marital relationship with Rosemarie, a nursing student, which respondent never denied. Pieces of evidence were presented during the investigation in support of this allegation like the \"Minutes of Meeting at the Abra Valley College on June 15, 2000\" and \"Promissory Note of Rosemarie,\" which were marked as Exhibits \"H\" and \"I\" for complainant. Both exhibits show that Rosemarie expressly admitted that she had an illicit relationship with respondent. Judge Balbin, however, declared that the promissory note was not admitted in evidence because it was not identified by its author or anybody who has personal knowledge of its execution. Nonetheless, respondent's failure to deny his alleged immoral dalliance with Rosemarie is a tacit admission that such relationship existed and renders inconsequential the exclusion of the promissory note as evidence. [19]\nThe OCA also agreed with the finding of Judge Balbin that the name of Rina's daughter, Elagerryn, reflected the illicit relationship between Elmer Jerry and Rina:\n\nAs correctly pointed out by Judge Balbin, respondent and Rina have flaunted their illicit relationship by naming their child after them by combining the first and last syllables of their respective first names even after a criminal complaint for concubinage was filed against them by complainant. Although the case was dismissed due to a technicality, there is enough reason to warrant respondent's suspension from the service for one (1) year. [20]\nBased on the foregoing, the OCA recommended that: (a) the matter be re-docketed as a regular administrative matter; and (b) Elmer Jerry be adjudged guilty of disgraceful and immoral conduct and be suspended from the service without pay and other benefits for one (1) year.\n\nIn a Resolution dated 13 August 2014, the Court resolved to re-docket the matter as a regular administrative matter against Elmer Jerry.\n\nThe Issue\nThe sole issue in this case is whether Elmer Jerry is guilty of disgraceful and immoral conduct.\n\nThe Ruling of the Court\n\nThe Court finds the report of the OCA in order.\n\nEvery official and employee in the public service is expected to observe a good degree of morality if respect and confidence are to be maintained by the government in the enforcement of the law. [21] Elmer Jerry was expected to adhere to the standard of decency expected of employees in the public service - this is more so because he is an employee of the court. The image of a court of justice is mirrored in the conduct, official or otherwise, of the women and men who work in the judiciary, from the judge to the lowest of its personnel. [22]\n\nElmer Jerry's act of maintaining an illicit relationship with Rina, and previously with Rosemarie, is hardly the behavior expected of court employees. His actions fall under the definition of disgraceful and immoral conduct, provided in the Revised Rules on the Administrative Offense of Disgraceful and Immoral Conduct, to wit:\n\nSection 1. Definition of Disgraceful and Immoral conduct - Disgraceful and Immoral conduct refers to an act which violates the basic norm of decency, morality and decorum abhorred and condemned by the society. It refers to conduct which is willful, flagrant or shameless, and which shows a moral indifference to the opinions of the good and respectable members of the community. [23]\nThis Court, on several occasions, has held that abandonment of one's wife and children, and cohabitation with a woman not his wife, constitutes disgraceful and immoral conduct which should be subject to proper disciplinary action. [24] As established by the evidence on record, Elmer Jerry and Rina were living together as husband and wife, and had a daughter whom they named after themselves. In fact, according to Michael Jessie, Elmer Jerry even introduced Elagerryn and Rina as his daughter and wife, respectively. [25]\n\nElmer Jerry abandoned his wife Nicetas and their two children when he started to live together with Rina and Elagerryn. Not only this, but it seems that he has also been remiss in his duty to provide financially for his children with Nicetas. [26] Elmer Jerry's illicit relations with Rina and his abandonment of his family are defmitely contrary to the acceptable norms of morality, especially since he is expected to maintain a certain degree of decency and morality. His conduct shows moral indifference to the opinion of the good and respectable members of the community. He should be held administratively liable for his disgraceful and immoral conduct.\n\nThe Revised Rules on Administrative Cases in the Civil Service, [27] which govern the conduct of disciplinary and non-disciplinary proceedings in administrative cases, provide that disgraceful and immoral conduct is a grave offense for which the penalty of suspension for six (6) months and one (1) day to one (1) year shall be imposed for the first offense and dismissal for the second.

ANISHA* MAGAYOONG-MACABATO WITH HER SPOUSE DATU KHALIQUZZAMAN MACABATO, PETITIONERS, VS. HEIRS OF CATAMANAN MAMA, REPRESENTED BY HASAN MAMA, RESPONDENTS.D E C I S I O N CARPIO, J.: The CaseG.R. No. 208586 is a petition for review[1] assailing the Decision[2] promulgated on 25 September 2012 as well as the Resolution[3] promulgated on 10 July 2013 by the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. CV No. 01867-MIN. The CA reversed and set aside the Decision dated 25 March 2009[4] of Branch 9 of the Regional Trial Court of Lanao del Sur (RTC) in Civil Case No. 1073-93.In its 25 March 2009 Decision, the RTC rendered judgment in favor of petitioners Heirs of Datu Mamalinding Magayoong (petitioners) and against respondents Heirs of Catamanan Mama (respondents). The RTC quieted petitioners' title over the land described in their complaint and ordered respondents to pay damages to petitioners.In its 25 September 2012 Decision, the CA granted respondents' appeal and set aside the RTC's decision. The CA dismissed petitioners' complaint for lack of cause of action.The FactsThe CA recited the facts as follows:The disputed piece of land at Lilod-Madaya, Marawi City is -A portion of Cadastral Lot No. 38 of the Dansalan Cadastre, at the southeast comer of said lot; bounded on the South, by Mamalampac Ander, measuring 17 meters, more or less; on the North, by City Road to Dilay, measuring 17 meters, more or less; on the East, by lot of Amai M[e]ring, measuring 30 meters, more or less; and on the West, by Road and Lot of Moslem Ayo [part of Lot No. 38] measuring 30 meters, more or less; [or a total area of 510 sq. meters, more or less;] assessed at P800.00; and covered by T.C.T. No. [T-]254; x x x.Sometime in 1963, Datu Muslim Ayo executed a \"Deed of Absolute Sale\" of the disputed property in favor of Datu Mamalinding Magayoong for the price of P800.00. Some three years later, the corresponding Original Certificate of Title [OCT] No. P-189 dated 18 November 1966 was issued in the name of Mamalinding Magayoong.On 4 September 1985, Datu Mamalinding Magayoong died intestate. Before he died, though, he declared that the disputed property must be preserved and reserved for his daughters, petitioners-appellees Maimona and Anisah.On 5 September 1985, Baih Dinganoman Magayoong filed with the Regional Trial Court [RTC], Branch IX of Lanao del Sur a Petition for Perpetuation of Testimony of Datu Mamalinding Magayoong regarding the property.Petitioners-appellees Maimona Magayoong, married to Rasid Pangarungan, and Anisah Magayoong, married to Khaliquzaman Macabato occupied the property, where they both built their homes. Sometime in 1980, Maimona and her husband started a clinic in that lot, the Mamalinding Memorial Specialist Clinic.On 17 September 1993, respondents-appellants, the heirs of Catamanan Mama sent a letter demanding that petitioners vacate the property and to pay accrued rent. Attached to the letter was an Alias Writ of Execution dated 4 September 1979 in Civil Case No. 1953 for Partition of Real Property entitled Maroki Asar Ayo Munder versus Muslim Ayo.On 24 September 1993, petitioners filed Civil Case No. 1073-93 before Branch IX of the Regional Trial Court of Marawi City against the heirs of Catamanan Mama for Quieting of Title over the property.Petitioners aver that they are the actual possessors of the subject property since 1963. In fact, in 1981, they mortgaged it with the Calawi-Bacolod Rural Bank for the sum of P10,000.00 to develop the medical clinic built on the property.In their Answer, respondents stated that the subject property was a portion of Lot 38 covered by OCT No. RO-918[N.A.] in the name of Muslim Ayo. They further stated that Mamalinding Magayoong purchased a residential property from Muslim Ayo which apparently was part of Lot 38 under Transfer Certificate of Title [TCT] No. [T-]254 and registered in the name of Daria [sic] Adiong. Mamalinding Magayoong obtained title to the property under OCT No. RO-918[N.A.].A partition proceeding was instituted by Maroki Asar Ayo Munder before the Court of First Instance of Lanao del Sur, Branch 1 and docketed as Civil Case No. 1953. Lot 38 was partitioned between Muslim Ayo [Lot 38-A], Maroki Ayo [Lot 38-B], and Babai Asar Ayo [Lot 38-C]. The land in question is a portion of Lot 38-C. If at all, respondents aver, petitioners' possession of their portion of the property was by mere tolerance of their predecessors-in-interest.On 25 November 1993, there being no stipulation of facts and no request for admissions, the trial court issued an order declaring the pre-trial terminated.On 28 February 1994, in view of respondents' admission of the material facts in their answer, petitioners moved for judgment on the pleadings. The trial court rendered its 14 November 1994 decision granting petitioners' motion for judgment on the pleadings and upholding petitioners' position. Respondents moved for reconsideration but it was denied in an order dated 20 March 1995. Unperturbed, respondents filed their notice of appeal from the trial court's decision.On 29 December 1999, the Court of Appeals, Manila rendered its decision, to wit:WHEREFORE, the decision appealed from is SET ASIDE and this case is REMANDED to the lower court for reception of the evidence of the parties.SO ORDERED.Hence, trial ensued in the lower court. After the parties submitted their memoranda, the case was submitted for decision.[5]The RTC's RulingThe RTC issued the assailed decision dated 25 March 2009 and ruled in favor of petitioners. The RTC ruled that the evidence proved that petitioners are the owners of the subject land. The RTC stated:As copiously borne by the records, petitioners have preponderantly, if not overwhelmingly, shown that they are the absolute, lawful and true owner [sic] of the parcel of land described in their petition with an area of Five Hundred Ten (510) square meters and covered by OCT No. P-189 (Exhibits \"C,\" \"C-1\" and \"C-2\") issued by the Register of Deeds of Marawi City in the name of the late Mamalinding F. Magayoong in 1966. Said property was acquired by the late Mamalinding Magayoong by purchase from its former owner, Muslim Ayo, as evidenced by a Deed of Absolute Sale of a Portion of a Residential Lot (Exhibits \"A\" and \"A-1\" to \"A-9\") which described with particularity its technical descriptions and boundaries, with its exact location and portion being clearly underscored and delineated in the sketch plan (Exhibit \"A-9\") drawn and/or found at the dorsal side of said deed of sale.[6]The RTC further considered that the following facts and circumstances, taken together, prove that petitioners' predecessor-in-interest had exercised right of ownership over the subject property.\"[I]n 1963, he immediately took possession thereof and occupied it openly, publicly, adversely and uninterruptedly by having it fenced with hollow blocks and had constructed a house thereon which has long been used up to the present to house the Mamalinding Specialists' Clinic established by him for his daughters Dra. Maimona Magayoong-Pangarungan and Dra. Anisah Magayoong-Macabato. He had it declared for taxation purposes as shown by the Tax Declarations marked as Exhibits \"D\", \"D-1\", \"D-2\" and \"D-3\"; and thereafter, he paid the corresponding realty taxes thereon as shown not only by the Official Receipts marked as Exhibits \"E,\" \"E-1,\" \"E-2,\" \"E-3,\" \"E-4,\" \"E-5,\" \"E-6,\" \"E-7,\" \"E-8,\" \"E-9,\" and \"E-10,\" but also by the Tax Clearance marked as Exhibit \"F.\" Moreover, he had it, at one time, mortgaged with the Calawi-Bacolod Rural Bank as a security for a P10,000.00 loan he obtained from said bank sometime in 1981 or 1982. As further indicia of possession and ownership over the property in question, the late Mamalinding Magayoong and Denganuman Magayoong (petitioners' parents and predecessors-in-interest) were even interred on the same parcel of land. Above all, their possession of said property was never disturbed for more than thirty (30) years by anybody, much less the respondents. All these facts and circumstances, taken together, deafeningly and eloquently speak of the stark truth that petitioners' predecessors-in-interest were the true and legitimate owners of the parcel of land in question.[7]The RTC pointed out that the land referred to as covered by TCT No. T-254 in the deed of sale is not the same land referred to as TCT No. T-254 registered in the name of Diaria Adiong.Respondents' protestation, however, cannot be taken hook, line, and sinker so to speak. Transfer Certificate of Title (TCT) No. T-254 (Exhibit \"2\") clearly shows on it [sic] face that it was issued only on October 12, 1967, or almost four (4) years after the aforesaid deed of sale (Exhibits \"A\" and \"3\") was executed on November 19, 1963, and it covers a parcel of land located at the Dansalan Townsite with an area of Three Hundred Eighteen (318) square meters. Clearly and undoubtedly, at the time of the execution of the aforesaid deed of sale dated November 19, 1963 by and between Muslim Ayo and the late Mamalinding Magayoong, TCT No. T-254 was not yet existing as it was not yet issued. Besides, the area of the land as reflected in TCT No. T-254 is only 318 square meters, whereas the area of the land sold under the aforesaid deed of sale dated November 19, 1963 was 510 square meters. Thus, no other logical conclusion can be drawn from the aforesaid discrepancies than the fact that Muslim Ayo and Mamalinding Magayoong did not have in mind TCT No. T-254 at the time they executed the aforesaid deed of sale dated November 19, 1963.[8]The RTC considered respondents' attempt to cast doubt on the propriety of the deed of sale as an indirect attack on OCT No. P-189 issued to petitioners' predecessor-in-interest, Mamalinding Magayoong, by the Register of Deeds of Marawi City on 18 November 1966.The RTC also dismissed respondents' presentation of an Alias Writ of Execution of a decision for the partition of Lot No. 38 in Civil Case No. 1953. The decision was rendered on 2 June 1971, and the Alias Writ of Execution was dated 4 September 1979. Respondents, however, did not register the writ of execution with the Register of Deeds and did not annotate it on OCT No. P-189. Moreover, respondents never filed an action for reconveyance within 10 years from the date of registration of the deed of sale, or the date of the issuance of the certificate of title over the subject property. The deed of sale was executed on 19 November 1963, and registered on 2 June 1964. OCT No. P-189 was issued to Mamalinding Magayoong on 18 November 1966.Finally, the RTC ruled that petitioners proved by preponderance of evidence that they are entitled to moral and exemplary damages, as well as attorney's fees. The dispositive portion of the RTC's decision reads:WHEREFORE, premises considered, judgment is hereby rendered in favor of the petitioners and against the respondents, as follows:1. Quieting petitioners' title over the parcel of land described in their petition dated September 22, 1993 and removing any cloud of doubt that may be cast upon it; and2. Ordering the respondents, particularly Hassan Mama, to pay petitioners the sum of P100,000.00 by way of moral damages, P50,000.00 as attorney's fees and litigation expenses, and P20,000.00 by way of exemplary damages.SO ORDERED.[9]Respondents filed their appellants' brief dated 25 November 2009 through the Public Attorney's Office.The CA's RulingThe CA granted respondents' appeal and reversed the RTC's 25 March 2009 Decision. The CA rejected the RTC's ruling that petitioners' complaint qualified as one for quieting of title.At the outset, it must be stated that had the lower court thoroughly considered the complaint filed, it would have had no other course of action under the law but to dismiss it. Petitioners went no further than to allege in their complaint before the trial court that they received a letter with an attached Writ of Execution from the respondents demanding that they vacate and surrender the property and to pay accrued rentals. The allegation is vague and unconvincing. The trial court could not be reasonably expected to supply the missing details in their complaint. The complaint failed to allege that an \"instrument, record, claim, encumbrance or proceeding\" beclouded the petitioners' title over the property involved.They then proceeded to claim that the writ of execution could not be enforced as they were not made a party to the case and prayed, aside from removing clouds on their title, for damages and litigation costs. Hence, through their allegations, what petitioners imagined as clouds cast on their title to the property were respondents' alleged act of ejecting them from their purported property. Clearly, the acts alleged may be considered grounds for a petition for certiorari but definitely not one for quieting of title.[10]The CA ruled that petitioners do not have the requisite title to avail themselves of the remedy of quieting of title. Petitioners claim ownership of the subject property through the deed of sale between Muslim Ayo and Mamalinding Magayoong and through OCT No. P-189 registered in Mamalinding Magayoong's name. The CA emphasized that the RTC ignored an irregularity in the transaction involving the subject property. The property described in the deed of sale was allegedly covered by a TCT No. T-254, but Mamalinding Magayoong, the petitioners' predecessor-in-interest, registered the property as OCT No. P-189. The CA also found a disparity between the boundaries of the land described in the deed of sale and the boundaries of the land described in OCT No. P-189.First, it must be remembered that petitioners staunchly claimed that their ownership to the disputed property can be traced to Mamalinding Magayoong who bought the property for P800.00 from Muslim Ayo as evidenced by the 19 November 1963 deed of sale. That instrument states that the subject land was a portion of Lot 38 and covered by TCT No. [T-]254. They allege private ownership, as evidenced by the deed of sale. It must also be emphasized that petitioners are asserting that subsequent to the sale, their predecessor was issued a title to the same property and this time covered by OCT No. P-185 [sic]. The records do not show, that it was ever an alienable land of the public domain. Clearly, the Original Transfer Certificate of Title [sic] must then be void because based on the deed of sale, Lot 38 is a private land covered by TCT No. [T-]254 which, therefore, can no longer be the subject of a free patent.Second, the description of the disputed property as found in the deed of sale does not coincide with the technical description of the land covered by OCT No. P-185 [sic], to wit:Deed of Sale:A portion of Cadastral Lot No. 38 of the Dansalan Cadastre, at the southeast corner of said lot; bounded on the South, by Mamalampac Ander, measuring 17 meters, more or less; on the North, by City Road to Dilay, measuring 17 meters, more or less; on the East, by Lot of Amai M[e]ring, measuring 30 meters, more or less; and on the West, by Road and Lot of M[o]slem Ayo [part of Lot No. 38] measuring 30 meters, more or less; [or a total area of 510 sq. meters, more or less;] assessed at P800.00; and covered by TCT No. [T-]254; x x x.OCT No. P-185 [sic]:Beginning at a point marked \"1\" of Lot No. 38-C, on Plan Csd-9914, being S.67-02A., 298.02 m. from B.L.L.M. #1, Dansalan Cadastre, Q-124, thence S.42-21E., 36 m. to point 2; S.57-06 W., 17 m. to point 3; N.42-20W., 29.99 m. to point 4; N.57-09E.; 17.01 m. to point 1, point of beginning.Containing an area of FIVE HUNDRED AND THREE [503] SQUARE METERS.All points referred to are indicated on the plan and are marked on the ground as follows: point 2, by Old B.L. Cyl. Cone. Mon.; and the rest by B.L. Cyl. Cone. Mons.Bounded on the NE., along line 1-2 by the Heirs of Datu Uralin Cunasala [Lot 39, Dansalan Cad., Q-124]; on the SE., along line 2-3 by Heirs of Datu Mamalampak [Lot 51 Dansalan Cad...., along lines 3-4-1 by Asar Inai Musl[e]m [Lot 38-B, Csd-9914].Bearings true.This lot was surveyed in accordance with law and existing regulations promulgated thereunder by Gaudencio M. Camallere, Public Land Surveyor, on June 10, 1965, and approved on September 8, 1966.[11]The CA further stated that petitioners' payment of real property taxes on the subject land for more than 30 years does not prove ownership. The CA reiterated that petitioners are not holders of any legal or equitable title of the subject property, and they failed to meet this requisite for an action to quiet title. The dispositive portion of the CA's decision reads:FOR THE REASONS STATED, the appeal is GRANTED. The decision of the Regional Trial Court of Lanao del [Sur], Branch 09 dated 25 March 2009 is REVERSED and SET ASIDE, and a new judgment will be entered in Civil Case No. 1073-93 dismissing the complaint for lack of cause of action.[12]Petitioners filed a Motion for Reconsideration[13] dated 22 October 2012. The CA denied the motion in a Resolution[14] dated 10 July 2013.The IssuesPetitioners enumerated the following grounds warranting allowance of their petition:With all due respect, it is humbly submitted that the Honorable Court of Appeals has overlooked factors of substance and value which, if considered in their best lights, would affect the decision herein sought to be reconsidered.With all due respect, it is also humbly submitted that the Honorable Court of Appeals has erred in finding that herein petitioners do not have the requisite title to pursue an action for quieting of title.With all due respect, it is likewise humbly submitted that the Honorable Court of Appeals has erred in finding that herein petitioners failed to establish the identity of the land sought to be quieted.With all due respect, it is also humbly submitted that the Honorable Court of Appeals has erred in not finding that herein petitioners are the absolute owners and possessors of the land in dispute.With all due respect, it is likewise humbly submitted that the Honorable Court of Appeals has erred in reversing and setting aside the decision dated March 25, 2009 of the Regional Trial Court of Lanao del Sur, Branch 09 in Civil Case No. 1073-93, and in dismissing said complaint.[15]The Court's RulingWe remand the case to the RTC for the conduct of a relocation survey to identify the metes and bounds of the subject property, which is referred to by petitioners as the lot covered by TCT No. T-254 and previously registered as OCT No. P-189, and by respondents as a portion of Lot No. 38-C, or \"a portion of Lot 38 covered by OCT No. RO-918[N.A.].\"Petitioners have been occupying a particular piece of land since 1963, or for more than half a century. However, the evidence submitted by petitioners does not clearly identify the land being claimed.The CA's finding of fact recites the technical description of the subject land. The deed of sale refers to the subject land as follows:A portion of Cadastral Lot No. 38 of the Dansalan Cadastre, at the southeast corner of said lot; bounded on the South, by Mamalampac Ander, measuring 17 meters, more or less; on the North, by City Road to Dilay, measuring 17 meters, more or less; on the East, by Lot of Amai Mering, measuring 30 meters, more or less; and on the West, by Road and lot of Moslem Ayo (part of Lot No. 38) measuring 30 meters, more or less; or a total area of 510 sq. meters, more or less; assessed at P800.00; and covered by T.C.T. No. [T-]254; the sketch of the portion sold is further made at the back of this instrument and forming part and parcel of this deed[.][16]On the other hand, OCT No. P-189, covered by Free Patent No. 320224 and dated 18 November 1966, refers to the following land:Lot No. 38-C, Csd-9914Beginning at a point marked \"1\" of Lot No. 38-C, on Plan Csd-9914, being S.67-02A., 298.02 m. from B.L.L.M. #1, Dansalan Cadastre, Q-124, thence S.42-21 E., 36 m. to point 2; S.57-06 W., 17 m. to point 3; N.42-20 W., 29.99 m. to point 4; N.57-09 E; 17.01 m. to point 1, point of beginning.Containing an area of FIVE HUNDRED AND THREE (503) SQUARE METERS.All points referred to are indicated on the plan and are marked on the ground as follows: point 2, by Old B.L. Cyl. Cone. Mon.; and the rest by B.L. Cyl. Cone. Mons.Bounded on the NE., along line 1-2 by the Heirs of Datu Uralin Cunasala (Lot 39, Dansalan Cad., Q-124); on the SE., along line 2-3 by Heirs of Datu Mamalampak (Lot 51, Dansalan Cad. x x x), along lines 3-4-1 by Asar Inai Muslem (Lot 38-B, Cad-9914).Bearings true.This lot was surveyed in accordance with law and existing regulations promulgated thereunder by Gaudencio M. Camallere, Public Land Surveyor, on June 10, 1965, and approved on September 8, 1966.Note: Lot 38-C is identical to Lot 5005 Dansalan Cadastre, Q-124, and is covered by FPA-VII-5-1211.[17]Conduct of a Relocation SurveyConsidering that the real property subject of the present action was never identified with certainty, we remand the present case to the RTC for the conduct of a relocation survey by a team of surveyors to determine the identity of the land claimed by petitioners and respondents.Survey is the process by which a parcel of land is measured and its boundaries and contents ascertained; also a map, plat or statement of the result of such survey, with the courses and distances and the quantity of the land. A case of overlapping of boundaries or encroachment depends on a reliable, if not accurate, verification survey. To settle the present dispute, the parties agreed to the conduct of a relocation survey. The Manual for Land Surveys in the Philippines (MLSP) provides for the following rules in conducting relocation surveys:Section 593 \u2014 The relocation of corners or re-establishment of boundary lines shall be made using the bearings, distances and areas approved by the Director of Lands or written in the lease or Torrens title.Section 594 \u2014 The data used in monumenting or relocating corners of approved surveys shall be submitted to the Bureau of Lands for verification and approval. New corner marks set on the ground shall be accurately described in the field notes and indicated on the original plans on file in the Bureau of Lands.[18] (Italicization in the original)The team of surveyors shall be composed of a surveyor designated by the petitioners, a surveyor designated by the respondents, and a surveyor designated by the RTC. The survey shall be conducted in the presence of both parties and/or their authorized representatives. The cost of the survey shall be jointly shouldered by both parties.[19]WHEREFORE, the Decision promulgated on 25 September 2012 and the Resolution promulgated on 10 July 2013 by the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CV No. 01867-MIN are SET ASIDE. The case is REMANDED to the Regional Trial Court of Lanao del Sur, Branch 9, for the conduct of a relocation survey to determine the property subject of this case, and thereafter to decide the case accordingly.SO ORDERED.Brion, Mendoza, and Leonen, JJ., concur.Del Castillo, J., on official leave.* Also referred to in some parts of the records as Dr. Anisah Magayoong-Macabato.[1] Under Rule 45 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure.[2] Rollo, pp. 47-59.

HEIRS OF CATAMANAN MAMA, REPRESENTED BY HASAN MAMA, RESPONDENTS.\n\nD E C I S I O N\n\nCARPIO, J.:\n\nThe Case\n\nG.R. No. 208586 is a petition for review [1] assailing the Decision [2] promulgated on 25 September 2012 as well as the Resolution [3] promulgated on 10 July 2013 by the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. CV No. 01867-MIN. The CA reversed and set aside the Decision dated 25 March 2009 [4] of Branch 9 of the Regional Trial Court of Lanao del Sur (RTC) in Civil Case No. 1073-93.\n\nIn its 25 March 2009 Decision, the RTC rendered judgment in favor of petitioners Heirs of Datu Mamalinding Magayoong (petitioners) and against respondents Heirs of Catamanan Mama (respondents). The RTC quieted petitioners' title over the land described in their complaint and ordered respondents to pay damages to petitioners.\n\nIn its 25 September 2012 Decision, the CA granted respondents' appeal and set aside the RTC's decision. The CA dismissed petitioners' complaint for lack of cause of action.\n\nThe Facts\n\nThe CA recited the facts as follows:\nThe disputed piece of land at Lilod-Madaya, Marawi City is -\n\nA portion of Cadastral Lot No. 38 of the Dansalan Cadastre, at the southeast comer of said lot; bounded on the South, by Mamalampac Ander, measuring 17 meters, more or less; on the North, by City Road to Dilay, measuring 17 meters, more or less; on the East, by lot of Amai M[e]ring, measuring 30 meters, more or less; and on the West, by Road and Lot of Moslem Ayo [part of Lot No. 38] measuring 30 meters, more or less; [or a total area of 510 sq. meters, more or less;] assessed at P800.00; and covered by T.C.T. No. [T-]254; x x x.\nSometime in 1963, Datu Muslim Ayo executed a \"Deed of Absolute Sale\" of the disputed property in favor of Datu Mamalinding Magayoong for the price of P800.00. Some three years later, the corresponding Original Certificate of Title [OCT] No. P-189 dated 18 November 1966 was issued in the name of Mamalinding Magayoong.\n\nOn 4 September 1985, Datu Mamalinding Magayoong died intestate. Before he died, though, he declared that the disputed property must be preserved and reserved for his daughters, petitioners-appellees Maimona and Anisah.\n\nOn 5 September 1985, Baih Dinganoman Magayoong filed with the Regional Trial Court [RTC], Branch IX of Lanao del Sur a Petition for Perpetuation of Testimony of Datu Mamalinding Magayoong regarding the property.\n\nPetitioners-appellees Maimona Magayoong, married to Rasid Pangarungan, and Anisah Magayoong, married to Khaliquzaman Macabato occupied the property, where they both built their homes. Sometime in 1980, Maimona and her husband started a clinic in that lot, the Mamalinding Memorial Specialist Clinic.\n\nOn 17 September 1993, respondents-appellants, the heirs of Catamanan Mama sent a letter demanding that petitioners vacate the property and to pay accrued rent. Attached to the letter was an Alias Writ of Execution dated 4 September 1979 in Civil Case No. 1953 for Partition of Real Property entitled Maroki Asar Ayo Munder versus Muslim Ayo .\n\nOn 24 September 1993, petitioners filed Civil Case No. 1073-93 before Branch IX of the Regional Trial Court of Marawi City against the heirs of Catamanan Mama for Quieting of Title over the property.\n\nPetitioners aver that they are the actual possessors of the subject property since 1963. In fact, in 1981, they mortgaged it with the Calawi-Bacolod Rural Bank for the sum of P10,000.00 to develop the medical clinic built on the property.\n\nIn their Answer, respondents stated that the subject property was a portion of Lot 38 covered by OCT No. RO-918[N.A.] in the name of Muslim Ayo. They further stated that Mamalinding Magayoong purchased a residential property from Muslim Ayo which apparently was part of Lot 38 under Transfer Certificate of Title [TCT] No. [T-]254 and registered in the name of Daria [sic] Adiong. Mamalinding Magayoong obtained title to the property under OCT No. RO-918[N.A.].\n\nA partition proceeding was instituted by Maroki Asar Ayo Munder before the Court of First Instance of Lanao del Sur, Branch 1 and docketed as Civil Case No. 1953. Lot 38 was partitioned between Muslim Ayo [Lot 38-A], Maroki Ayo [Lot 38-B], and Babai Asar Ayo [Lot 38-C]. The land in question is a portion of Lot 38-C. If at all, respondents aver, petitioners' possession of their portion of the property was by mere tolerance of their predecessors-in-interest.\n\nOn 25 November 1993, there being no stipulation of facts and no request for admissions, the trial court issued an order declaring the pre-trial terminated.\n\nOn 28 February 1994, in view of respondents' admission of the material facts in their answer, petitioners moved for judgment on the pleadings. The trial court rendered its 14 November 1994 decision granting petitioners' motion for judgment on the pleadings and upholding petitioners' position. Respondents moved for reconsideration but it was denied in an order dated 20 March 1995. Unperturbed, respondents filed their notice of appeal from the trial court's decision.\n\nOn 29 December 1999, the Court of Appeals, Manila rendered its decision, to wit:\nWHEREFORE, the decision appealed from is SET ASIDE and this case is REMANDED to the lower court for reception of the evidence of the parties.\n\nSO ORDERED.\nHence, trial ensued in the lower court. After the parties submitted their memoranda, the case was submitted for decision. [5]\nThe RTC's Ruling\n\nThe RTC issued the assailed decision dated 25 March 2009 and ruled in favor of petitioners. The RTC ruled that the evidence proved that petitioners are the owners of the subject land. The RTC stated:\nAs copiously borne by the records, petitioners have preponderantly, if not overwhelmingly, shown that they are the absolute, lawful and true owner [sic] of the parcel of land described in their petition with an area of Five Hundred Ten (510) square meters and covered by OCT No. P-189 (Exhibits \"C,\" \"C-1\" and \"C-2\") issued by the Register of Deeds of Marawi City in the name of the late Mamalinding F. Magayoong in 1966. Said property was acquired by the late Mamalinding Magayoong by purchase from its former owner, Muslim Ayo, as evidenced by a Deed of Absolute Sale of a Portion of a Residential Lot (Exhibits \"A\" and \"A-1\" to \"A-9\") which described with particularity its technical descriptions and boundaries, with its exact location and portion being clearly underscored and delineated in the sketch plan (Exhibit \"A-9\") drawn and/or found at the dorsal side of said deed of sale. [6]\nThe RTC further considered that the following facts and circumstances, taken together, prove that petitioners' predecessor-in-interest had exercised right of ownership over the subject property.\n\"[I]n 1963, he immediately took possession thereof and occupied it openly, publicly, adversely and uninterruptedly by having it fenced with hollow blocks and had constructed a house thereon which has long been used up to the present to house the Mamalinding Specialists' Clinic established by him for his daughters Dra. Maimona Magayoong-Pangarungan and Dra. Anisah Magayoong-Macabato. He had it declared for taxation purposes as shown by the Tax Declarations marked as Exhibits \"D\", \"D-1\", \"D-2\" and \"D-3\"; and thereafter, he paid the corresponding realty taxes thereon as shown not only by the Official Receipts marked as Exhibits \"E,\" \"E-1,\" \"E-2,\" \"E-3,\" \"E-4,\" \"E-5,\" \"E-6,\" \"E-7,\" \"E-8,\" \"E-9,\" and \"E-10,\" but also by the Tax Clearance marked as Exhibit \"F.\" Moreover, he had it, at one time, mortgaged with the Calawi-Bacolod Rural Bank as a security for a P10,000.00 loan he obtained from said bank sometime in 1981 or 1982. As further indicia of possession and ownership over the property in question, the late Mamalinding Magayoong and Denganuman Magayoong (petitioners' parents and predecessors-in-interest) were even interred on the same parcel of land. Above all, their possession of said property was never disturbed for more than thirty (30) years by anybody, much less the respondents. All these facts and circumstances, taken together, deafeningly and eloquently speak of the stark truth that petitioners' predecessors-in-interest were the true and legitimate owners of the parcel of land in question. [7]\nThe RTC pointed out that the land referred to as covered by TCT No. T-254 in the deed of sale is not the same land referred to as TCT No. T-254 registered in the name of Diaria Adiong.\nRespondents' protestation, however, cannot be taken hook, line, and sinker so to speak. Transfer Certificate of Title (TCT) No. T-254 (Exhibit \"2\") clearly shows on it [sic] face that it was issued only on October 12, 1967, or almost four (4) years after the aforesaid deed of sale (Exhibits \"A\" and \"3\") was executed on November 19, 1963, and it covers a parcel of land located at the Dansalan Townsite with an area of Three Hundred Eighteen (318) square meters. Clearly and undoubtedly, at the time of the execution of the aforesaid deed of sale dated November 19, 1963 by and between Muslim Ayo and the late Mamalinding Magayoong, TCT No. T-254 was not yet existing as it was not yet issued. Besides, the area of the land as reflected in TCT No. T-254 is only 318 square meters, whereas the area of the land sold under the aforesaid deed of sale dated November 19, 1963 was 510 square meters. Thus, no other logical conclusion can be drawn from the aforesaid discrepancies than the fact that Muslim Ayo and Mamalinding Magayoong did not have in mind TCT No. T-254 at the time they executed the aforesaid deed of sale dated November 19, 1963. [8]\nThe RTC considered respondents' attempt to cast doubt on the propriety of the deed of sale as an indirect attack on OCT No. P-189 issued to petitioners' predecessor-in-interest, Mamalinding Magayoong, by the Register of Deeds of Marawi City on 18 November 1966.\n\nThe RTC also dismissed respondents' presentation of an Alias Writ of Execution of a decision for the partition of Lot No. 38 in Civil Case No. 1953. The decision was rendered on 2 June 1971, and the Alias Writ of Execution was dated 4 September 1979. Respondents, however, did not register the writ of execution with the Register of Deeds and did not annotate it on OCT No. P-189. Moreover, respondents never filed an action for reconveyance within 10 years from the date of registration of the deed of sale, or the date of the issuance of the certificate of title over the subject property. The deed of sale was executed on 19 November 1963, and registered on 2 June 1964. OCT No. P-189 was issued to Mamalinding Magayoong on 18 November 1966.\n\nFinally, the RTC ruled that petitioners proved by preponderance of evidence that they are entitled to moral and exemplary damages, as well as attorney's fees. The dispositive portion of the RTC's decision reads:\nWHEREFORE, premises considered, judgment is hereby rendered in favor of the petitioners and against the respondents, as follows:\n\n1. Quieting petitioners' title over the parcel of land described in their petition dated September 22, 1993 and removing any cloud of doubt that may be cast upon it; and\n\n2. Ordering the respondents, particularly Hassan Mama, to pay petitioners the sum of P100,000.00 by way of moral damages, P50,000.00 as attorney's fees and litigation expenses, and P20,000.00 by way of exemplary damages.\n\nSO ORDERED. [9]\nRespondents filed their appellants' brief dated 25 November 2009 through the Public Attorney's Office.\n\nThe CA's Ruling\n\nThe CA granted respondents' appeal and reversed the RTC's 25 March 2009 Decision. The CA rejected the RTC's ruling that petitioners' complaint qualified as one for quieting of title.\nAt the outset, it must be stated that had the lower court thoroughly considered the complaint filed, it would have had no other course of action under the law but to dismiss it. Petitioners went no further than to allege in their complaint before the trial court that they received a letter with an attached Writ of Execution from the respondents demanding that they vacate and surrender the property and to pay accrued rentals. The allegation is vague and unconvincing. The trial court could not be reasonably expected to supply the missing details in their complaint. The complaint failed to allege that an \"instrument, record, claim, encumbrance or proceeding\" beclouded the petitioners' title over the property involved.\n\nThey then proceeded to claim that the writ of execution could not be enforced as they were not made a party to the case and prayed, aside from removing clouds on their title, for damages and litigation costs. Hence, through their allegations, what petitioners imagined as clouds cast on their title to the property were respondents' alleged act of ejecting them from their purported property. Clearly, the acts alleged may be considered grounds for a petition for certiorari but definitely not one for quieting of title. [10]\nThe CA ruled that petitioners do not have the requisite title to avail themselves of the remedy of quieting of title. Petitioners claim ownership of the subject property through the deed of sale between Muslim Ayo and Mamalinding Magayoong and through OCT No. P-189 registered in Mamalinding Magayoong's name. The CA emphasized that the RTC ignored an irregularity in the transaction involving the subject property. The property described in the deed of sale was allegedly covered by a TCT No. T-254, but Mamalinding Magayoong, the petitioners' predecessor-in-interest, registered the property as OCT No. P-189. The CA also found a disparity between the boundaries of the land described in the deed of sale and the boundaries of the land described in OCT No. P-189.\nFirst, it must be remembered that petitioners staunchly claimed that their ownership to the disputed property can be traced to Mamalinding Magayoong who bought the property for P800.00 from Muslim Ayo as evidenced by the 19 November 1963 deed of sale. That instrument states that the subject land was a portion of Lot 38 and covered by TCT No. [T-]254. They allege private ownership, as evidenced by the deed of sale. It must also be emphasized that petitioners are asserting that subsequent to the sale, their predecessor was issued a title to the same property and this time covered by OCT No. P-185 [sic]. The records do not show, that it was ever an alienable land of the public domain. Clearly, the Original Transfer Certificate of Title [sic] must then be void because based on the deed of sale, Lot 38 is a private land covered by TCT No. [T-]254 which, therefore, can no longer be the subject of a free patent.\n\nSecond, the description of the disputed property as found in the deed of sale does not coincide with the technical description of the land covered by OCT No. P-185 [sic], to wit:\nDeed of Sale:\n\nA portion of Cadastral Lot No. 38 of the Dansalan Cadastre, at the southeast corner of said lot; bounded on the South, by Mamalampac Ander, measuring 17 meters, more or less; on the North, by City Road to Dilay, measuring 17 meters, more or less; on the East, by Lot of Amai M[e]ring, measuring 30 meters, more or less; and on the West, by Road and Lot of M[o]slem Ayo [part of Lot No. 38] measuring 30 meters, more or less; [or a total area of 510 sq. meters, more or less;] assessed at P800.00; and covered by TCT No. [T-]254; x x x.\n\nOCT No. P-185 [sic]:\n\nBeginning at a point marked \"1\" of Lot No. 38-C, on Plan Csd-9914, being S.67-02A., 298.02 m. from B.L.L.M. #1, Dansalan Cadastre, Q-124, thence S.42-21E., 36 m. to point 2; S.57-06 W., 17 m. to point 3; N.42-20W., 29.99 m. to point 4; N.57-09E.; 17.01 m. to point 1, point of beginning.\n\nContaining an area of FIVE HUNDRED AND THREE [503] SQUARE METERS.\n\nAll points referred to are indicated on the plan and are marked on the ground as follows: point 2, by Old B.L. Cyl. Cone. Mon.; and the rest by B.L. Cyl. Cone. Mons.\n\nBounded on the NE., along line 1-2 by the Heirs of Datu Uralin Cunasala [Lot 39, Dansalan Cad., Q-124]; on the SE., along line 2-3 by Heirs of Datu Mamalampak [Lot 51 Dansalan Cad...., along lines 3-4-1 by Asar Inai Musl[e]m [Lot 38-B, Csd-9914].\n\nBearings true.\n\nThis lot was surveyed in accordance with law and existing regulations promulgated thereunder by Gaudencio M. Camallere, Public Land Surveyor, on June 10, 1965, and approved on September 8, 1966. [11]\nThe CA further stated that petitioners' payment of real property taxes on the subject land for more than 30 years does not prove ownership. The CA reiterated that petitioners are not holders of any legal or equitable title of the subject property, and they failed to meet this requisite for an action to quiet title. The dispositive portion of the CA's decision reads:\nFOR THE REASONS STATED, the appeal is GRANTED. The decision of the Regional Trial Court of Lanao del [Sur], Branch 09 dated 25 March 2009 is REVERSED and SET ASIDE, and a new judgment will be entered in Civil Case No. 1073-93 dismissing the complaint for lack of cause of action. [12]\nPetitioners filed a Motion for Reconsideration [13] dated 22 October 2012. The CA denied the motion in a Resolution [14] dated 10 July 2013.\n\nThe Issues\n\nPetitioners enumerated the following grounds warranting allowance of their petition:\nWith all due respect, it is humbly submitted that the Honorable Court of Appeals has overlooked factors of substance and value which, if considered in their best lights, would affect the decision herein sought to be reconsidered.\n\nWith all due respect, it is also humbly submitted that the Honorable Court of Appeals has erred in finding that herein petitioners do not have the requisite title to pursue an action for quieting of title.\n\nWith all due respect, it is likewise humbly submitted that the Honorable Court of Appeals has erred in finding that herein petitioners failed to establish the identity of the land sought to be quieted.\n\nWith all due respect, it is also humbly submitted that the Honorable Court of Appeals has erred in not finding that herein petitioners are the absolute owners and possessors of the land in dispute.\n\nWith all due respect, it is likewise humbly submitted that the Honorable Court of Appeals has erred in reversing and setting aside the decision dated March 25, 2009 of the Regional Trial Court of Lanao del Sur, Branch 09 in Civil Case No. 1073-93, and in dismissing said complaint. [15]\nThe Court's Ruling\n\nWe remand the case to the RTC for the conduct of a relocation survey to identify the metes and bounds of the subject property, which is referred to by petitioners as the lot covered by TCT No. T-254 and previously registered as OCT No. P-189, and by respondents as a portion of Lot No. 38-C, or \"a portion of Lot 38 covered by OCT No. RO-918[N.A.].\"\n\nPetitioners have been occupying a particular piece of land since 1963, or for more than half a century. However, the evidence submitted by petitioners does not clearly identify the land being claimed.\n\nThe CA's finding of fact recites the technical description of the subject land. The deed of sale refers to the subject land as follows:\nA portion of Cadastral Lot No. 38 of the Dansalan Cadastre, at the southeast corner of said lot; bounded on the South, by Mamalampac Ander, measuring 17 meters, more or less; on the North, by City Road to Dilay, measuring 17 meters, more or less; on the East, by Lot of Amai Mering, measuring 30 meters, more or less; and on the West, by Road and lot of Moslem Ayo (part of Lot No. 38) measuring 30 meters, more or less; or a total area of 510 sq. meters, more or less; assessed at P800.00; and covered by T.C.T. No. [T-]254; the sketch of the portion sold is further made at the back of this instrument and forming part and parcel of this deed[.] [16]\nOn the other hand, OCT No. P-189, covered by Free Patent No. 320224 and dated 18 November 1966, refers to the following land:\nLot No. 38-C, Csd-9914\n\nBeginning at a point marked \"1\" of Lot No. 38-C, on Plan Csd-9914, being S.67-02A., 298.02 m. from B.L.L.M. #1, Dansalan Cadastre, Q-124, thence S.42-21 E., 36 m. to point 2; S.57-06 W., 17 m. to point 3; N.42-20 W., 29.99 m. to point 4; N.57-09 E; 17.01 m. to point 1, point of beginning.\n\nContaining an area of FIVE HUNDRED AND THREE (503) SQUARE METERS.\n\nAll points referred to are indicated on the plan and are marked on the ground as follows: point 2, by Old B.L. Cyl. Cone. Mon.; and the rest by B.L. Cyl. Cone. Mons.\n\nBounded on the NE., along line 1-2 by the Heirs of Datu Uralin Cunasala (Lot 39, Dansalan Cad., Q-124); on the SE., along line 2-3 by Heirs of Datu Mamalampak (Lot 51, Dansalan Cad. x x x), along lines 3-4-1 by Asar Inai Muslem (Lot 38-B, Cad-9914).\n\nBearings true.\n\nThis lot was surveyed in accordance with law and existing regulations promulgated thereunder by Gaudencio M. Camallere, Public Land Surveyor, on June 10, 1965, and approved on September 8, 1966.\n\nNote: Lot 38-C is identical to Lot 5005 Dansalan Cadastre, Q-124, and is covered by FPA-VII-5-1211. [17]\nConduct of a Relocation Survey\n\nConsidering that the real property subject of the present action was never identified with certainty, we remand the present case to the RTC for the conduct of a relocation survey by a team of surveyors to determine the identity of the land claimed by petitioners and respondents.\nSurvey is the process by which a parcel of land is measured and its boundaries and contents ascertained; also a map, plat or statement of the result of such survey, with the courses and distances and the quantity of the land. A case of overlapping of boundaries or encroachment depends on a reliable, if not accurate, verification survey. To settle the present dispute, the parties agreed to the conduct of a relocation survey. The Manual for Land Surveys in the Philippines (MLSP) provides for the following rules in conducting relocation surveys:\n\nSection 593 \u2014 The relocation of corners or re-establishment of boundary lines shall be made using the bearings, distances and areas approved by the Director of Lands or written in the lease or Torrens title .\n\nSection 594 \u2014 The data used in monumenting or relocating corners of approved surveys shall be submitted to the Bureau of Lands for verification and approval . New corner marks set on the ground shall be accurately described in the field notes and indicated on the original plans on file in the Bureau of Lands. [18] (Italicization in the original)\nThe team of surveyors shall be composed of a surveyor designated by the petitioners, a surveyor designated by the respondents, and a surveyor designated by the RTC. The survey shall be conducted in the presence of both parties and/or their authorized representatives. The cost of the survey shall be jointly shouldered by both parties. [19]\n\nWHEREFORE , the Decision promulgated on 25 September 2012 and the Resolution promulgated on 10 July 2013 by the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CV No. 01867-MIN are SET ASIDE . The case is REMANDED to the Regional Trial Court of Lanao del Sur, Branch 9, for the conduct of a relocation survey to determine the property subject of this case, and thereafter to decide the case accordingly.\n\nSO ORDERED.\n\nBrion, Mendoza , and Leonen, JJ. , concur.\nDel Castillo, J. , on official leave.\n\n* Also referred to in some parts of the records as Dr. Anisah Magayoong-Macabato.\n\n[1] Under Rule 45 of the 1997 Rules of Civil Procedure.\n\n[2] Rollo , pp. 47-59.

RAMOS, RESPONDENT.\n\nD E C I S I O N\n\nPER CURIAM:\n\nBefore the Court is the Complaint-Affidavit, [1] filed by Nenita De Guzman Ferguson (complainant), seeking the disbarment of Atty. Salvador P. Ramos (Atty. Ramos) for falsification, violation of notarial law and engaging in private practice while employed in the government service.\n\nThe Antecedents\n\nComplainant alleged that on November 25, 2007, she purchased a house and lot located in San Rafael, Bulacan, for the sum of P800,000.00; that without her knowledge, the seller obtained a Certificate of Land Ownership Award (CLOA) mainly to transfer the title of the said property to her name; that the seller was unaware that the said CLOA was void ab initio as the subject land was not an agricultural land and there existed a 10-year prohibition to transfer the subject land; that in 2009; complainant instituted a petition for the cancellation of the CLOA before the DAR Office; that the\u00a0 defendants were represented by Atty. Ramos, who was the Chief Legal Officer of DAR-Provincial Office in Bulacan; that complainant withdrew the petition before the DAR and filed the case before the Regional Trial Court, Branch 12, Malolos City (RTC); that upon receipt of the Answer, complainant found out that it was strikingly similar to the one filed by the defendants in the DAR, which was prepared by Atty. Ramos; that complainant discovered that the Deed of Sale [2] dated April 24, 2009, which became the basis of the transfer of title was fraudulently altered as it only covered the sale of the land, not the house and lot, and the price indicated was only P188,340.00, not the amount of P800,000.00 [3] that she actually paid; that her signature and that of her husband, Douglas Ferguson (Douglas), were forged; that Atty. Ramos notarized the deed of sale without their presence; and that complainant and her husband neither appeared, executed nor acknowledged any document before Atty. Ramos as they never met him in person.\n\nIn his Comment, [4] Atty. Ramos denied that he represented the defendants in the case before the DAR but he admitted that he notarized their Answer. With respect to the charge of falsification of the April 24, 2009 Deed of Sale and the notarization of the aforementioned deed, Atty. Ramos likewise denied any participation and countered that his signature as a notary public was forged. Atty. Ramos, nonetheless, admitted that he notarized the \"genuine\" Deed of Sale, [5] dated May 12, 2009, executed between vendor Alfredo Inosanto, and vendees complainant and her spouse, involving the Same property for the amount of P300,000.00. [6] Atty. Ramos surmised that whoever benefited from such dastardly act could be the culprit in the falsification of the document as the forged deed of sale which indicated a lesser purchase price was the one presented in the Registry of Deeds of Bulacan in order to evade payment of a higher capital gains tax.\n\nIn its Resolution, [7] dated February 29, 2012 the Court referred the complaint to the Integrated Bar of the Philippines (IBP) for investigation, report and recommendation.\n\nThe case was then set by the Commission on Bar Discipline (CBD) of the IBP for mandatory conference. Thereafter, parties were required to submit their respective position papers.\n\nIn its Report and Recommendation, [8] dated November 21, 2014, the CBD found Atty. Ramos guilty of violating the law on notarial practice and recommended that he be suspended from the practice of law for a period of one (1) year and, in case he held a commission as a notary public; that it be revoked and that he be disqualified to act as a notary public for a period of two (2) years to be counted after his suspension. The CBD stated that the defense of forgery, without any corroborative evidence, was not credible. As to the charge. that of engaging in a private practice while employed in the government service against Atty. Ramos, the CBD opined that it should be addressed to the Civil Service Commission for the determination of his appropriate administrative liability.\n\nIn its Notice of Resolution No. XXI-2015-458, [9] dated June 6, 2015, the IBP-Board of Governors adopted and approved with modification the report and recommendation of the CBD, as follows:\n\nRESOLVED to ADOPT and APPROVE, as it is hereby ADOPTED and APPROVED, the Report and Recommendation of the Investigating Commissioner in the above-entitled case, herein made part of this Resolution as Annex \"A\", finding the recommendation to be fully supported by the evidence on record and applicable laws and Respondent's notarization of a document in the absence of the parties' in violation of the 2004 Rules on Notarial Practice. Thus, Respondent Atty. Salvador P. Ramos' notarial commission, if presently commissioned, is immediately REVOKED. Furthermore, he is DISQUALIFIED from being commissioned as a Notary Public for two (2) years and is SUSPENDED from the practice of law for six (6) months.\n\nThe Court agrees with the findings of the IBP but differs on the imposed penalty.\n\nSection 1, Public Act No. 2103, otherwise known as the Notarial Law states:\n\nThe acknowledgment shall be before a notary public or an officer duly authorized by law of the country to take acknowledgements of instruments or documents in the place where the act is done. The notary public or the officer taking the acknowledgment shall certify that the person acknowledging the instrument or document is known to him and that he is the same person who executed it, acknowledged that the same is his free act and deed. The certificate shall be made under the official seal, if he is required by law to keep a seal, and if not, his certificate shall so state.\nThe importance of the affiant's personal appearance was further emphasized in Section 2 (b), Rule IV of the Rules on Notarial Practice of 2004 which specifically provides that:\n\nA person shall not perform a notarial act if the person involved as signatory to the instrument or document \u2013\n\n[TABLE_CONTENT]\n(1) | is not in the notary's presence personally at the time of the notarization; and\n | \n(2) | is not personally known to the notary public or otherwise identified by the notary public through competent evidence of identity as defined by these Rules.\n[END_TABLE]\n\n(1) is not in the notary's presence personally at the time of the notarization; and (2) is not personally known to the notary public or otherwise identified by the notary public through competent evidence of identity as defined by these Rules.\nThe afore-quoted rules clearly mandate that a notary public, before notarizing a document, should require the presence of the very person who executed the same. Thus, he certifies that it was the same person who executed and personally appeared before him to attest to the contents and truth of what were stated therein. [10] The presence of the parties to the deed is necessary to enable the notary public to verify the genuineness of the signature of the affiant. [11]\n\nIn the present case, Atty. Ramos denied having notarized the April 24, 2009 deed of sale and claimed that his signature was forged. He even alluded that the person who benefited from it could be the forger as the capital gains tax liability was reduced. He, nonetheless, admitted notarizing the \"genuine\" deed of sale, dated May 12, 2009.\n\nRegardless of who the culprit was and the motive of such forgery, Atty. Ramos cannot be exonerated from liability. A perusal of the record would reveal that Douglas, one of the parties in the deed of sale, was not in the Philippines on May 12, 2009, the day the \"genuine\" deed of sale was notarized. Complainant presented a copy of Douglas' passport indicating that he entered the Philippines only on May 26, 2001 and left on June 12, 2001. This substantially established that indeed Douglas could not have personally appeared before Atty. Ramos when he notarized the deed.\n\nMoreover, an examination of the April 24, 2009 and May 12, 2009 deeds of sale disclosed that both documents bore the same document number, page number and book number of the notarial registry of Atty. Ramos. If, indeed, the April 24, 2009 deed of sale, which was issued earlier was forged, how would the purported culprit know the detail of Atty. Ramos' notarial registry?\n\nIt must be emphasized that notarization is not an empty, meaningless and routinary act. It is imbued with public interest. and only those who are qualified and authorized may act as notaries public. [12] In the case of Gonzales v. Ramos, [13] the Court explained the significance of the act of notarization, thus:\n\nBy affixing his notarial seal on the instrument, the respondent converted the Deed of Absolute Sale, from a private document into a public document. Such act is no empty gesture. The principal function of a notary public is to authenticate documents. When a notary public certifies to the due execution and delivery of a document under his hand and seal, he gives the document the force of evidence. Indeed, one of the purposes of requiring documents to be acknowledged before a notary public, in addition to the solemnity which should surround the execution and delivery of documents, is to authorize such documents to be given without further proof of their execution and delivery. A notarial document is by law entitled to full faith and credit upon its face. Courts, administrative agencies and the public at large must be able to rely upon the acknowledgement executed before a notary public and appended to a private instrument. Hence, a notary public must discharge his powers and duties, which are impressed with public interest, with accuracy and fidelity.\n\nNot only did Atty. Ramos fail to comply with the Rule on Notarial Practice when he notarized the deed of sale without the presence of the parties but he likewise violated Canon 1 of the Code of Professional Responsibility which obliges a lawyer to uphold the Constitution, obey the laws of the land and promote respect for the law and legal processes; and Rule 1.01, Canon 1 of the Code of Professional Responsibility which proscribes a lawyer from engaging in any unlawful, dishonest, immoral and deceitful conduct. [14]\n\nAs a lawyer commissioned as notary public, Atty. Ramos was mandated to exercise the function of his office and must observe with utmost care the basic formalities of his office and requisites in the performance of his duties. [15] When Atty. Ramos affixed his signature and notarial seal on the deed of sale, he led us to believe that the parties personally appeared before him and attested to the truth and veracity of the contents thereof. His conduct was fraught with dangerous possibilities considering the conclusiveness on the due execution of a document that our courts and the public accord on notarized documents. [16] Certainly, Atty. Ramos failed to exercise the functions of the office and to comply with the mandates of the law.\n\nIn the case of Santuyo v. Atty. Hidalgo, [17] the respondent lawyer similarly denied having notarized the subject deed of sale. The Court found him negligent not only in the supposed notarization but in allowing the office secretaries to make the necessary entries in his notarial registry which was supposed to be done and kept by him alone. He was suspended from his commissioned as notary public and was disqualified from being commissioned as notary public for a period of two years.\n\nIn the case of Ocampo-Ingcoco v. Atty. Yrreverre, Jr., [18] the respondent lawyer was suspended from the practice of law for a period of six (6) months for notarizing a document without the appearance of the parties. The Court held that a notary public should not notarize a document unless the persons who signed it are the very same persons who executed and personally appeared before him to attest to the truth of the contents therein.\n\nIn line with these cases, the Court finds the suspension of Atty. Ramos for six (6) months in order.\n\nWith respect to the allegation that Atty. Ramos was engaged in a private practice while employed in the government service, the Court agrees with the CBD that the issue should be brought before the Civil Service Commission for the determination of his appropriate administrative liability, if any.\n\nFinally, this Court cannot ignore the averments of Atty. Ramos that there were two (2) deeds of sale covering Transfer Certificate of Title No. CLOA-T-15831. One was the April 24, 2009 Deed of Sale which was presented to the Registry of Deeds of Bulacan, and the other one was the May 12, 2009 Deed of Sale which was kept on file at the Notarial Section of the RTC. Both deeds were registered in the Notarial Registry of Atty. Ramos with document number 354, page number 71 and Book VII series of 2009. Because of this irregularity, the Court deems it proper to refer this matter to the Bureau of Internal Revenue for the assessment of the correct tax and for investigation for possible prosecution of the criminal liability of the culprits under the National Internal Revenue Code.\n\nWHEREFORE, finding Atty. Salvador P. Ramos GUILTY of violating the Rule on Notarial Practice and Rule 1.01 and Canon 1 of the Code of Professional Responsibility, the Court hereby SUSPENDS him from the practice of law for six (6) months; REVOKES his notarial commission, effective immediately; and PERMANENTLY BARS him from being commissioned as notary public, with a STERN WARNING that a repetition of the same or similar conduct will be dealt with more severely.\n\nLet copies of this decision be furnished the Office of the Bar Confidant to be attached to the personal record of Atty. Salvador P. Ramos; the Office of the Court Administrator for dissemination to all lower courts; and the Integrated Bar of the Philippines, for proper guidance and information.\n\nThe Civil Service Commission and the Bureau of Internal Revenue should likewise be given copies of this decision for their appropriate actions.\n\nSO ORDERED.\n\nSereno, C.J., Carpio, Velasco, Jr., Leonardo-De Castro, Peralta, Del Castillo, Mendoza, Reyes, Perlas-Bernabe, Leonen, Jardeleza, Caguioa, Martires, and Tijam, JJ., concur.\n\nBersamin, J., no part.\n\nNOTICE OF JUDGMENT\n\nSirs/Mesdames:\n\nPlease take notice that on April 18, 2017 a Decision /Resolution, copy attached herewith, was rendered by the Supreme Court in the above-entitled administrative matters, the original of which was received by this Office on may 25, 2017 at 9:30 a.m.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\n(SGD.)

      "title": "PHILIPPINE GEOTHERMAL, INC. EMPLOYEES UNION (PGIEU), PETITIONER, CHEVRON GEOTHERMAL PHILS. HOLDINGS, INC., RESPONDENT. D E C I S I O N REYES, JR., J: This is a Petition for Review on Certiorari[1] pursuant to Rule 45 of the Rules of Court, as amended, seeking to reverse and set aside the Decision[2] dated November 5, 2012 of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. SP. No. 115796, dismissing the Petition for Review entitled \"Philippine Geothermal, Inc. Employees Union (PGIEU) vs. Chevron Geothermal Phils. Holdings, Inc.'' as well as the Resolution[3] dated May 17, 2013 denying Philippine Geothermal, Inc. Employees Union's (petitioner) Motion[4] for Reconsideration dated November 27, 2012. The Facts Petitioner is a legitimate labor organization and the certified bargaining agent of the rank-and-file employees of Chevron Geothermal Phils. Holdings, Inc. (respondent).[5] On July 31, 2008, the petitioner and respondent formally executed a Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA) which was made effective for the period from November 1, 2007 until October 31, 2012. Under Article VII, Section 1 thereof, there is a stipulation governing salary increases of the respondent's rank-and-file employees, as follows: Section 1. WAGE INCREASE The COMPANY will grant the following: - Effective Nov. 1, 2007, P260,000.00 - lump sum payment for the 1st year of this agreement (taxable). - Effective Nov. 1, 2008, across the board increase on the monthly salary in the amount of P1,500.00. - Effective Nov. 1, 2009, across the board increase on the monthly salary in the amount of P1,500.00.[6] In implementing the foregoing provision, the parties agreed on the following guidelines appended as Annex D of said CBA, viz.: Employment Status P260K P1500 P1500 Lump Sum (Nov. 1, 2008) (Nov. 1, 2009) Regularized on or before April 30, 2008 / / / Regularized between May 1, 2008 and October 31, 2008 X / / Regularized on or before April 30, 2009 X / / Regularized between May 1, 2009 and October 31, 2009 X X / Regularized on or before April 30, 2010 X X / On October 6, 2009, a letter dated September 20, 2009 was sent by the petitioner's President to respondent expressing, on behalf of its members, the concern that the aforesaid CBA provision and implementing rules were not being implemented properly pursuant to the guidelines and that, if not addressed, might result to a salary distortion among union members.[7] On even date, respondent responded by letter denying any occurrence of salary distortion among union members and reiterating its remuneration philosophy of having \"similar values for similar jobs\", which means that employees in similarly-valued jobs would have similar salary rates. It explained that to attain such objective, it made annual reviews and necessary adjustments of the employees' salaries and hiring rates based on the computed values for each job.[8] Finding the explanation not satisfactory, petitioner, with respondent's approval, referred the subject dispute to the Voluntary Arbitration of the National Conciliation and Mediation Board (NCMB). It averred that respondent breached their CBA provision on worker's wage increase because it granted salary increase even to probationary employees in contravention of the express mandate of that particular CBA article and implementing guidelines that salary increases were to be given only to regular employees.[9] To cite an example, petitioner alleged that respondent granted salary increases of One Thousand Five Hundred Pesos (P1,500.00) each to then probationary employees Sherwin Lanao (Lanao) and Jonel Cordovales (Cordovales) at a time when they have not yet attained regular status. They (Lanao and Cordovales) were regularized only on January 1, 2010 and April 16, 2010, respectively, yet they were given salary increase for November 1, 2008. As a consequence of their accelerated increases, wages of said probationary workers equated the wage rates of the regular employees, thereby obliterating the wage rates distinction based on merit, skills and length of service. Therefore, the petitioner insisted that its members' salaries must necessarily be increased so as to maintain the higher strata of their salaries from those of the probationary employees who were given the said premature salary increases.[10] On the other hand, respondent maintained that it did not commit any violation of that CBA provision and its implementing guidelines; in fact, it complied therewith. It reasoned that the questioned increases given to Lanao and Cordovales' salaries were granted, not during their probationary employment, but after they were already regularized. It further asseverated that there was actually no salary distortion in this case since the disparity or difference of salaries between Lanao and Cordovales with that of the other company employees were merely a result of their being hired on different dates, regularization at different occasions, and differences in their hiring rates at the time of their employment.[11] After due proceedings, the Voluntary Arbitrator rendered a Decision[12] dated August 16, 2010 in favor of respondent, ruling that petitioner failed to duly substantiate its allegations that the former prematurely gave salary increases to its probationary employees and that there was a resultant distortion in the salary scale of its regular employees.[13] Thereafter, a Petition[14] for Review under Rule 65 was filed with the CA on September 22, 2010. On November 5, 2012, the CA rendered its Decision.[15] It dismissed the petition for review and sustained the Voluntary Arbitrator's decision. The pertinent and dispositive portion of the assailed decision reads as follows: In fine, We hold that the Voluntary Arbitrator of NCMB did not commit grave abuse of discretion in dismissing petitioner union's complaint against respondent company. Settled is the rule that factual findings of labor officials who are deemed to have acquired expertise in matters within their jurisdiction, are generally accorded not only respect but even finality, and they are binding when supported by substantial evidence. In this case, these findings are supported by competent and convincing evidence. WHEREFORE, premises considered, the instant petition is DISMISSED. The Decision dated 16 August 2010 of the Voluntary Arbitrator of the NCMB Regional Branch No. IV is SUSTAINED. SO ORDERED.[16] On November 28, 2012, petitioner filed its Motion[17] for Reconsideration. This was, however, denied by the CA in its Resolution[18] dated May 17, 2013. Hence, this petition. The Issues I. WHETHER OR NOT THE CA GRAVELY ERRED IN HOLDING THAT RESPONDENT DID NOT VIOLATE THE CBA IN GRANTING WAGE INCREASE OF P1,500.00 TO LANAO AND CORDOVALES AT A TIME WHEN THEY HAD NOT YET ATTAINED REGULAR STATUS II. WHETHER OR NOT THE CA GRAVELY ERRED IN HOLDING THAT THE GRANT OF WAGE INCREASE TO LANAO AND CORDOVALES IS A VALID EXERCISE OF MANAGEMENT PREROGATIVES BY RESPONDENT III. WHETHER OR NOT THE CA ERRED IN NOT ORDERING RESPONDENT TO LIKEWISE INCREASE THE RATES OF OTHER REGULAR EMPLOYEES IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THEIR RATES AND THOSE OF THE EMPLOYEES WHO WERE ALLEGEDLY GRANTED PREMATURE WAGE INCREASES Ruling of the Court The petition is devoid of merit. Petitioner and respondent entered into an agreement whereby employees will be granted a wage increase depending on the date of their regularization, viz.: Employment Status P260K P1500 P1500 Lump Sum (Nov. 1, 2008) (Nov. 1, 2009) Regularized on or before April 30, 2008 / / / Regularized between May 1, 2008 and October 31, 2008 X / / Regularized on or before April 30, 2009 X / / Regularized between May 1, 2009 and October 31, 2009 X X / Regularized on or before April 30, 2010 X X / Petitioner claims that Lanao and Cordovales having been regularized only on January 1, 2010 and April 16, 2010, respectively, are not covered by the P260,000.00 lump sum and the initial P1500.00 wage increase effective on Nov. 1, 2008. It appears, however, that based on the actual pay slips of union members, Lanao and Cordovales both received wage increase in the amount of P1500.00 effective Nov. 1, 2008 and that such increase was immediately granted to them at the time of their hiring which resulted to the increase of their salaries to P36,500.00 per month. It is further stressed by petitioner that the increase granted by respondent to Lanao and Cordovales are violative of the terms of the CBA, specifically Section 1, Article VII and Annex D, for the reason that these employees have not yet attained \"Regular\" status at the time they were granted a wage increase and thus resulting to a salary/wage distortion. Respondent, for its part, claims that the alleged \"increase\" in the wages of these employees was not due to application of the provisions of Article VII and Annex D of the CBA, rather it was brought about by the increase in the hiring rates at the time these employees were hired. As a matter of fact, a careful scrutiny of the records reveals that respondent have complied with the terms agreed upon in the CBA. Notably, respondent's reply to the petitioner's letter accusing them of violation of the terms of the CBA and holding them responsible for the alleged wage distortion, clarified the ambiguity with regard to the hiring rates, viz.: As for the perceived salary distortion among Union members resulting from the non-implementation of the guidelines on Article VH-Salaries and Allowances, Section 1 - Wage Increase, Annex D of the CBA 2007-2012, we would like to reiterate our discussion during the recent NLMC meeting of September 16, on Chevron's remuneration philosophy of having \"similar value for similar jobs\" which simply states that employees in similarly valued jobs will have similar salary rates. Salaries and hiring rates are reviewed annually and adjusted as necessary based on the computed values of each job, an employee's tenure or seniority in his/her current position will not influence the value of the job.[19] (Underlining Ours) Clearly then, the increase in the salaries of Lanao and Cordovales was not pursuant to the wage increase agreed upon in CBA 2007-2012 rather it was the result of the increase in hiring rates at the time they were hired. To illustrate, in its Reply,[20] respondent discussed the difference in the hiring rates of employees Lanao and Robert Gawat, viz.: Mr. Robert Gawat was regularized on April 16, 2007 having been hired on October 16, 2007 while Mr. Lanao as shown in the Company's position paper was regularized on January 1, 2010, having been hired only on July 1, 2009. At the time of Mr. Gawat's hiring, the hiring rate for Pay Grade 12 was P31,800.00. On April 16, 2007, Mr. Gawat was given a CBA salary increase under the 2002-2007 CBA of P1,700.00 per month which increased his pay to P33,500.00 per month. He received another CBA salary increase of P1,500.00 under the 2007-2012 CBA on November 1, 2008, thus increasing his pay to P35,000.00. On November 1, 2009, he received another salary increase of P1,500.00 under the 2007-2012 CBA which further increased his pay to P36,500.00 per month until the present. On the other hand, when Mr. Lanao was hired on July 9, 2009, the hiring rate at the time for employees falling under Pay Grade 12 was already P35,000.00, having been adjusted by the company in accordance with market and industry practice. On January 1, 2010, Mr. Lanao was regularized and as dictated by the CBA, he was given a CBA salary increase of P1,500.00 per month effective January 1, 2010 which increased his monthly pay at the present to P36,500.00.[21] (Emphasis and underlining Ours) As shown above, the respondent never violated the CBA and in fact, complied with it to the letter. Clearly, the petitioner only used the respondent's alleged violation of the CBA when its true gripe is related to the respondent's prerogative of setting the hiring rate of the employees over which the petitioner neither has the personality nor the privilege to meddle or interfere with.[22] The second and third issue, being interrelated, shall be discussed jointly. Upon the enactment of Republic Act (R.A.) No. 6727 (Wage Rationalization Act, amending among others, Article 124 of the Labor Code) on June 9, 1989, the term \"Wage Distortion\" was explicitly defined as \"a situation where an increase in prescribed wage rates results in the elimination or severe contraction of intentional quantitative differences in wage or salary rate between and among employee groups an establishment as to effectively obliterate the distinctions embodied in such wage structure based on skills, length of service or other logical bases of differentiation.\"[23] Contrary to petitioner's claim of alleged \"wage distortion\", Article 124 of the Labor Code of the Philippines only cover wage adjustments and increases due to a prescribed law or wage order, viz.: Article 124. Standards/Criteria for Minimum Wage Fixing. x x x x Where the application of any prescribed wage increase by virtue of a law or Wage Order issued by any Regional Board results in distortions of the wage structure within an establishment, the employer and union shall negotiate to correct the distortions. Any dispute arising from the wage distortions shall be resolved through the grievance procedure under their collective bargaining agreement and, if it remains unresolved, through voluntary arbitration.[24] (Emphasis Ours) Prubankers Association v. Prudential Bank and Trust Company[25] laid down the four elements of wage distortion, to wit: (1) an existing hierarchy of positions with corresponding salary rates; (2) a significant change in the salary rate of a lower pay class without a concomitant increase in the salary rate of a higher one; (3) the elimination of the distinction between the two levels; and (4) the existence of the distortion in the same region of the country. The apparent increase in Lanao and Cordovales' salaries as compared to the other company workers who also have the same salary/pay grade with them should not be interpreted to mean that they were given a premature increase for November 1, 2008, thus resulting to a wage distortion. The alleged increase in their salaries was not a result of the erroneous application of Article VII and Annex D of the CBA, rather, it was because when they were hired by respondent in 2009, when the hiring rates were relatively higher as compared to those of the previous years. Verily, the setting and implementation of such various engagement rates were purely an exercise of the respondent's business prerogative in order to attract or lure the best possible applicants in the market and which We will not interfere with, absent any showing that it was exercised in bad faith. Management prerogative gives an employer freedom to regulate according to their discretion and best judgment, all aspects of employment including work assignment, working methods, the processes to be followed, working regulations, transfer of employees, work supervision, lay-off of workers and the discipline, dismissal and recall of workers.[26] This right is tempered only by these limitations: that it must be exercised in good faith and with due regard to the rights of the employees.[27] Petitioner claims that the wages of other employees should also be increased in order to maintain the difference between their salaries and those of employees granted a \"premature\" wage increase. Such a situation may be remedied if it falls under the concept of a wage distortion as defined by Article 124 of the Labor Code of the Philippines. However, as already discussed, there is no wage distortion in the case at bench. Not all increases in salary which obliterate the salary differences of certain employees should be perceived as wage distortion. In the case of Bankard Employees Union-Workers Alliance Trade Unions v. National Labor Relations Commission,[28] the Court discussed the possible implication of an expanded interpretation of the concept of Wage Distortion, to wit: If the compulsory mandate under Article 124 to correct \"wage distortion\" is applied to voluntary and unilateral increases by the employer in fixing hiring rates which is inherently a business judgment prerogative, then the hands of the employer would be completely tied even in cases where an increase in wages of a particular group is justified due to a re-evaluation of the high productivity of a particular group, or as in the present case, the need to increase the competitiveness of Bankard's hiring rate. An employer would be discouraged from adjusting the salary rates of a particular group of employees for fear that it would result to a demand by all employees for a similar increase, especially if the financial conditions the business cannot address an across-the-board increase.[29] The Court's ruling in the case of Bankard seek to address and resolve conflicting opinions regarding the true concept of a wage distortion like the one presented in this case whereby a legitimate exercise by an employer of its management prerogative is being taken against it in the guise of an allegation that it is circumventing labor laws. An employer should not be held hostage by the whims and caprices of its employees especially when it has faithfully complied with and executed the terms of the CBA. It is the prerogative of management to regulate, according to its discretion and judgment all aspects of employment. This flows from the established rule that labor law does not authorize the substitution of the judgment of the employer in the conduct of its business. Such management prerogative may be availed of without fear of any liability so long as it is exercised in good faith for the advancement of the employer's interest and not for the purpose of defeating or circumventing the rights of the employees under special laws or agreements and are not exercised in a malicious, harsh, oppressive, vindictive or wanton manner or out of malice or spite.[30] On a final note, the Court has ruled time and again that factual findings of labor officials, who are deemed to have acquired expertise in matters within their jurisdiction, are generally accorded not only respect but even finality by the courts when supported by substantial evidence and affirmed by the CA, in the exercise of its expanded jurisdiction to review findings of the National Labor Relations Commission.

HOLDINGS, INC., RESPONDENT.\n\nD E C I S I O N\n\nREYES, JR., J:\n\nThis is a Petition for Review on Certiorari [1] pursuant to Rule 45 of the Rules of Court, as amended, seeking to reverse and set aside the Decision [2] dated November 5, 2012 of the Court of Appeals (CA) in CA-G.R. SP. No. 115796, dismissing the Petition for Review entitled \" Philippine Geothermal, Inc. Employees Union (PGIEU) vs. Chevron Geothermal Phils. Holdings, Inc .'' as well as the Resolution [3] dated May 17, 2013 denying Philippine Geothermal, Inc. Employees Union's (petitioner) Motion [4] for Reconsideration dated November 27, 2012.\n\nThe Facts\n\nPetitioner is a legitimate labor organization and the certified bargaining agent of the rank-and-file employees of Chevron Geothermal Phils. Holdings, Inc. (respondent). [5]\n\nOn July 31, 2008, the petitioner and respondent formally executed a Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA) which was made effective for the period from November 1, 2007 until October 31, 2012. Under Article VII, Section 1 thereof, there is a stipulation governing salary increases of the respondent's rank-and-file employees, as follows:\n\nSection 1. WAGE INCREASE\n\nThe COMPANY will grant the following:\n\n- Effective Nov. 1, 2007, P260,000.00 - lump sum payment for the 1 st year of this agreement (taxable).\n- Effective Nov. 1, 2008, across the board increase on the monthly salary in the amount of P1,500.00.\n- Effective Nov. 1, 2009, across the board increase on the monthly salary in the amount of P1,500.00. [6]\n\nIn implementing the foregoing provision, the parties agreed on the following guidelines appended as Annex D of said CBA, viz .:\n\n[TABLE_CONTENT]\nEmployment Status | P260K | P1500 | P1500\n | Lump Sum | (Nov. 1, 2008) | (Nov. 1, 2009)\nRegularized on or before April 30, 2008 | / | / | /\nRegularized between May 1, 2008 and October 31, 2008 | X | / | /\nRegularized on or before April 30, 2009 | X | / | /\nRegularized between May 1, 2009 and October 31, 2009 | X | X | /\nRegularized on or before April 30, 2010 | X | X | /\n[END_TABLE]\n\nEmployment Status P260K P1500 P1500 Lump Sum (Nov. 1, 2008) (Nov. 1, 2009) Regularized on or before April 30, 2008 / /\n/ Regularized between May 1, 2008 and October 31, 2008 X / / Regularized on or before April 30, 2009 X / / Regularized between May 1, 2009 and October 31, 2009 X X / Regularized on or before April 30, 2010 X X /\n\nOn October 6, 2009, a letter dated September 20, 2009 was sent by the petitioner's President to respondent expressing, on behalf of its members, the concern that the aforesaid CBA provision and implementing rules were not being implemented properly pursuant to the guidelines and that, if not addressed, might result to a salary distortion among union members. [7]\n\nOn even date, respondent responded by letter denying any occurrence of salary distortion among union members and reiterating its remuneration philosophy of having \"similar values for similar jobs\", which means that employees in similarly-valued jobs would have similar salary rates. It explained that to attain such objective, it made annual reviews and necessary adjustments of the employees' salaries and hiring rates based on the computed values for each job. [8]\n\nFinding the explanation not satisfactory, petitioner, with respondent's approval, referred the subject dispute to the Voluntary Arbitration of the National Conciliation and Mediation Board (NCMB). It averred that respondent breached their CBA provision on worker's wage increase because it granted salary increase even to probationary employees in contravention of the express mandate of that particular CBA article and implementing guidelines that salary increases were to be given only to regular employees. [9]\n\nTo cite an example, petitioner alleged that respondent granted salary increases of One Thousand Five Hundred Pesos (P1,500.00) each to then probationary employees Sherwin Lanao (Lanao) and Jonel Cordovales (Cordovales) at a time when they have not yet attained regular status. They (Lanao and Cordovales) were regularized only on January 1, 2010 and April 16, 2010, respectively, yet they were given salary increase for November 1, 2008. As a consequence of their accelerated increases, wages of said probationary workers equated the wage rates of the regular employees, thereby obliterating the wage rates distinction based on merit, skills and length of service. Therefore, the petitioner insisted that its members' salaries must necessarily be increased so as to maintain the higher strata of their salaries from those of the probationary employees who were given the said premature salary increases. [10]\n\nOn the other hand, respondent maintained that it did not commit any violation of that CBA provision and its implementing guidelines; in fact, it complied therewith. It reasoned that the questioned increases given to Lanao and Cordovales' salaries were granted, not during their probationary employment, but after they were already regularized. It further asseverated that there was actually no salary distortion in this case since the disparity or difference of salaries between Lanao and Cordovales with that of the other company employees were merely a result of their being hired on different dates, regularization at different occasions, and differences in their hiring rates at the time of their employment. [11]\n\nAfter due proceedings, the Voluntary Arbitrator rendered a Decision [12] dated August 16, 2010 in favor of respondent, ruling that petitioner failed to duly substantiate its allegations that the former prematurely gave salary increases to its probationary employees and that there was a resultant distortion in the salary scale of its regular employees. [13]\n\nThereafter, a Petition [14] for Review under Rule 65 was filed with the CA on September 22, 2010.\n\nOn November 5, 2012, the CA rendered its Decision. [15] It dismissed the petition for review and sustained the Voluntary Arbitrator's decision. The pertinent and dispositive portion of the assailed decision reads as follows:\n\nIn fine, We hold that the Voluntary Arbitrator of NCMB did not commit grave abuse of discretion in dismissing petitioner union's complaint against respondent company. Settled is the rule that factual findings of labor officials who are deemed to have acquired expertise in matters within their jurisdiction, are generally accorded not only respect but even finality, and they are binding when supported by substantial evidence. In this case, these findings are supported by competent and convincing evidence.\n\nWHEREFORE , premises considered, the instant petition is DISMISSED . The Decision dated 16 August 2010 of the Voluntary Arbitrator of the NCMB Regional Branch No. IV is SUSTAINED .\n\nSO ORDERED. [16]\n\nOn November 28, 2012, petitioner filed its Motion [17] for Reconsideration. This was, however, denied by the CA in its Resolution [18] dated May 17, 2013.\n\nHence, this petition.\n\nThe Issues\n\nI.\n\nWHETHER OR NOT THE CA GRAVELY ERRED IN HOLDING THAT RESPONDENT DID NOT VIOLATE THE CBA IN GRANTING WAGE INCREASE OF P1,500.00 TO LANAO AND CORDOVALES AT A TIME WHEN THEY HAD NOT YET ATTAINED REGULAR STATUS\n\nII.\n\nWHETHER OR NOT THE CA GRAVELY ERRED IN HOLDING THAT THE GRANT OF WAGE INCREASE TO LANAO AND CORDOVALES IS A VALID EXERCISE OF MANAGEMENT PREROGATIVES BY RESPONDENT\n\nIII.\n\nWHETHER OR NOT THE CA ERRED IN NOT ORDERING RESPONDENT TO LIKEWISE INCREASE THE RATES OF OTHER REGULAR EMPLOYEES IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THEIR RATES AND THOSE OF THE EMPLOYEES WHO WERE ALLEGEDLY GRANTED PREMATURE WAGE INCREASES\n\nRuling of the Court\n\nThe petition is devoid of merit.\n\nPetitioner and respondent entered into an agreement whereby employees will be granted a wage increase depending on the date of their regularization, viz .:\n\n[TABLE_CONTENT]\nEmployment Status | P260K | P1500 | P1500\n | Lump Sum | (Nov. 1, 2008) | (Nov. 1, 2009)\nRegularized on or before April 30, 2008 | / | / | /\nRegularized between May 1, 2008 and October 31, 2008 | X | / | /\nRegularized on or before April 30, 2009 | X | / | /\nRegularized between May 1, 2009 and October 31, 2009 | X | X | /\nRegularized on or before April 30, 2010 | X | X | /\n[END_TABLE]\n\nEmployment Status P260K P1500 P1500 Lump Sum (Nov. 1, 2008) (Nov. 1, 2009) Regularized on or before April 30, 2008 / / /\nRegularized between May 1, 2008 and October 31, 2008 X /\n/\nRegularized on or before April 30, 2009 X /\n/\nRegularized between May 1, 2009 and October 31, 2009 X X /\nRegularized on or before April 30, 2010 X X /\n\nPetitioner claims that Lanao and Cordovales having been regularized only on January 1, 2010 and April 16, 2010, respectively, are not covered by the P260,000.00 lump sum and the initial P1500.00 wage increase effective on Nov. 1, 2008. It appears, however, that based on the actual pay slips of union members, Lanao and Cordovales both received wage increase in the amount of P1500.00 effective Nov. 1, 2008 and that such increase was immediately granted to them at the time of their hiring which resulted to the increase of their salaries to P36,500.00 per month.\n\nIt is further stressed by petitioner that the increase granted by respondent to Lanao and Cordovales are violative of the terms of the CBA, specifically Section 1, Article VII and Annex D, for the reason that these employees have not yet attained \"Regular\" status at the time they were granted a wage increase and thus resulting to a salary/wage distortion.\n\nRespondent, for its part, claims that the alleged \"increase\" in the wages of these employees was not due to application of the provisions of Article VII and Annex D of the CBA, rather it was brought about by the increase in the hiring rates at the time these employees were hired. As a matter of fact, a careful scrutiny of the records reveals that respondent have complied with the terms agreed upon in the CBA.\n\nNotably, respondent's reply to the petitioner's letter accusing them of violation of the terms of the CBA and holding them responsible for the alleged wage distortion, clarified the ambiguity with regard to the hiring rates, viz .:\n\nAs for the perceived salary distortion among Union members resulting from the non-implementation of the guidelines on Article VH-Salaries and Allowances, Section 1 - Wage Increase, Annex D of the CBA 2007-2012, we would like to reiterate our discussion during the recent NLMC meeting of September 16, on Chevron's remuneration philosophy of having \"similar value for similar jobs\" which simply states that employees in similarly valued jobs will have similar salary rates. Salaries and hiring rates are reviewed annually and adjusted as necessary based on the computed values of each job, an employee's tenure or seniority in his/her current position will not influence the value of the job. [19] (Underlining Ours)\n\nClearly then, the increase in the salaries of Lanao and Cordovales was not pursuant to the wage increase agreed upon in CBA 2007-2012 rather it was the result of the increase in hiring rates at the time they were hired.\n\nTo illustrate, in its Reply , [20] respondent discussed the difference in the hiring rates of employees Lanao and Robert Gawat, viz .:\n\nMr. Robert Gawat was regularized on April 16, 2007 having been hired on October 16, 2007 while Mr. Lanao as shown in the Company's position paper was regularized on January 1, 2010, having been hired only on July 1, 2009. At the time of Mr. Gawat's hiring, the hiring rate for Pay Grade 12 was P31,800.00 . On April 16, 2007, Mr. Gawat was given a CBA salary increase under the 2002-2007 CBA of P1,700.00 per month which increased his pay to P33,500.00 per month. He received another CBA salary increase of P1,500.00 under the 2007-2012 CBA on November 1, 2008, thus increasing his pay to P35,000.00. On November 1, 2009, he received another salary increase of P1,500.00 under the 2007-2012 CBA which further increased his pay to P36,500.00 per month until the present.\n\nOn the other hand, when Mr. Lanao was hired on July 9, 2009, the hiring rate at the time for employees falling under Pay Grade 12 was already P35,000.00 , having been adjusted by the company in accordance with market and industry practice. On January 1, 2010, Mr. Lanao was regularized and as dictated by the CBA, he was given a CBA salary increase of P1,500.00 per month effective January 1, 2010 which increased his monthly pay at the present to P36,500.00. [21] (Emphasis and underlining Ours)\n\nAs shown above, the respondent never violated the CBA and in fact, complied with it to the letter. Clearly, the petitioner only used the respondent's alleged violation of the CBA when its true gripe is related to the respondent's prerogative of setting the hiring rate of the employees over which the petitioner neither has the personality nor the privilege to meddle or interfere with. [22]\n\nThe second and third issue, being interrelated, shall be discussed jointly.\n\nUpon the enactment of Republic Act (R.A.) No. 6727 (Wage Rationalization Act, amending among others, Article 124 of the Labor Code) on June 9, 1989, the term \" Wage Distortion\" was explicitly defined as \"a situation where an increase in prescribed wage rates results in the elimination or severe contraction of intentional quantitative differences in wage or salary rate between and among employee groups an establishment as to effectively obliterate the distinctions embodied in such wage structure based on skills, length of service or other logical bases of differentiation. \" [23]\n\nContrary to petitioner's claim of alleged \"wage distortion\", Article 124 of the Labor Code of the Philippines only cover wage adjustments and increases due to a prescribed law or wage order , viz .:\n\nArticle 124. Standards/Criteria for Minimum Wage Fixing .\n\nx x x x\n\nWhere the application of any prescribed wage increase by virtue of a law or Wage Order issued by any Regional Board results in distortions of the wage structure within an establishment, the employer and union shall negotiate to correct the distortions. Any dispute arising from the wage distortions shall be resolved through the grievance procedure under their collective bargaining agreement and, if it remains unresolved, through voluntary arbitration. [24] (Emphasis Ours)\n\nPrubankers Association v. Prudential Bank and Trust Company [25] laid down the four elements of wage distortion, to wit: (1) an existing hierarchy of positions with corresponding salary rates; (2) a significant change in the salary rate of a lower pay class without a concomitant increase in the salary rate of a higher one; (3) the elimination of the distinction between the two levels; and (4) the existence of the distortion in the same region of the country.\n\nThe apparent increase in Lanao and Cordovales' salaries as compared to the other company workers who also have the same salary/pay grade with them should not be interpreted to mean that they were given a premature increase for November 1, 2008, thus resulting to a wage distortion. The alleged increase in their salaries was not a result of the erroneous application of Article VII and Annex D of the CBA, rather, it was because when they were hired by respondent in 2009, when the hiring rates were relatively higher as compared to those of the previous years. Verily, the setting and implementation of such various engagement rates were purely an exercise of the respondent's business prerogative in order to attract or lure the best possible applicants in the market and which We will not interfere with, absent any showing that it was exercised in bad faith.\n\nManagement prerogative gives an employer freedom to regulate according to their discretion and best judgment, all aspects of employment including work assignment, working methods, the processes to be followed, working regulations, transfer of employees, work supervision, lay-off of workers and the discipline, dismissal and recall of workers. [26] This right is tempered only by these limitations: that it must be exercised in good faith and with due regard to the rights of the employees. [27]\n\nPetitioner claims that the wages of other employees should also be increased in order to maintain the difference between their salaries and those of employees granted a \"premature\" wage increase. Such a situation may be remedied if it falls under the concept of a wage distortion as defined by Article 124 of the Labor Code of the Philippines. However, as already discussed, there is no wage distortion in the case at bench. Not all increases in salary which obliterate the salary differences of certain employees should be perceived as wage distortion.\n\nIn the case of Bankard Employees Union-Workers Alliance Trade Unions v. National Labor Relations Commission , [28] the Court discussed the possible implication of an expanded interpretation of the concept of Wage Distortion, to wit:\n\nIf the compulsory mandate under Article 124 to correct \"wage distortion\" is applied to voluntary and unilateral increases by the employer in fixing hiring rates which is inherently a business judgment prerogative, then the hands of the employer would be completely tied even in cases where an increase in wages of a particular group is justified due to a re-evaluation of the high productivity of a particular group, or as in the present case, the need to increase the competitiveness of Bankard's hiring rate. An employer would be discouraged from adjusting the salary rates of a particular group of employees for fear that it would result to a demand by all employees for a similar increase, especially if the financial conditions the business cannot address an across-the-board increase. [29]\n\nThe Court's ruling in the case of Bankard seek to address and resolve conflicting opinions regarding the true concept of a wage distortion like the one presented in this case whereby a legitimate exercise by an employer of its management prerogative is being taken against it in the guise of an allegation that it is circumventing labor laws. An employer should not be held hostage by the whims and caprices of its employees especially when it has faithfully complied with and executed the terms of the CBA.\n\nIt is the prerogative of management to regulate, according to its discretion and judgment all aspects of employment. This flows from the established rule that labor law does not authorize the substitution of the judgment of the employer in the conduct of its business. Such management prerogative may be availed of without fear of any liability so long as it is exercised in good faith for the advancement of the employer's interest and not for the purpose of defeating or circumventing the rights of the employees under special laws or agreements and are not exercised in a malicious, harsh, oppressive, vindictive or wanton manner or out of malice or spite. [30]\n\nOn a final note, the Court has ruled time and again that factual findings of labor officials, who are deemed to have acquired expertise in matters within their jurisdiction, are generally accorded not only respect but even finality by the courts when supported by substantial evidence and affirmed by the CA, in the exercise of its expanded jurisdiction to review findings of the National Labor Relations Commission.\n\nWHEREFORE , premises considered, the petition is DENIED .

JR., J.: Assailed in this petition for review on certiorari are the August 5, 2013 Decision[1] and the February 19, 2014 Resolution[2] of the Court of Tax Appeals (CTA) En Banc in CTA EB Case No. 907 which affirmed the February 28, 2012 Amended Decision[3] and the May 14, 2012 Resolution[4] of the CTA First Division in CTA Case No. 7842.The AntecedentsOn May 30, 2007, respondent Transfield Philippines, Inc. (respondent) received copies of Final Assessment Notice (FAN) Nos. LTDO-122-IT-2002-00014, LTDO-122-WE-2002-00011, LTDO-122-VT-2002-00012, and LTDO-122-PEN-2002-00002 issued by petitioner Commissioner of Internal Revenue (CIR), through Nestor S. Valeroso, Officer-in-Charge, Assistant Commissioner for the Large Taxpayers Service.[5] Respondent was assessed the total sum of P563,168,996.70 for deficiency income tax, Expanded Withholding Tax (EWT), and Value-Added Tax (VAT), inclusive of interest and compromise penalties for the Fiscal Year July 1, 2001 to June 30, 2002. The details of the assessments are as follows: Kind of Tax Basic Interest Compromise Total Income Tax291,320,169.28271,335,605.6725,000.00562,680,774.95 EWT66,497.5669,996.2814,000.00150,493.84 VAT147,156.30164,071.6124,500.00335,727.91 VAT penalty 2,000.002,000.00 Total291,533,823.14271,569,673.5665,500.00563,168,996.70 On June 5, 2007, respondent filed a protest with the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR).[6] Without acting on respondent's protest, the BIR issued the First Collection Letter[7] dated August 3, 2007, demanding immediate payment of the assessments. Respondent received a copy of the First Collection Letter on August 28, 2007.Then, on January 17, 2008, petitioner constructively served a Final Notice Before Seizure[8] dated December 20, 2007, to respondent's office.On February 29, 2008, respondent availed of the benefits of Republic Act (R.A.) No. 9480 by submitting the following documents to the Development Bank of the Philippines (DBP), an authorized agent bank of the BIR: 1) Notice of Availment of Tax Amnesty; 2) Tax Amnesty Return (BIR Form No. 2116); 3) Statement of Assets, Liabilities and Net Worth (SALN) as of December 31, 2005; and 4) Tax Amnesty Payment Form (BIR Form No. 0617). On the same day, respondent paid the BIR, through DBP, an amnesty tax in the amount of P112,500.00. On April 23, 2008, respondent paid P2,000.00 to the BIR in relation to FAN No. LTDO-122-PEN-2002-00002 for compromise penalties on alleged failure to file summary of sales and purchase from the first and second quarters of 2002.On May 5, 2008, respondent informed the BIR Large Taxpayers District Office (LTDO) of Makati City in a letter dated April 28, 2008, that it availed of the benefits of R.A. No. 9480 and furnished the LTDO with copies of the tax amnesty documents.[9] The said letter was received by the BIR LTDO of Makati City on the same day.On July 10, 2008, petitioner wrote respondent, advising the latter that under Revenue Memorandum Circular (RMC) No. 19-2008, those \"with delinquent accounts/accounts receivable considered as assets of the BIR/ Government, including self-assessed tax,\" are not allowed to avail of the benefits of R.A. No. 9480.[10]On September 8, 2008, petitioner issued a Warrant of Distraint and/or Levy (WDAL) directing the seizure of respondent's goods, chattels or effects, and other personal properties, and/or levy of its real property and interest in/or rights to real property to the extent of P563,168,996.70.[11] A copy of the WDAL was constructively served on respondent's offices on September 11, 2008. On the same day, the Bank of the Philippine Islands (BPI) informed respondent that the latter's account was being put on hold because of the WDAL.The CTA First Division RulingIn an Amended Decision[12] dated February 28, 2012, the CTA First Division ruled that the CTA has jurisdiction not only over decisions or inactions of the CIR in cases involving disputed assessments, refunds of internal revenue taxes, fees or other charges, penalties in relation thereto, but also over other matters arising under the National Internal Revenue Code (NIRC) or other laws administered by the BIR. It declared that petitioner is already barred from collecting from respondent the alleged tax liabilities because it is undisputed that respondent had complied with all the legal requirements pertaining to its application for tax amnesty by submitting to the BIR its Notice of Availment of Tax Amnesty, Tax Amnesty Return, SALN, and Tax Amnesty Payment Form together with the BIR Tax Payment Deposit Slip evidencing payment of amnesty tax amounting to P112,500.00. The CTA First Division added that when respondent complied with all the requirements of R.A. No. 9480, it is deemed to have settled in full all its tax liabilities for the years covered by the tax amnesty. It held that the July 10, 2008 Letter of petitioner is void as it disqualifies respondent from availing of the immunity from payment of tax liabilities under R.A. No. 9480 on the ground that its account has been considered delinquent or receivable asset of the government, which reason is not in consonance with the provisions of R.A. No. 9480. The fallo reads:WHEREFORE, the Motion for Reconsideration (from the Decision dated 20 September 2011) dated October 11, 2011 filed by petitioner is hereby GRANTED.Consequently, the Warrant of Distraint and/or Levy dated September 08, 2008 is hereby declared NULL and VOID and of no legal effect. Respondent is now precluded from collecting the amount of P563,168,996.70, representing petitioner's tax liability for taxable year 2002, which is deemed settled.SO ORDERED.[13]Petitioner moved for reconsideration, but the same was denied by the CTA First Division in a Resolution[14] dated May 14, 2012. Aggrieved, petitioner filed a petition for review before the CTA En Banc.The CTA En Banc RulingIn a Decision[15] dated August 5, 2013, the CTA En Banc opined that it has jurisdiction to rule on the petition because it is not an appeal of the disputed assessment which is subject to a reglementary period, but it is a case to determine whether the issuance of the WDAL is proper. It added that the issue to be addressed is not the timeliness of the protest, but rather, whether petitioner may validly collect taxes from respondent despite the latter having availed of the tax amnesty. The CTA En Banc concluded that respondent properly availed of the immunity from payment of taxes under R.A. No. 9480, and as such, the issuance of a WDAL was invalid, which justified the filing of a petition within 30 days from receipt of the warrant. It disposed the case in this wise:WHEREFORE, the petition is DENIED. The Amended Decision dated February 28, 2012, rendered by the First Division of this Court in CTA Case No. 7842, and its Resolution dated May 14, 2012 are AFFIRMED. No pronouncement as to costs.SO ORDERED.[16]Petitioner moved for reconsideration, but the same was denied by the CTA En Banc on February 19, 2014. Hence, this petition for review on certiorari, wherein petitioner raises the following issues: WHETHER THE CTA COMMITTED REVERSIBLE ERROR WHEN IT ASSUMED JURISDICTION OVER THE CASE. WHETHER THE CTA COMMITTED REVERSIBLE ERROR WHEN IT RULED THAT RESPONDENT IS ENTITLED TO THE IMMUNITIES UNDER THE TAX AMNESTY PROGRAM PROVIDED IN REPUBLIC ACT NO. 9480.[17] Petitioner argues that Section 9 of R.A. No. 9282 provides that a party adversely affected by a decision, ruling or inaction of the CIR may file an appeal with the CTA within 30 days after the receipt of such decision or ruling; that the 30-day period for filing an appeal with the CTA should be reckoned from respondent's receipt of the Final Notice Before Seizure, or at the latest, its receipt of the Letter dated July 10, 2008; that it is erroneous to consider receipt of the WDAL as the date of reckoning the period to file an appeal to the CTA because the WDAL is merely a means, an instrument, or a mechanism to implement the Final Notice Before Seizure, or at the latest, the July 10, 2008 Letter; that whatever decision, action, or ruling petitioner had with respect to respondent's claims and/or defenses was set forth in the aforementioned issuances and not in the WDAL; and that in providing for the exception that delinquent accounts, or accounts receivable considered assets of the government are not eligible under the tax amnesty program, RMC No. 19-2008 merely supplied the gap in the law where assessments have become final and incontestable upon the lapse of the reglementary period for appeal.[18]In its Comment,[19] respondent counters that the CTA is vested with jurisdiction to determine whether a taxpayer is immune from the payment of taxes insofar as it is given the exclusive appellate jurisdiction to review by appeal matters arising from the laws administered by the BIR such as tax amnesty statutes; that in Pantoja v. David,[20] the Court ruled that petitions for the annulment of distraint orders of the BIR do not violate the prohibition against injunctions to restrain the collection of taxes because the proceedings were not directed against the right of the BIR to collect per se, but against the right of the BIR to do so by distraint and levy; that while it did not file any petition for review from its receipt of the Final Notice Before Seizure, or the July 10, 2008 Letter, it availed of the tax amnesty on February 29, 2008 by complying with the requirements of R.A. No. 9480; that in CS Garment, Inc. v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue,[21] the Court ruled that a taxpayer immediately enjoys the immunities granted by R.A. No. 9480 as soon as the taxpayer complies with the conditions under the law and the BIR may not prevent or delay a taxpayer from immediately enjoying immunity from the payment of taxes by making the tax amnesty application contingent on the BIR's confirmation or agreement; that in Union Bank of the Philippines v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue,[22] decided by the CTA, the latter held that Section 4 of R.A. No. 9480 limits petitioner's remedy to assailing the taxpayer's SALN within a period of one year from the date of filing; that after the one-year period mandated by R.A. No. 9480, the tax amnesty could no longer be disputed by the BIR; and that to allow petitioner to enforce collection of assessments covered by the amnesty availed by respondent through the perfunctory and summary issuance of a WDAL would sanction a disregard of the law, and to punish respondent for its compliance therewith.In its Reply,[23] petitioner contends that the July 10, 2008 Letter was the adverse decision or ruling appealable to the CTA and respondent's receipt of the letter is the proper reckoning point for filing a petition for review with the CTA; that respondent received the said letter on August 5, 2008, thus, it was already apprised of petitioner's adverse decision regarding its application for tax amnesty at that time; that respondent had until September 4, 2008 to appeal the decision, however, respondent's petition for review was filed with the CTA only on October 10, 2008; and that assessments which have become final and executory upon the taxpayer's failure to appeal therefrom are outside the coverage of R.A. No. 9480.The Court's RulingI.A tax amnesty operates as a general pardon or intentional overlooking by the State of its authority to impose penalties on persons otherwise guilty of evasion or violation of a revenue or tax law. It is an absolute forgiveness or waiver by the government of its right to collect what is due it and to give tax evaders who wish to relent a chance to start with a clean slate. A tax amnesty, much like a tax exemption, is never favored nor presumed in law. The grant of a tax amnesty is akin to a tax exemption; thus, it must be construed strictly against the taxpayer and liberally in favor of the taxing authority.[24]On May 24, 2007, R.A. No. 9480 took effect and authorized the grant of a tax amnesty to qualified taxpayers for all national internal revenue taxes for the taxable year 2005 and prior years, with or without assessments duly issued therefor, that have remained unpaid as of December 31, 2005.[25] The pertinent provisions of R.A. No. 9480 are:SEC. 1. Coverage. \u2014 There is hereby authorized and granted a tax amnesty which shall cover all national internal revenue taxes for the taxable year 2005 and prior years, with or without assessments duly issued therefor, That have remained unpaid as of December 31, 2005: Provided, however, that the amnesty hereby authorized and granted shall not cover persons or cases enumerated under Section 8 hereof.x x x xSEC. 6. Immunities and Privileges. \u2014 Those who availed themselves of the tax amnesty under Section 5 hereof, and have fully complied with all its conditions shall be entitled to the following immunities and privileges:(a) The taxpayer shall be immune from the payment of taxes, as well as additions thereto, and the appurtenant civil, criminal or administrative penalties under the National Internal Revenue Code of 1997, as amended, arising from the failure to pay any and all internal revenue taxes for taxable year 2005 and prior years. (Emphases supplied)x x x xTo implement R.A. No. 9480, the Department of Finance (DOF) issued DOF Department Order No. 29-07 (DO 29-07). Section 6 thereof outlines the method for availing a tax amnesty under R.A. No. 9480, viz.:SEC. 6. Method of Availment of Tax Amnesty.1. Forms/Documents to be filed. \u2014 To avail of the general tax amnesty, concerned taxpayers shall file the following documents/requirements:a. Notice of Availment in such form as may be prescribed by the BIR;b. Statement of Assets, Liabilities and Networth (SALN) as of December 31, 2005 in such [form], as may be prescribed by the BIR;c. Tax Amnesty Return in such form as may be prescribed by the BIR.2. Place of Filing of Amnesty Tax Return. \u2014 The Tax Amnesty Return, together with the other documents stated in Sec. 6 (1) hereof, shall be filed as follows:a. Residents shall file with the Revenue District Officer (RDO)/Large Taxpayer District Office of the BIR which has jurisdiction over the legal residence or principal place of business of the taxpayer, as the case may be.b. Non-residents shall file with the office of the Commissioner of the BIR, or with the RDO.c. At the option of the taxpayer, the RDO may assist the taxpayer in accomplishing the forms and computing the taxable base and the amnesty tax payable, but may not look into, question or examine the veracity of the entries contained in the Tax Amnesty Return, [SALN], or such other documents submitted by the taxpayer.3. Payment of Amnesty Tax and Full Compliance. \u2014 Upon filing of the Tax Amnesty Return in accordance with Sec. 6 (2) hereof, the taxpayer shall pay the amnesty tax to the authorized agent bank or in the absence thereof, the Collection Agents or duly authorized Treasurer of the city or municipality in which such person has his legal residence or principal place of business.The RDO shall issue sufficient Acceptance of Payment Forms, as may be prescribed by the BIR for the use of \u2014 or to be accomplished by \u2014 the bank, the collection agent or the Treasurer, showing the acceptance by the amnesty tax payment. In case of the authorized agent bank, the branch manager or the assistant branch manager shall sign the acceptance of payment form.The Acceptance of Payment Form, the Notice of Availment, the SALN, and the Tax Amnesty Return shall be submitted to the RDO, which shall be received only after complete payment. The completion of these requirements shall be deemed full compliance with the provisions of [R.A. No.] 9480. x x x (Emphasis supplied)In this case, it remains undisputed that respondent complied with all the requirements pertaining to its application for tax amnesty by submitting to the BIR a Notice of Availment of Tax Amnesty, Tax Amnesty Return, SALN as of December 31, 2005 and Tax Amnesty Payment Form. Further, it paid the corresponding amnesty taxes. Hence, respondent has successfully availed itself of the tax amnesty benefits granted under R.A. No. 9480 which include immunity from \"the appurtenant civil, criminal, or administrative penalties under the NIRC of 1997, as amended, arising from the failure to pay any and all internal revenue taxes for taxable year 2005 and prior years.\"II.The CIR, however, insists that respondent is still liable for deficiency taxes, contending that under RMC No. 19-2008, respondent is disqualified to avail of the tax amnesty because it falls under the exception of \"delinquent accounts or accounts receivable considered as assets by the BIR or the Government, including self-assessed tax.\" In Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Philippine Aluminum Wheels, Inc.,[26] petitioner therein raised a similar argument which the Court did not sustain and instead ruled that \"in case there is a discrepancy between the law and a regulation issued to implement the law, the law prevails because the rule or regulation cannot go beyond the terms and provisions of the law. x x x To give effect to the exception under RMC No. 19-2008 of delinquent accounts or accounts receivable by the BIR, as interpreted by the BIR, would unlawfully create a new exception for availing of the Tax Amnesty Program under [R.A. No.] 9480.\"[27]Moreover, it must be noted that under Section 8 of R.A. No. 9480, only the following persons are disqualified from availing of the tax amnesty:SEC. 8. Exceptions. \u2014 x x x(a) Withholding agents with respect to their withholding tax liabilities;(b) Those with pending cases falling under the jurisdiction of the Presidential Commission on Good Government;(c) Those with pending cases involving unexplained or unlawfully acquired wealth or under the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act;(d) Those with pending cases filed in court involving violation of the Anti-Money Laundering Law;(e) Those with pending criminal cases for tax evasion and other criminal offenses under Chapter II of Title X of the National Internal Revenue Code of 1997, as amended, and the felonies of frauds, illegal exactions and transactions, and malversation of public funds and property under Chapters III and IV of Title VII of the Revised Penal Code; and(f) Tax cases subject of final and executory judgment by the courts.[28]It is a basic precept of statutory construction that the express mention of one person, thing, act, or consequence excludes all others as expressed in the maxim expressio unius est exclusio alterius. In implementing tax amnesty laws, the CIR cannot now insert an exception where there is none under the law. Indeed, a tax amnesty must be construed strictly against the taxpayer and liberally in favor of the taxing authority. However, the rule-making power of administrative agencies cannot be extended to amend or expand statutory requirements or to embrace matters not originally encompassed by the law. Administrative regulations should always be in accord with the provisions of the statute they seek to implement, and any resulting inconsistency shall be resolved in favor of the basic law.[29]III.As regards the issue on the propriety and timeliness of the petition for review, suffice it to say that in this case, the reckoning point of the 30-day period to appeal the assessments is immaterial because the assessments have already been extinguished by respondent's compliance with the requirements for tax amnesty under R.A. No. 9480. To sustain petitioner's contention that respondent should have elevated an appeal to the CTA when it received the Final Notice Before Seizure, or at most, when it received the July 10, 2008 Letter of the BIR, would lead to an absurd and unjust situation wherein the taxpayer avails of the benefits of a tax amnesty law, yet the BIR still issues a WDAL simply because the taxpayer did not appeal the assessment to the CTA. The requirement of filing an appeal with the CTA even after the taxpayer has already complied with the requirements of the tax amnesty law negates the amnesty granted to the taxpayer and creates a condition which is not found in the law. It is worthy to note that respondent filed a protest to the assessments, but because of the passage of R.A. No. 9480, it no longer pursued its legal remedies against the assessments. Thus, respondent cannot be faulted for filing a petition for review with the CTA only upon receipt of the WDAL for it rightfully relied on the provision of R.A. No. 9480 that \"those who availed themselves of the tax amnesty x x x, and have fully complied with all its conditions x x x shall be immune from the payment of taxes x x x.\" Finally, in CS Garment, Inc. v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue,[30] the Court pronounced that taxpayers may immediately enjoy the privileges and immunities under R.A. No. 9480 as soon as they fulfill the suspensive condition imposed therein, i.e., submission of 1) Notice of Availment of Tax Amnesty Form; 2) Tax Amnesty Return Form (BIR Form No. 2116); 3) SALN as of December 31, 2005; and 4) Tax Amnesty Payment Form (Acceptance of Payment Form or BIR Form No. 0617). In fine, the deficiency taxes for Fiscal Year July 1, 2001 to June 30, 2002 are deemed settled in view of respondent's compliance with the requirements for tax amnesty under R.A. No. 9480.WHEREFORE, the petition is DENIED.

[6] Without acting on respondent's protest, the BIR issued the First Collection Letter [7] dated August 3, 2007, demanding immediate payment of the assessments. Respondent received a copy of the First Collection Letter on August 28, 2007.\n\nThen, on January 17, 2008, petitioner constructively served a Final Notice Before Seizure [8] dated December 20, 2007, to respondent's office.\n\nOn February 29, 2008, respondent availed of the benefits of Republic Act (R.A.) No. 9480 by submitting the following documents to the Development Bank of the Philippines (DBP), an authorized agent bank of the BIR: 1) Notice of Availment of Tax Amnesty; 2) Tax Amnesty Return (BIR Form No. 2116); 3) Statement of Assets, Liabilities and Net Worth (SALN) as of December 31, 2005; and 4) Tax Amnesty Payment Form (BIR Form No. 0617). On the same day, respondent paid the BIR, through DBP, an amnesty tax in the amount of P112,500.00. On April 23, 2008, respondent paid P2,000.00 to the BIR in relation to FAN No. LTDO-122-PEN-2002-00002 for compromise penalties on alleged failure to file summary of sales and purchase from the first and second quarters of 2002.\n\nOn May 5, 2008, respondent informed the BIR Large Taxpayers District Office (LTDO) of Makati City in a letter dated April 28, 2008, that it availed of the benefits of R.A. No. 9480 and furnished the LTDO with copies of the tax amnesty documents. [9] The said letter was received by the BIR LTDO of Makati City on the same day.\n\nOn July 10, 2008, petitioner wrote respondent, advising the latter that under Revenue Memorandum Circular (RMC) No. 19-2008, those \"with delinquent accounts/accounts receivable considered as assets of the BIR/ Government, including self-assessed tax,\" are not allowed to avail of the benefits of R.A. No. 9480. [10]\n\nOn September 8, 2008, petitioner issued a Warrant of Distraint and/or Levy (WDAL) directing the seizure of respondent's goods, chattels or effects, and other personal properties, and/or levy of its real property and interest in/or rights to real property to the extent of P563,168,996.70. [11] A copy of the WDAL was constructively served on respondent's offices on September 11, 2008. On the same day, the Bank of the Philippine Islands (BPI) informed respondent that the latter's account was being put on hold because of the WDAL.\n\nThe CTA First Division Ruling\n\nIn an Amended Decision [12] dated February 28, 2012, the CTA First Division ruled that the CTA has jurisdiction not only over decisions or inactions of the CIR in cases involving disputed assessments, refunds of internal revenue taxes, fees or other charges, penalties in relation thereto, but also over other matters arising under the National Internal Revenue Code (NIRC) or other laws administered by the BIR. It declared that petitioner is already barred from collecting from respondent the alleged tax liabilities because it is undisputed that respondent had complied with all the legal requirements pertaining to its application for tax amnesty by submitting to the BIR its Notice of Availment of Tax Amnesty, Tax Amnesty Return, SALN, and Tax Amnesty Payment Form together with the BIR Tax Payment Deposit Slip evidencing payment of amnesty tax amounting to P112,500.00. The CTA First Division added that when respondent complied with all the requirements of R.A. No. 9480, it is deemed to have settled in full all its tax liabilities for the years covered by the tax amnesty. It held that the July 10, 2008 Letter of petitioner is void as it disqualifies respondent from availing of the immunity from payment of tax liabilities under R.A. No. 9480 on the ground that its account has been considered delinquent or receivable asset of the government, which reason is not in consonance with the provisions of R.A. No. 9480. The fallo reads:\n\nWHEREFORE, the Motion for Reconsideration (from the Decision dated 20 September 2011) dated October 11, 2011 filed by petitioner is hereby GRANTED.\n\nConsequently, the Warrant of Distraint and/or Levy dated September 08, 2008 is hereby declared NULL and VOID and of no legal effect. Respondent is now precluded from collecting the amount of P563,168,996.70, representing petitioner's tax liability for taxable year 2002, which is deemed settled.\n\nSO ORDERED. [13]\n\nPetitioner moved for reconsideration, but the same was denied by the CTA First Division in a Resolution [14] dated May 14, 2012. Aggrieved, petitioner filed a petition for review before the CTA En Banc.\n\nThe CTA En Banc Ruling\n\nIn a Decision [15] dated August 5, 2013, the CTA En Banc opined that it has jurisdiction to rule on the petition because it is not an appeal of the disputed assessment which is subject to a reglementary period, but it is a case to determine whether the issuance of the WDAL is proper. It added that the issue to be addressed is not the timeliness of the protest, but rather, whether petitioner may validly collect taxes from respondent despite the latter having availed of the tax amnesty. The CTA En Banc concluded that respondent properly availed of the immunity from payment of taxes under R.A. No. 9480, and as such, the issuance of a WDAL was invalid, which justified the filing of a petition within 30 days from receipt of the warrant. It disposed the case in this wise:\n\nWHEREFORE, the petition is DENIED. The Amended Decision dated February 28, 2012, rendered by the First Division of this Court in CTA Case No. 7842, and its Resolution dated May 14, 2012 are AFFIRMED. No pronouncement as to costs.\n\nSO ORDERED. [16]\n\nPetitioner moved for reconsideration, but the same was denied by the CTA En Banc on February 19, 2014. Hence, this petition for review on certiorari, wherein petitioner raises the following issues:\n\nWHETHER THE CTA COMMITTED REVERSIBLE ERROR WHEN IT ASSUMED JURISDICTION OVER THE CASE.\n\nWHETHER THE CTA COMMITTED REVERSIBLE ERROR WHEN IT RULED THAT RESPONDENT IS ENTITLED TO THE IMMUNITIES UNDER THE TAX AMNESTY PROGRAM PROVIDED IN REPUBLIC ACT NO. 9480. [17]\n\nPetitioner argues that Section 9 of R.A. No. 9282 provides that a party adversely affected by a decision, ruling or inaction of the CIR may file an appeal with the CTA within 30 days after the receipt of such decision or ruling; that the 30-day period for filing an appeal with the CTA should be reckoned from respondent's receipt of the Final Notice Before Seizure, or at the latest, its receipt of the Letter dated July 10, 2008; that it is erroneous to consider receipt of the WDAL as the date of reckoning the period to file an appeal to the CTA because the WDAL is merely a means, an instrument, or a mechanism to implement the Final Notice Before Seizure, or at the latest, the July 10, 2008 Letter; that whatever decision, action, or ruling petitioner had with respect to respondent's claims and/or defenses was set forth in the aforementioned issuances and not in the WDAL; and that in providing for the exception that delinquent accounts, or accounts receivable considered assets of the government are not eligible under the tax amnesty program, RMC No. 19-2008 merely supplied the gap in the law where assessments have become final and incontestable upon the lapse of the reglementary period for appeal. [18]\n\nIn its Comment, [19] respondent counters that the CTA is vested with jurisdiction to determine whether a taxpayer is immune from the payment of taxes insofar as it is given the exclusive appellate jurisdiction to review by appeal matters arising from the laws administered by the BIR such as tax amnesty statutes; that in Pantoja v. David, [20] the Court ruled that petitions for the annulment of distraint orders of the BIR do not violate the prohibition against injunctions to restrain the collection of taxes because the proceedings were not directed against the right of the BIR to collect per se, but against the right of the BIR to do so by distraint and levy; that while it did not file any petition for review from its receipt of the Final Notice Before Seizure, or the July 10, 2008 Letter, it availed of the tax amnesty on February 29, 2008 by complying with the requirements of R.A. No. 9480; that in CS Garment, Inc. v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, [21] the Court ruled that a taxpayer immediately enjoys the immunities granted by R.A. No. 9480 as soon as the taxpayer complies with the conditions under the law and the BIR may not prevent or delay a taxpayer from immediately enjoying immunity from the payment of taxes by making the tax amnesty application contingent on the BIR's confirmation or agreement; that in Union Bank of the Philippines v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, [22] decided by the CTA, the latter held that Section 4 of R.A. No. 9480 limits petitioner's remedy to assailing the taxpayer's SALN within a period of one year from the date of filing; that after the one-year period mandated by R.A. No. 9480, the tax amnesty could no longer be disputed by the BIR; and that to allow petitioner to enforce collection of assessments covered by the amnesty availed by respondent through the perfunctory and summary issuance of a WDAL would sanction a disregard of the law, and to punish respondent for its compliance therewith.\n\nIn its Reply, [23] petitioner contends that the July 10, 2008 Letter was the adverse decision or ruling appealable to the CTA and respondent's receipt of the letter is the proper reckoning point for filing a petition for review with the CTA; that respondent received the said letter on August 5, 2008, thus, it was already apprised of petitioner's adverse decision regarding its application for tax amnesty at that time; that respondent had until September 4, 2008 to appeal the decision, however, respondent's petition for review was filed with the CTA only on October 10, 2008; and that assessments which have become final and executory upon the taxpayer's failure to appeal therefrom are outside the coverage of R.A. No. 9480.\n\nThe Court's Ruling\n\nI.\n\nA tax amnesty operates as a general pardon or intentional overlooking by the State of its authority to impose penalties on persons otherwise guilty of evasion or violation of a revenue or tax law. It is an absolute forgiveness or waiver by the government of its right to collect what is due it and to give tax evaders who wish to relent a chance to start with a clean slate. A tax amnesty, much like a tax exemption, is never favored nor presumed in law. The grant of a tax amnesty is akin to a tax exemption; thus, it must be construed strictly against the taxpayer and liberally in favor of the taxing authority. [24]\n\nOn May 24, 2007, R.A. No. 9480 took effect and authorized the grant of a tax amnesty to qualified taxpayers for all national internal revenue taxes for the taxable year 2005 and prior years, with or without assessments duly issued therefor, that have remained unpaid as of December 31, 2005. [25] The pertinent provisions of R.A. No. 9480 are:\n\nSEC. 1. Coverage. \u2014 There is hereby authorized and granted a tax amnesty which shall cover all national internal revenue taxes for the taxable year 2005 and prior years, with or without assessments duly issued therefor, That have remained unpaid as of December 31, 2005: Provided, however, that the amnesty hereby authorized and granted shall not cover persons or cases enumerated under Section 8 hereof.\n\nx x x x\n\nSEC. 6. Immunities and Privileges. \u2014 Those who availed themselves of the tax amnesty under Section 5 hereof, and have fully complied with all its conditions shall be entitled to the following immunities and privileges:\n\n(a) The taxpayer shall be immune from the payment of taxes, as well as additions thereto, and the appurtenant civil, criminal or administrative penalties under the National Internal Revenue Code of 1997, as amended, arising from the failure to pay any and all internal revenue taxes for taxable year 2005 and prior years. (Emphases supplied)\n\nx x x x\n\nTo implement R.A. No. 9480, the Department of Finance (DOF) issued DOF Department Order No. 29-07 (DO 29-07). Section 6 thereof outlines the method for availing a tax amnesty under R.A. No. 9480, viz.:\n\nSEC. 6. Method of Availment of Tax Amnesty.\n\n1. Forms/Documents to be filed. \u2014 To avail of the general tax amnesty, concerned taxpayers shall file the following documents/requirements:\na. Notice of Availment in such form as may be prescribed by the BIR;\n\nb. Statement of Assets, Liabilities and Networth (SALN) as of December 31, 2005 in such [form], as may be prescribed by the BIR;\n\nc. Tax Amnesty Return in such form as may be prescribed by the BIR.\n\n2. Place of Filing of Amnesty Tax Return. \u2014 The Tax Amnesty Return, together with the other documents stated in Sec. 6 (1) hereof, shall be filed as follows:\na. Residents shall file with the Revenue District Officer (RDO)/Large Taxpayer District Office of the BIR which has jurisdiction over the legal residence or principal place of business of the taxpayer, as the case may be.\n\nb. Non-residents shall file with the office of the Commissioner of the BIR, or with the RDO.\n\nc. At the option of the taxpayer, the RDO may assist the taxpayer in accomplishing the forms and computing the taxable base and the amnesty tax payable, but may not look into, question or examine the veracity of the entries contained in the Tax Amnesty Return, [SALN], or such other documents submitted by the taxpayer.\n\n3. Payment of Amnesty Tax and Full Compliance. \u2014 Upon filing of the Tax Amnesty Return in accordance with Sec. 6 (2) hereof, the taxpayer shall pay the amnesty tax to the authorized agent bank or in the absence thereof, the Collection Agents or duly authorized Treasurer of the city or municipality in which such person has his legal residence or principal place of business.\n\nThe RDO shall issue sufficient Acceptance of Payment Forms, as may be prescribed by the BIR for the use of \u2014 or to be accomplished by \u2014 the bank, the collection agent or the Treasurer, showing the acceptance by the amnesty tax payment. In case of the authorized agent bank, the branch manager or the assistant branch manager shall sign the acceptance of payment form.\n\nThe Acceptance of Payment Form, the Notice of Availment, the SALN, and the Tax Amnesty Return shall be submitted to the RDO, which shall be received only after complete payment. The completion of these requirements shall be deemed full compliance with the provisions of [R.A. No.] 9480. x x x (Emphasis supplied)\n\nIn this case, it remains undisputed that respondent complied with all the requirements pertaining to its application for tax amnesty by submitting to the BIR a Notice of Availment of Tax Amnesty, Tax Amnesty Return, SALN as of December 31, 2005 and Tax Amnesty Payment Form. Further, it paid the corresponding amnesty taxes. Hence, respondent has successfully availed itself of the tax amnesty benefits granted under R.A. No. 9480 which include immunity from \"the appurtenant civil, criminal, or administrative penalties under the NIRC of 1997, as amended, arising from the failure to pay any and all internal revenue taxes for taxable year 2005 and prior years.\"\n\nII.\n\nThe CIR, however, insists that respondent is still liable for deficiency taxes, contending that under RMC No. 19-2008, respondent is disqualified to avail of the tax amnesty because it falls under the exception of \"delinquent accounts or accounts receivable considered as assets by the BIR or the Government, including self-assessed tax.\" In Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Philippine Aluminum Wheels, Inc., [26] petitioner therein raised a similar argument which the Court did not sustain and instead ruled that \"in case there is a discrepancy between the law and a regulation issued to implement the law, the law prevails because the rule or regulation cannot go beyond the terms and provisions of the law. x x x To give effect to the exception under RMC No. 19-2008 of delinquent accounts or accounts receivable by the BIR, as interpreted by the BIR, would unlawfully create a new exception for availing of the Tax Amnesty Program under [R.A. No.] 9480.\" [27]\n\nMoreover, it must be noted that under Section 8 of R.A. No. 9480, only the following persons are disqualified from availing of the tax amnesty:\n\nSEC. 8. Exceptions. \u2014 x x x\n\n(a) Withholding agents with respect to their withholding tax liabilities;\n\n(b) Those with pending cases falling under the jurisdiction of the Presidential Commission on Good Government;\n\n(c) Those with pending cases involving unexplained or unlawfully acquired wealth or under the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act;\n\n(d) Those with pending cases filed in court involving violation of the Anti-Money Laundering Law;\n\n(e) Those with pending criminal cases for tax evasion and other criminal offenses under Chapter II of Title X of the National Internal Revenue Code of 1997, as amended, and the felonies of frauds, illegal exactions and transactions, and malversation of public funds and property under Chapters III and IV of Title VII of the Revised Penal Code; and\n\n(f) Tax cases subject of final and executory judgment by the courts. [28]\n\nIt is a basic precept of statutory construction that the express mention of one person, thing, act, or consequence excludes all others as expressed in the maxim expressio unius est exclusio alterius. In implementing tax amnesty laws, the CIR cannot now insert an exception where there is none under the law. Indeed, a tax amnesty must be construed strictly against the taxpayer and liberally in favor of the taxing authority. However, the rule-making power of administrative agencies cannot be extended to amend or expand statutory requirements or to embrace matters not originally encompassed by the law. Administrative regulations should always be in accord with the provisions of the statute they seek to implement, and any resulting inconsistency shall be resolved in favor of the basic law. [29]\n\nIII.\n\nAs regards the issue on the propriety and timeliness of the petition for review, suffice it to say that in this case, the reckoning point of the 30-day period to appeal the assessments is immaterial because the assessments have already been extinguished by respondent's compliance with the requirements for tax amnesty under R.A. No. 9480. To sustain petitioner's contention that respondent should have elevated an appeal to the CTA when it received the Final Notice Before Seizure, or at most, when it received the July 10, 2008 Letter of the BIR, would lead to an absurd and unjust situation wherein the taxpayer avails of the benefits of a tax amnesty law, yet the BIR still issues a WDAL simply because the taxpayer did not appeal the assessment to the CTA. The requirement of filing an appeal with the CTA even after the taxpayer has already complied with the requirements of the tax amnesty law negates the amnesty granted to the taxpayer and creates a condition which is not found in the law. It is worthy to note that respondent filed a protest to the assessments, but because of the passage of R.A. No. 9480, it no longer pursued its legal remedies against the assessments. Thus, respondent cannot be faulted for filing a petition for review with the CTA only upon receipt of the WDAL for it rightfully relied on the provision of R.A. No. 9480 that \"those who availed themselves of the tax amnesty x x x, and have fully complied with all its conditions x x x shall be immune from the payment of taxes x x x.\" Finally, in CS Garment, Inc. v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, [30] the Court pronounced that taxpayers may immediately enjoy the privileges and immunities under R.A. No. 9480 as soon as they fulfill the suspensive condition imposed therein, i.e., submission of 1) Notice of Availment of Tax Amnesty Form; 2) Tax Amnesty Return Form (BIR Form No. 2116); 3) SALN as of December 31, 2005; and 4) Tax Amnesty Payment Form (Acceptance of Payment Form or BIR Form No. 0617). In fine, the deficiency taxes for Fiscal Year July 1, 2001 to June 30, 2002 are deemed settled in view of respondent's compliance with the requirements for tax amnesty under R.A. No. 9480.\n\nWHEREFORE, the petition is DENIED. The August 5, 2013 Decision and the February 19, 2014 Resolution of the Court of Tax Appeals in CTA EB Case No. 907 are AFFIRMED.\n\nSO ORDERED.\n\nCarpio, (Chairperson), Perlas-Bernabe, Caguioa, and Hernando, * JJ., concur.\n\n* Additional Member per S.O.

KIMURA AND YUICHIRO KIMURA, PETITIONERS.D E C I S I O N BERSAMIN, C.J.: The petitioners implore us to determine whether or not the illegitimate child of the spouse of an adopting alien falls within the ambit of the clause \"relative by consanguinity or affinity within the fourth civil degree\" contained in Section 7 (b)(i) and (iii), Article III, of Republic Act No. 8552, otherwise known as the Domestic Adoption Act of 1998, which pertinently provides:SEC. 7. Who May Adopt. - The following may adopt:x x x x(b) Any alien possessing the same qualifications as above stated for Filipino nationals: Provided, That his/her country has diplomatic relations with the Republic of the Philippines, that he/she has been living in the Philippines for at least three (3) continuous years prior to the filing of the application for adoption and maintains such residence until the adoption decree is entered, that he/she has been certified by his/her diplomatic or consular office or any appropriate government agency that he/she has the legal capacity to adopt in his/her country, and that his/her government allows the adoptee to enter his/her country as his/her adopted son/daughter: Provided, further, That the requirements on residency and certification of the alien's qualification to adopt in his/her country may be waived for the following:(i) a former Filipino citizen who seeks to adopt a relative within the fourth (4th) degree of consanguinity or affinity; or(ii) one who seeks to adopt the legitimate son/daughter of his/her Filipino spouse; or(iii) one who is married to a Filipino citizen and seeks to adopt jointly with his/her spouse a relative within the fourth (4th) degree of consanguinity or affinity of the Filipino spouses; x x x. (Bold underscoring supplied for emphasis)The CaseThis appeal seeks to reverse and undo the judgment and order by the Regional Trial Court (RTC), Branch 33, in Davao City on February 14, 2012[1] and January 22, 2013,[2] respectively, dismissing their petition for the adoption of the minor Jan Aurel Maghanoy Bulayo (Jan Aurel) in SP. Proc. No. 10, 718-2010, and denying their motion for reconsideration.AntecedentsThe antecedent facts are as follows:Spouses Mary Jane B. Kimura, a Filipino national, and Yuichiro Kimura, a Japanese national, got married on June 12, 2004.Prior thereto, petitioner Mary Jane gave birth to her son Jan Aurel on November 24, 1997. However, she was not married to her son's biological father, Jun Baldoza, thus making Jan Aurel her illegitimate child. Her last communication with the minor's father was when she was four (4) months pregnant with [Jan Aurel]. From then on, she has no knowledge of his whereabouts.On March 15, 2009, petitioners filed a joint petition for adoption of Jan Aurel seeking, among others, to have him declared as their legitimate son, enjoying the rights and observing the duties of an adopted child as provided by law.During trial, petitioners presented the Department of Social Welfare and Development Minor's Case Study and Home Study Report which recommended approval of said petition.Likewise, petitioners presented the following documents to show that they are in possession of full civil capacity and legal rights to adopt, of good moral character, have not been convicted of any crime involving moral turpitude, and emotionally and psychologically capable of caring for children, x x x.[3]Specifically, the petitioners presented the following documents to support their petition for adoption, namely; (1) the marriage contract of the petitioners; (2) the permanent registration in Japan of petitioner Yuichiro Kimura (Yuichiro); (3) the medical certificates issued to the petitioners; (4) the neuro-psychological reports for the petitioners; (5) the certificates of attendance in adoption orientation conducted by Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD); (6) the NBI clearances issued to the petitioners; (7) the police clearances of the petitioners; (8) the Prosecutor's clearances issued to the petitioners; (9) the court clearances of the petitioners; (10) the income tax return of Yuichiro; (11) the certificate of employment Yuichiro.Nonetheless, on February 14, 2012, the RTC denied the petition for adoption because Yuichiro, being a Japanese citizen, did not comply with the requirements laid down under Section 7 of R.A. No. 8552 and Section 7 of Administrative Matter No. 02-6-02-SC.[4] The RTC observed that Yuichiro was not exempt from the residency and certification requirements under Section 7(b) of R.A. No. 8552 because Jan Aurel was the illegitimate child of co-petitioner Mary Jane Kimura (Mary Jane).[5]Hence, this direct appeal by petition for review on certiorari.IssuesThe petitioners hereby raise the following questions of law, to wit:(1) Whether or not an illegitimate child is within the fourth degree of consanguinity or affinity in the contemplation of Section 7(b)(iii) of R.A. No. 8552;(2) Whether or not an illegitimate child is contemplated in Section 7(b)(ii) of R.A. No. 8552; and,(3) Whether or not the existence of diplomatic relations between the Philippines and Japan is within judicial notice of the courts.[6]Decisive is the correct interpretation of Section 7(b)(i) and (iii) of R.A. No. 8552, particularly the clause \"a relative within the fourth degree of consanguinity or affinity\"?Ruling of the CourtThe appeal has merit.I. Section 7(b)(i) and (iii) of R.A. 8552 should extend and apply even to illegitimate childrenIn contending that the RTC should have granted their petition for adoption, the petitioners emphasize that they are exempt from the requirements for the reason that Jan Aurel was a relative by consanguinity within the fourth civil degree of Mary Jane. They insist that Section 7 necessarily includes all relatives \u2013 whether legitimate or illegitimate \u2013 within the fourth degree of consanguinity or affinity; that an illegitimate child is a relative within the first degree of consanguinity of the biological mother or father; that excluding an illegitimate child from the contemplation of Section 7(b)(i) and (iii) of R.A. No. 8552 is tantamount to saying that it is easier for an alien spouse to jointly adopt with the Filipino spouse the latter's cousin, a relative within the fourth degree, or the nephew or niece, a relative. within the third degree of consanguinity or affinity,[7] than the Filipino spouse's own biological child.The petitioners' insistence is upheld.A relative is either a \"kinsman\" or \"a person connected with another by blood or affinity.\"[8] Under the Civil Code, the degree of relationship is determined as follows:RelationshipARTICLE 963. Proximity of relationship is determined by the number of generations. Each generation forms a degree.ARTICLE 964. A series of degrees forms a line, which may be either direct or collateral.A direct line is that constituted by the series of degrees among ascendants and descendants.x x x xARTICLE 965. The direct line is either descending or ascending. x x x xARTICLE 966. In the line, as many degrees are counted as there are generations or persons, excluding the progenitor.In the direct line, ascent is made to the common ancestor. Thus, the child is one degree removed from the parent, two from the grandfather, and three from the great-grandparent.Pursuant to the foregoing, an illegitimate child is a relative within the first civil degree of consanguinity of his biological mother. Unlike a nephew and niece, an illegitimate child belongs to the direct maternal lineage, which is never uncertain,[9] and which is not as remote as the nephew and niece. The word \"child\" referred to in Article 966 of the Civil Code is used in a general term and is without qualification. This is so because the provision contemplates blood relation, not status. When the provision does not distinguish between legitimate and illegitimate relatives, we, too, must not. Let us adhere to the Latin maxim that declares: ubi lex non distinguit, nec nos distinguera debemus (where the law does not distinguish, nor the interpreter must distinguish).To put more clarity on the legislative intent, we refer to the deliberations on Senate Bill No. 1523 (now, R.A. No. 8552) in identifying who can adopt and who may be adopted under Section 7(b), Article III, of R.A. No. 8552, to wit:The President. x x xIn respect to former Filipino citizen referred to in line 2 of page 6-- meaning the exception where aliens may adopt-- why are relatives here limited to those by consanguinity and it does not include those who are so by affinity?Senator Santiago. This is a reflection of a native cultural bias, or prejudice in favor of blood relations. This is a peculiarly Asian world view.The President. So, the committee has no intention of expanding this to include relatives by affinity.Senator Santiago. If there are reasonable grounds for advancing an argument, the committee would be happy to consider it.The President. Up to what degree of relatives by consanguinity or affinity, up to what degree?Senator Santiago. Generally, in trial courts, this phrase is construed in an open-ended way. As long as there is a tie of consanguinity, no matter how remote, then it falls under the coverage of this exception.The President. Is that the clear intention of this provision?Senator Santiago. Yes, Mr. President. x x x x Senator Maceda. x x xNow, I support the stand of the Senate President on the question of consanguinity or affinity, especially if this former Filipino citizen is probably going to leave again. If the idea is, as stated, to try to encourage more adoptions, especially for those who have some relations, the matter of allowing relatives by consanguinity or affinity within the fourth degree, in my opinion, should be allowed.So if the Senate President will propose that amendment, I shall certainly support it.Now, still on page 6 (b) and (c), I see the difference here. It says: \"(b) One who seeks to adopt the legitimate child OR CHILDREN of his or her Filipino spouse; [or]\"(c) One who is married to a Filipino citizen and seeks to adopt jointly with his or her spouse a relative by consanguinity of the latter.\"This is basically the same except, probably, the difference is the joint adoption. Would that be correct?Senator Santiago. Under paragraph (b), the subject is only the legitimate child. But under paragraph (c), the subject is a bigger group, because it covers relatives by consanguinity who do not necessarily have to be children.Senator Maceda. Exactly, Mr. President. On the other hand, a legitimate child is also within the ambit of relative by consanguinity. Is that not correct?Senator Santiago. That is correct, Mr. President.x x x x[10] (Emphasis supplied)GONZALES AMENDMENTSMay the Chair offer this amendment? In line 3, delete the semicolon (;) and add the following phrase: OR, AFFINITY WITHIN THE FOURTH CIVIL DEGREE.Senator Santiago. May I please just clarify? It would now read: \"...who seeks to adopt a relative by consanguinity OR AFFINITY WITHIN THE FOURTH CIVIL DEGREE.\" So the limitation on civil degree will apply to both consanguinity and affinity?The President. That is correct. That is the intention of the amendment.Senator Santiago. I am delighted to accept the amendment, Mr. President.The President. Is there any objection? [Silence] There being none, the amendment is approved.[11]Although Senate Bill No. 1523 originally indicated that the exception should only cover relatives by consanguinity, the lawmakers were in agreement during the period of individual amendments to include the phrase \"or affinity within the fourth civil degree\" in order to expand the coverage to more children or relatives under the preferential exception embodied in Section 7. The reason was stated in Section 2 of the law, which declares that it is the State's policy \"to ensure that every child remains under the care and custody of his/her parent(s) and be provided with love, care, understanding and security towards the full and harmonious development of his/her personality.\"R.A. No. 8552 undoubtedly intended to include Jan Aurel, the biological child of Mary Jane, in the term \"relatives\" under Section 7(b)(iii) because he was her relative within the first civil degree. Finding otherwise would engender a situation where the alien adopter would be able to undergo a speedy and less expensive adoption process by being able to adopt, say, his Filipina spouse's nephew or niece instead of the Filipino spouse's own child.It is relevant to note that the Office of the Solicitor General (OSG) joins the petitioners' position, and emphasizes that \"if the law exempts the alien adopter from residency and certification requirements if he/she will adopt the brother/sister, nephew/niece or cousin of his/her Filipino spouse (who are within the 4th civil degree of consanguinity or affinity), then there is no reason to exclude the application of the said exemption if the adoptee is the illegitimate child of the said Filipino spouse.\"[12]At any rate, had the legislators intended that only the legitimate children were contemplated by Section 7(b)(i) and (iii), then Congress should have been written the law as explicitly. Indeed, Congress did so in Section 7(b)(ii)[13] by including the term \"legitimate\" to describe the children contemplated by that clause. Section 7(b)(i) and (iii) clearly covered both legitimate and illegitimate relatives as long as they were within the fourth civil degree of consanguinity or affinity.II Courts may take judicial notice of the existence of diplomatic relationsbetween the Philippines and JapanThe petitioners assert that their petition for adoption has indicated the existence of the diplomatic relations between Philippines and Japan, but they did not anymore prove the same during the trial because the existence of such diplomatic relations was within the judicial notice of the courts.[14]The OSG has not refuted the petitioners' assertion.Section 1 and Section 2, Rule 129 of the Rules of Court state:Section 1. Judicial notice, when mandatory. \u2014 A court shall take judicial notice, without the introduction of evidence, of the existence and territorial extent of states, their political history, forms of government and symbols of nationality, the law of nations, the admiralty and maritime courts of the world and their seals, the political constitution and history of the Philippines, the official acts of legislative, executive and judicial departments of the Philippines, the laws of nature, the measure of time, and the geographical divisions. (1a)Section 2. Judicial notice, when discretionary. \u2014 A court may take judicial notice of matters which are of public knowledge, or are capable to unquestionable demonstration, or ought to be known to judges because of their judicial functions.The courts of the Philippines are bound to take judicial notice of the existence of the diplomatic relations between our country and Japan pursuant to both Section 1 and Section 2, supra. Diplomatic relations form part of the official acts of the Executive Department of our Government. They are also matters of public knowledge.There is no dispute, indeed, that the Philippines and Japan have had a long history of diplomatic relations.[15] In 1888, Japan already established a diplomatic office in Manila, and expanded it as a Consulate General in 1919. Eventually, Japan declared its office in Manila an embassy in 1943 during the Japanese occupation of the country. Both countries were also signatories to the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations, an indication that they wished to have a more prominent diplomatic presence in each other by sending of diplomatic missions. This further shows that both countries, being signatories to the Vienna Convention, aimed to have the representation of the interests of the sending state and promoting friendly relations with the receiving state.[16] The countless efforts to maintain their diplomatic relations no longer required the presentation of proof of the existence of diplomatic relations.WHEREFORE, the Court GRANTS the petition for review on certiorari; REVERSES and SETS ASIDE the judgment and order rendered, respectively, on February 14, 2012 and January 22, 2013 by the Regional Trial Court, Branch 33, in Davao City in SP.

No. 205752, October 01, 2019 ]\n\nIN RE: PETITION FOR ADOPTION OF JAN AUREL MAGHANOY BULAYO WITH APPLICATION FOR CHANGE OF NAME OF ADOPTEE FROM \"JAN AUREL MAGHANOY BULAYO\" TO \"JAN AUREL BULAYO KIMURA,\" SPOUSES MARY JANE B. KIMURA AND YUICHIRO KIMURA, PETITIONERS.D E C I S I O N\nIN RE: PETITION FOR ADOPTION OF JAN AUREL MAGHANOY BULAYO WITH APPLICATION FOR CHANGE OF NAME OF ADOPTEE FROM \"JAN AUREL MAGHANOY BULAYO\" TO \"JAN AUREL BULAYO KIMURA,\"\n\nSPOUSES MARY JANE B. KIMURA AND YUICHIRO KIMURA, PETITIONERS.\n\nD E C I S I O N\n\nBERSAMIN, C.J.:\n\nThe petitioners implore us to determine whether or not the illegitimate child of the spouse of an adopting alien falls within the ambit of the clause \"relative by consanguinity or affinity within the fourth civil degree\" contained in Section 7 (b)(i) and (iii), Article III, of Republic Act No. 8552, otherwise known as the Domestic Adoption Act of 1998 , which pertinently provides:\n\nSEC. 7. Who May Adopt. - The following may adopt:\n\nx x x x\n\n(b) Any alien possessing the same qualifications as above stated for Filipino nationals: Provided, That his/her country has diplomatic relations with the Republic of the Philippines, that he/she has been living in the Philippines for at least three (3) continuous years prior to the filing of the application for adoption and maintains such residence until the adoption decree is entered, that he/she has been certified by his/her diplomatic or consular office or any appropriate government agency that he/she has the legal capacity to adopt in his/her country, and that his/her government allows the adoptee to enter his/her country as his/her adopted son/daughter: Provided, further, That the requirements on residency and certification of the alien's qualification to adopt in his/her country may be waived for the following:\n\n(i) a former Filipino citizen who seeks to adopt a relative within the fourth (4th) degree of consanguinity or affinity ; or\n\n(ii) one who seeks to adopt the legitimate son/daughter of his/her Filipino spouse; or\n\n(iii) one who is married to a Filipino citizen and seeks to adopt jointly with his/her spouse a relative within the fourth (4th) degree of consanguinity or affinity of the Filipino spouses; x x x. (Bold underscoring supplied for emphasis)\n\nThe Case\n\nThis appeal seeks to reverse and undo the judgment and order by the Regional Trial Court (RTC), Branch 33, in Davao City on February 14, 2012 [1] and January 22, 2013, [2] respectively, dismissing their petition for the adoption of the minor Jan Aurel Maghanoy Bulayo (Jan Aurel) in SP. Proc. No. 10, 718-2010, and denying their motion for reconsideration.\n\nAntecedents\n\nThe antecedent facts are as follows:\n\nSpouses Mary Jane B. Kimura, a Filipino national, and Yuichiro Kimura, a Japanese national, got married on June 12, 2004.\n\nPrior thereto, petitioner Mary Jane gave birth to her son Jan Aurel on November 24, 1997. However, she was not married to her son's biological father, Jun Baldoza, thus making Jan Aurel her illegitimate child. Her last communication with the minor's father was when she was four (4) months pregnant with [Jan Aurel]. From then on, she has no knowledge of his whereabouts.\n\nOn March 15, 2009, petitioners filed a joint petition for adoption of Jan Aurel seeking, among others, to have him declared as their legitimate son, enjoying the rights and observing the duties of an adopted child as provided by law.\n\nDuring trial, petitioners presented the Department of Social Welfare and Development Minor's Case Study and Home Study Report which recommended approval of said petition.\n\nLikewise, petitioners presented the following documents to show that they are in possession of full civil capacity and legal rights to adopt, of good moral character, have not been convicted of any crime involving moral turpitude, and emotionally and psychologically capable of caring for children, x x x. [3]\n\nSpecifically, the petitioners presented the following documents to support their petition for adoption, namely; (1) the marriage contract of the petitioners; (2) the permanent registration in Japan of petitioner Yuichiro Kimura (Yuichiro); (3) the medical certificates issued to the petitioners; (4) the neuro-psychological reports for the petitioners; (5) the certificates of attendance in adoption orientation conducted by Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD); (6) the NBI clearances issued to the petitioners; (7) the police clearances of the petitioners; (8) the Prosecutor's clearances issued to the petitioners; (9) the court clearances of the petitioners; (10) the income tax return of Yuichiro; (11) the certificate of employment Yuichiro.\n\nNonetheless, on February 14, 2012, the RTC denied the petition for adoption because Yuichiro, being a Japanese citizen, did not comply with the requirements laid down under Section 7 of R.A. No. 8552 and Section 7 of Administrative Matter No. 02-6-02-SC. [4] The RTC observed that Yuichiro was not exempt from the residency and certification requirements under Section 7(b) of R.A. No. 8552 because Jan Aurel was the illegitimate child of co-petitioner Mary Jane Kimura (Mary Jane). [5]\n\nHence, this direct appeal by petition for review on certiorari .\n\nIssues\n\nThe petitioners hereby raise the following questions of law, to wit:\n\n(1) Whether or not an illegitimate child is within the fourth degree of consanguinity or affinity in the contemplation of Section 7(b)(iii) of R.A. No. 8552;\n\n(2) Whether or not an illegitimate child is contemplated in Section 7(b)(ii) of R.A. No. 8552; and,\n\n(3) Whether or not the existence of diplomatic relations between the Philippines and Japan is within judicial notice of the courts. [6]\n\nDecisive is the correct interpretation of Section 7(b)(i) and (iii) of R.A. No. 8552, particularly the clause \"a relative within the fourth degree of consanguinity or affinity\" ?\n\nRuling of the Court\n\nThe appeal has merit.\n\nI.\nSection 7(b)(i) and (iii) of R.A. 8552 should\nextend and apply even to illegitimate children\n\nIn contending that the RTC should have granted their petition for adoption, the petitioners emphasize that they are exempt from the requirements for the reason that Jan Aurel was a relative by consanguinity within the fourth civil degree of Mary Jane. They insist that Section 7 necessarily includes all relatives \u2013 whether legitimate or illegitimate \u2013 within the fourth degree of consanguinity or affinity; that an illegitimate child is a relative within the first degree of consanguinity of the biological mother or father; that excluding an illegitimate child from the contemplation of Section 7(b)(i) and (iii) of R.A. No. 8552 is tantamount to saying that it is easier for an alien spouse to jointly adopt with the Filipino spouse the latter's cousin, a relative within the fourth degree, or the nephew or niece, a relative. within the third degree of consanguinity or affinity, [7] than the Filipino spouse's own biological child.\n\nThe petitioners' insistence is upheld.\n\nA relative is either a \"kinsman\" or \"a person connected with another by blood or affinity.\" [8] Under the Civil Code , the degree of relationship is determined as follows:\n\nRelationship\n\nARTICLE 963. Proximity of relationship is determined by the number of generations. Each generation forms a degree.\n\nARTICLE 964. A series of degrees forms a line, which may be either direct or collateral.\n\nA direct line is that constituted by the series of degrees among ascendants and descendants.\n\nx x x x\n\nARTICLE 965. The direct line is either descending or ascending.\n\nx x x x\n\nARTICLE 966. In the line, as many degrees are counted as there are generations or persons, excluding the progenitor.\n\nIn the direct line, ascent is made to the common ancestor. Thus, the child is one degree removed from the parent, two from the grandfather, and three from the great-grandparent.\n\nPursuant to the foregoing, an illegitimate child is a relative within the first civil degree of consanguinity of his biological mother. Unlike a nephew and niece, an illegitimate child belongs to the direct maternal lineage, which is never uncertain, [9] and which is not as remote as the nephew and niece. The word \"child\" referred to in Article 966 of the Civil Code is used in a general term and is without qualification. This is so because the provision contemplates blood relation, not status. When the provision does not distinguish between legitimate and illegitimate relatives, we, too, must not. Let us adhere to the Latin maxim that declares: ubi lex non distinguit, nec nos distinguera debemus (where the law does not distinguish, nor the interpreter must distinguish).\n\nTo put more clarity on the legislative intent, we refer to the deliberations on Senate Bill No. 1523 (now, R.A. No. 8552) in identifying who can adopt and who may be adopted under Section 7(b), Article III, of R.A. No. 8552, to wit:\n\nThe President. x x x\n\nIn respect to former Filipino citizen referred to in line 2 of page 6-- meaning the exception where aliens may adopt-- why are relatives here limited to those by consanguinity and it does not include those who are so by affinity?\n\nSenator Santiago. This is a reflection of a native cultural bias, or prejudice in favor of blood relations. This is a peculiarly Asian world view.\n\nThe President. So, the committee has no intention of expanding this to include relatives by affinity.\n\nSenator Santiago. If there are reasonable grounds for advancing an argument, the committee would be happy to consider it.\n\nThe President. Up to what degree of relatives by consanguinity or affinity, up to what degree?\n\nSenator Santiago. Generally, in trial courts, this phrase is construed in an open-ended way. As long as there is a tie of consanguinity, no matter how remote, then it falls under the coverage of this exception.\n\nThe President.

Yes, Mr. President.\n\nx x x x\n\nSenator Maceda. x x x\n\nNow, I support the stand of the Senate President on the question of consanguinity or affinity, especially if this former Filipino citizen is probably going to leave again.

R E S O L U T I O N CARANDANG, J.: For resolution is the Motion for Reconsideration[1] filed by respondent Panay Electric Company, Inc. (PECO) of the Court's Decision[2] dated September 15, 2020 of this Court, the dispositive portion of which reads: WHEREFORE, the instant Petitions are GRANTED. The assailed Judgment dated July 1, 2019 is REVERSED and SET ASIDE. Section 10 and 17 of Republic Act No. 11212 are DECLARED CONSTITUTIONAL. SO ORDERED.[3] (Emphasis in the original) Antecedents On July 23, 2018, Republic Act (R.A.) No. 11212[4] was enacted granting petitioner More Electric and Power Corporation (MORE) a franchise to establish, operate, and maintain an electric power distribution system in Iloilo City. Section 10 of R.A. No. 11212[5] confers on MORE the authority to exercise the right of eminent domain. The distribution system, which is presently being used in Iloilo City, comprises of \"five 5 sub-transmission line substations, 450 kilometers of electrical lines, 20,000 poles, 1,300 transformers and 64,000 electrical meters\"[6] owned by PECO, a holder of the franchise since 1922.[7] The franchise of PECO expired on January 18, 2019 and no new franchise had been issued in its favor. Nonetheless, since MORE has not established its service yet, Section 17 of R.A. No. 11212 permits PECO to continue operating the existing distribution system during the interim period.[8] Accordingly, through a Provisional Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity (CPCN) that the Energy Regulatory Commission (ERC) on May 21, 2019 issued, PECO continues to operate its existing distribution system.[9] The same provision also states that even if PECO is operating the distribution system, the interim arrangement shall not prevent MORE from acquiring the system through the exercise of the right of eminent domain. Incidentally, on March 6, 2019, PECO filed a Petition for Declaratory Relief[10] docketed as Civil Case No. R-MND-19-00571 assailing the constitutionality of Sections 10 and 17 of R.A. No. 11212, arguing that these provisions encroach on its constitutional right to due process[11] and equal protection.[12] PECO alleged that the authority granted to MORE to takeover PECO's business by seizing its assets under the veil of expropriation cannot be done without violating its right to substantive due process.[13] PECO also pointed out provisions in R.A. No. 11212 that are not present in other legislative franchises granted to distribution utilities and that MORE is given more leeway in its exercise of the right of eminent domain as compared to other distribution utilities.[14] For PECO, the grant of authority to expropriate all of its assets is arbitrary and unduly oppressive.[15] PECO also claimed that R.A. No. 11212 authorized taking that is not for public use.[16] Meanwhile, on March 11, 2019, MORE filed a Complaint for Expropriation with the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Iloilo City over the distribution system of PECO in the same city.[17] On March 14, 2019, the RTC issued a Temporary Restraining Order enjoining the commencement of expropriation proceedings, the takeover by MORE of the distribution system in Iloilo City, and the issuance of a CPCN by the ERC in favor of MORE.[18] On July 1, 2019, upon motion by PECO for judgment on the pleadings, the RTC rendered its Judgment,[19] the dispositive portion of which states: WHEREFORE, premises considered, judgment is hereby rendered declaring Section 10 and 17 of RA No. 11212 void and unconstitutional for infringing on PECO's rights to due process and equal protection of the law. Consequently, PECO has no obligation to sell and respondent has no right to expropriate PECO's assets under Sections 10 and 17 of RA No. 11212; and, PECO's rights to its properties are protected against arbitrary and confiscatory taking under the relevant portions of Sections 10 and 17 of RA No. 11212. Finally, the Temporary Restraining Order dated 14 March 2019 insofar as it enjoins respondent MORE and/ or any of its representatives from enforcing, implementing and exercising any of the rights and obligations set forth under RA 11212, including but not limited to commencing or pursuing the expropriation proceedings against petitioner PECO under the assailed provisions; and takeover by respondent MORE of petitioner PECO's distribution assets in the franchise area is hereby made permanent. SO ORDERED.[20] The RTC found the element of public use wanting in the present case. The RTC explained that PECO's properties, including the distribution assets, are already being devoted to public use and that the only tangible effect of the exercise of eminent domain is to replace PECO with MORE as the owner of the existing electric power distribution system in Iloilo City. For the RTC, the State should not intervene in this corporate take-over.[21] The RTC also held that there is no substantial distinction between MORE, on the one hand, and all other distribution utilities, on the other, to warrant the unwarranted benefits granted to MORE.[22] MORE filed a petition for review on certiorari under Rule 45 before this Court, docketed as G.R. No. 248061, raising the constitutional question of whether Sections 10 and 17 of R.A. No. 11212 violate the constitutional guarantee of due process and equal protection of laws. It posed the legal question in this wise: \"[m]ay the distribution assets of a power distribution company whose franchise has expired, be acquired by a new power distribution utility with the new franchise, through expropriation, to ensure the continuous and uninterrupted service in the franchise area?\"[23] MORE argued that expropriation under Sections 10 and 17 of R.A. No. 11212 serves the distinct emergency public purpose of ensuring the continuous and uninterrupted supply of electricity in Iloilo City, as the city transitions from the old franchise holder to the new franchise holder. Sections 10 and 17 recognize that MORE is differently situated from other distribution utilities. For one, there is already an existing distribution system in Iloilo City that continues to burden public space. This distribution system occupies streets, land, and properties owned by the government. MORE further averred that the clear legislative intent under R.A. No. 11212 is for MORE, as the new franchisee, to take over the operation of the distribution system in Iloilo City and to pay just compensation to PECO. A separate petition for review on certiorari was filed by the Republic of the Philippines, through the Office of the Solicitor General (OSG), docketed as G.R. No. 249406. The OSG argued that R.A. No. 9136,[24] otherwise known as the \"Electric Power Industry Reform Act of 2001\" (EPIRA) delegated to public utilities like MORE the power of eminent domain to enable them to exercise their public function. Section 17 of R.A. No. 11212 emphasized a specific public need, which is to ease the transition of operations from PECO to MORE by expressly providing that the right of MORE to expropriate the distribution system of PECO for the public purpose of electricity and power distribution system, will not be prejudiced by the interim authority given to PECO to continue to operate the said system for the very same purpose of power distribution. On motion[25] of PECO, G.R. Nos. 248061 and 249406 were consolidated.Decision dated September 15, 2020 of this Court On September 15, 2020, this Court rendered its Decision reversing and setting aside the Decision dated July 1, 2019 of the RTC. The Court declared Sections 1 0 and 17 of R.A. No. 11212 constitutional. The Court held that: (1) the legislative franchise of PECO authorizing it to operate a distribution system in Iloilo City is susceptible to expropriation for the same public purpose of power and electricity distribution; and (2) the expropriation by MORE of the distribution system of PECO pursuant to Sections 10 and 17 of R.A. No. 11212 is in accordance with the constitutional requirements of due process and equal protection of laws. The Court took into account the history of the legislative franchises governing the distribution system in Iloilo City which established that the distribution system of PECO can be subjected to expropriation for the same public purpose. Further, the Court ruled that the expropriation of the distribution system of PECO under Sections 10 and 17 of R.A. No. 11212 serves both the general public interest of conveying Rower and electricity in Iloilo City and the peculiar public interest and security of ensuring the uninterrupted supply of electricity. PECO'S Motion for Reconsideration In its Motion for Reconsideration,[26] PECO asks the Court to take a second hard look at the facts surrounding the case and the alleged far-reaching legal implications of the Decision dated September 15, 2020. PECO faults the Court in allowing the expropriation of its distribution system for the same public purpose it was already devoted to.[27] While PECO concedes that its previous legislative franchise allows expropriation of its assets and distribution system upon the termination of its franchise, this power maybe exercised only by the government and its political subdivisions, should it desire to operate and maintain the system by itself, and not by private entities such as MORE.[28] Additionally, PECO disagrees with the conclusion of the Court that its ownership of the distribution system is co-existent with its franchise. PECO insists that franchise merely pertains to the privilege granted by the government and not synonymous to ownership of the facilities used thereof.[29] Further, PECO insists that there is no genuine public purpose served by the transfer of its distribution system to MORE. PECO alleges that the inexperience and incompetence of MORE in the business of electric distribution adversely affects the public.[30] PECO claims that the Court erroneously held that the expropriation is needed to prevent any disruption in the supply of electricity. According to PECO, as the distribution system is not burdened with public use and is privately owned by PECO, it can devote the same to private use; such as by disposing the system or by using it in another business. PECO proposes that MORE should establish, operate, and maintain its own distribution system.[31] PECO maintains that the expropriation of its distribution system violates its right to due process of law. According to PECO, to successfully invoke the exercise of eminent domain, it is required that there is a compelling state interest and that the means employed to effect it should be least restrictive.[32] Lastly, PECO insists that Sections 10 and 17 of R.A. No. 11212 violate its constitutional right to equal protection of laws because MORE was given undue and unwarranted benefits[33] and for having been singled out as the only entity against whom expropriation may be directed.[34]MORE's Opposition MORE counters that PECO's distribution assets are not sacrosanct private property that PECO has absolute discretion on how and when to dispose. The distribution system assets are regulated assets established for the sole purpose of supplying electricity to end-users in Iloilo City. MORE avers that PECO had no more right to occupy public streets and skyline when its franchise expired, thus, PECO had the obligation to uproot, dismantle and remove its posts, wires, transformers, and electric meters from the streets and skyline of Iloilo City. The public space that they occupy are now under easement for use of MORE under its franchise. MORE posits that the cost of regulated assets have been charged to and paid for by the consumers in Iloilo City. The consumers of Iloilo City have the right to the continued use of these regulated assets to serve their basic need for electricity, as provided for under the EPIRA. Further, MORE contends that to require it to build a new distribution system is anti-consumer and would deny the consumers of Iloilo City their right to continued service. The determination of MORE's technical competence and capability to operate the distribution system in Iloilo City is a matter within the primary jurisdiction of the ERC. Also, the matter of just compensation is an issue which must be resolved in the expropriation court.Issue The primary issue to be resolved is whether Sections 10 and 17 of R.A. No. 11212 are constitutional. Ruling of the Court After a careful review of the arguments raised by PECO, the Court finds no reason to depart from its Decision dated September 15, 2020. The issues raised in the Motion for Reconsideration have been squarely and extensively discussed in the Court's Decision dated September 15, 2020. Nonetheless, the Court deems it prudent to clarity and discuss further the matters raised in the Motion. A franchise emanates from the constitutional power of the Legislature to grant concessions and privileges to private entities. A franchise stated out as a \"royal privilege or (a) branch of the King's prerogative, subsisting in the hands of a subject.\"[35] This definition was given by Finch, adopted by Blackstone, and accepted by every authority since.[36] Further, \"a franchise is defined to be a special privilege to, do certain things conferred by government on an individual or corporation, and which does not belong to citizens generally of common right.\"[37] Insofar as the great powers of government are concerned, \"[a] franchise is basically a legislative grant of a special privilege to a person.\"[38] Section 11, Article XII of the 1987 Constitution further states that \"x x x for the operation of a public utility,\" no \"such franchise or right [shall] be granted except under the condition that it shall be subject to amendment, alteration, or repeal by the Congress when the common good so requires. x x x\" Pursuant to this prerogative of the State, Section 27 of the EPIRA vests on Congress the power to grant franchises to persons engaged in the transmission and distribution of electricity, to wit: Section Franchising Power in the Electric Power Sector. - The power to grant franchises to persons engaged in the transmission and distribution of electricity shall be vested exclusively in the Congress of the Philippines and all laws inconsistent with this Act particularly, but not limited to, Section 43 of PD 269, otherwise known as the \"National Electrification Decree\", are hereby deemed repealed or modified accordingly: Provided, That all existing franchises shall be allowed to their full term: Provided, further, That in the case of electric cooperatives, renewals and cancellations shall remain with the National Electrification Commission under the National Electrification Administration for five (5) more years after the enactment of this Act. Since 1923 until January 18, 2019, PECO was the holder of a franchise to \"establish, operate, and maintain, for commercial purposes and in the public interest, a distribution system for the conveyance of electric power to end users in the City of Iloilo.\"[39] However, upon the expiration of PECO's franchise in 2019, Congress, exercising its constitutionally-mandated and plenary power to grant franchises, did not renew the privilege given to PECO. Instead, it awarded the franchise to MORE, as embodied in R.A. No. 11212. The power of Congress to award the franchise to MORE is broad and plenary, subject only to limitations given by the Constitution and the fundamental principle of due process. It is beyond the power of the Court to question the wisdom of Congress in granting the franchise to MORE. The Court cannot venture into this because that would mean violating the deep-rooted principle of separation of powers. Thus, Sections 10 and 17 of R.A. No. 11212, giving MORE the power to expropriate the distribution system of PECO, are but integral parts of the grant of the franchise by Congress. Since the exercise of eminent domain is necessary to carry out the franchise, it is prudent that the Court accords respect to the legislative will. The authority granted to MORE under its franchise to expropriate the existing distribution system of PECO is a valid delegation of power. In its motion for reconsideration, PECO faults the Court in allowing the expropriation of its distribution system for the same public purpose it was already devoted to. While PECO concedes that its previous legislative franchise allows expropriation of its assets and distribution system upon the termination of its franchise, it also asserts that this power may be exercised only by the government and its political subdivisions, and not by private entities such as MORE. PECO's argument fails to convince the Court. The power of eminent domain is exercised by the Legislature. However, it may be delegated by Congress to the President, administrative bodies, local government units, and even to private enterprises performing public services.[40] The exercise of the right to expropriate given to MORE under its franchise is a delegated authority granted by Congress. The restrictive view that expropriation may be exercised by the State alone, without any consideration for the State's authority to delegate its powers, cannot be upheld. Being a private enterprise allowed by the Congress to operate a public utility for public interest, the delegation by Congress of the power to expropriate PECO's distribution system is valid. The requisites for a valid exercise of the power of eminent domain are present. Over the years and in a plethora of cases, this Court has recognized the following requisites for the valid exercise of the power of eminent domain: (1) the property taken must be private property; (2) there must be genuine necessity to take the private property; (3) the taking must be for public use; (4) there must be payment of just compensation; and (5) the taking must comply with due process of law.[41] It is settled that a property already devoted to public use can still be subject to expropriation, provided this is done directly by the national legislature or under a specific grant of authority to a delegate,[42] as in the case of MORE. In this case, PECO insists that there is no genuine public purpose served by the transfer through expropriation of its distribution system to MORE. PECO claims that the Court erroneously held that the expropriation is needed to prevent any disruption in the supply of electricity. According to PECO, as the distribution system is not burdened with public use, it can devote the same to private use, such as by disposing the system or by using it in another business. In other words, PECO zeroes in on the alleged absence of the second and third requisites for a valid exercise of the power of eminent domain. It is established that the foundation of the right to exercise eminent domain is genuine necessity, and that necessity must be of a public character. As a rule, the determination of whether there is genuine necessity for the exercise is a justiciable question. However, when the power is exercised by the Legislature, the question of necessity is essentially a matter that the Legislature can decide and determine. Thus, in City of Manila v. Chinese Community,[43] the Court held: The legislature, in providing for the exercise of the power of eminent domain, may directly determine the necessity for appropriating private property for a particular improvement for public use, and it may select the exact location of the improvement. In such a case, it is well-settled that the utility of the proposed improvement, the extent of the public necessity for its construction, the expediency of constructing it, the suitableness of the location selected and the consequent necessity of taking the land selected for its site, are all questions exclusively for the legislature to determine, and the courts have no power to interfere, or to substitute their own views for those of the representatives of the people.[44] As in this case, the express authority of MORE to expropriate is embodied in R.A. No. 11212. The expropriation of the distribution system of PECO was directed by legislation. To validly exercise the power of eminent domain, it is also required that taking should be for public use. The meaning of the term \"public use\" has evolved over time in response to changing public needs and exigencies. Public use, which was traditionally understood as strictly limited to actual \"use by the public,\" has developed an expansive meaning. \"Public use\" is now synonymous with \"public interest,\" \"public benefit,\" and \"public convenience.\"[45] At present, it may not be amiss to state that whatever is beneficially employed for the general welfare satisfies the requirement of public use.[46] In this case, expropriation under Sections 10 and 17 of R.A. No. 11212 is for the general purpose of electricity distribution. Electricity distribution no doubt affects the public welfare. The assailed provisions ensure uninterrupted supply of electricity in the city during the transition from the old to the new franchisee. Iloilo City's public space is already burdened by PECO's existing distribution system. Yet, the distribution system cannot continue to operate under PECO's franchise as this has not been renewed by Congress. The public necessity of ensuring uninterrupted electricity is clear in Section 10 of R.A. No. 11212 when it authorized MORE to expropriate the existing distribution system. The provision reads: Section 10. Right of Eminent Domain. \u2013 Subject to the limitations and procedures prescribed by law, the grantee is authorized to exercise the power of eminent domain insofar as it may be reasonably necessary for the efficient establishment, improvement, upgrading, rehabilitation, maintenance and operation of its services. The grantee is authorized to install and maintain its poles wires, and other facilities over, under, and across public property, including streets, highways, parks, and other similar property of the Government of the Philippines, its branches, or any of its instrumentalities. The grantee may acquire such private property as is actually necessary for the realization of the purposes for which this franchise is granted, including, but not limited to poles, wires, cables, transformers, switching equipment and stations, buildings, infrastructure, machineries and equipment previously, currently or actually used, or intended to be used, or have been abandoned, unused or underutilized, or which obstructs its facilities, for the operation of a distribution system for the conveyance of electric power to end users in its franchise area: Provided, That proper expropriation proceedings shall have been instituted and just compensation paid:Provided, further, That upon the filing of the petition tor expropriation, or at any time thereafter, and after due notice to the owner of the property to be expropriated and the deposit in a bank located in the franchise area of the full amount of the value of the property or properties, the grantee shall be entitled to immediate possession, operation, control, use and disposition of the properties sought to be expropriated, including the power of demolition, if necessary, notwithstanding the pendency of other issues before the court, including the final determination of the amount of just compensation to be paid. The court may appoint a representative from the ERC as a trial commissioner in determining the amount of just compensation. The court may consider the tax declarations, current audited financial statements, and rate-setting applications of the owner or owners of the property or properties expropriated in order to determine their assessed value. The distinct genuine public necessity is reiterated in Section 17 thereof which allowed MORE to initiate expropriation proceedings even if PECO is provisionally operating the distribution system. Section 17 of R.A. No. 11212 states: Section 17. Transition of Operations. - In the public interest and to ensure uninterrupted supply of electricity, the current operator, Panay Electric Company, Inc. (PECO), shall in the interim be authorized to operate the existing distribution system within the franchise area, as well as implement its existing power supply agreements with generation companies that had been provisionally or finally approved by the ERC until the establishment or acquisition by the grantee of its own distribution system and complete transition towards full operations as determined by the ERC which period shall in no case exceed two (2) from the grant of this legislative franchise. Upon compliance with its rules, the ERC shall grant PECO the provisional certificate of public convenience and necessity (CPCN) covering such interim period. The applicable generation rate shall be the provisional or final rate approved by the ERC. This provisional authority to operate during the transition period shall not be construed as extending the franchise of PECO after its expiration on January 18, 2019, and it shall not prevent the grantee from exercising the right of eminent domain over the distribution assets existing at the franchise area as provided in Section 10 of this Act. During such interim period, the ERC shall require PECO to settle the full amount which the ERC has directed to refund to its customers in connection with all the cases filed against it. To reduce the length of the transition period, the ERC and all agencies issuing the requisite licenses shall prioritize all applications relevant to the establishment and operation of the distribution system under its franchise. The grantee shall, as far as practicable and subject to required qualifications, accord preference to hiring former employees of PECO upon commencement of business operations. An information dissemination campaign regarding public services and operations of the grantee shall be made to all end-users in the franchise area. The grantee and PECO shall jointly ensure that employees not hired by the grantee shall receive all separation and/or retirement benefits they are entitled to in accordance with applicable laws. The DOE shall, during the transition, ensure that there will be uninterrupted supply of electricity in the existing franchise area. It must be highlighted that in carrying out the obligations of MORE in its legislative franchise, time is of the essence. MORE is only given two years from the grant of the legislative franchise, or from July 23, 2018, to either establish its own distribution system or acquire the existing distribution system through the exercise of eminent domain. This is consistent with the State's objective of ensuring uninterrupted supply of electricity in the city. MORE considered it practical to exercise the power of eminent domain as there are already existing structures which would facilitate unimpeded transition from PECO to MORE. In National Electrification Administration v. Maguindanao Electric Cooperative, Inc.,[47] the Court recognized the authority of National Electrification Administration (NEA) under Presidential Decree (PD) No. 269, to order the transfer of the distribution assets of Maguindanao Electric Cooperative, Inc. to Cotabato Electric Cooperative, Inc. the new franchise holder. Under PD No. 269, NEA had the power to acquire assets which includes the exercise of the right to eminent domain. The Court upheld NEA's right of eminent domain necessary in the pursuit of the declared policy of nationwide electrification. Notably in the said case, the transfer of distribution assets involves two private entities pursuant to the enforcement of the right to exercise eminent domain. Recently approved on August 8, 2019 is R.A. No. 11361,[48] otherwise known as the \"Anti-Obstruction of Power Lines Act,\" which recognized the policy of the State to ensure uninterrupted conveyance of electricity from generating plants to end-users. It further acknowledged that the uninterrupted conveyance of electricity is a matter of national security and is essential to sustaining the country's economic development. Section 13 of the same Act provides for the right of eminent domain granted to any person with a franchise to operate, manage, or maintain the electric power line as governed by the pertinent provisions of the Rules of Court. In sum, expropriation by MORE of the distribution system of PECO under Sections 10 and 17 of R.A. No. 11212 serves both the general public interest of conveying power and electricity in Iloilo City and the peculiar public interest and security of ensuring the uninterrupted supply of electricity. The allegation of PECO that it was singled-out and the perceived incidental benefit enjoyed by MORE do not render Sections 10 and 17 of R.A. No. 11212 unconstitutional. Contrary to the claim of PECO, it was not singled-out. There was also no undue benefit given to MORE to justify the invalidation of Sections 10 and 17 of its legislative franchise. The right to exercise eminent domain conferred by Section 10 of R.A. No. 11212 remains valid, regardless of any perceived incidental benefit to be gained or enjoyed by MORE, for as long as the requisites for the exercise of a valid expropriation was complied with. 1 There is no basis to support the claim of PECO that it has been \"singled\u00ad out\" by the approval of the franchise of MORE. There is only one franchise holder in the subject area prior to the enactment of R.A. No. 11212. It is but natural and expected that PECO, as the lone previous franchise holder which failed to secure the renewal of its franchise, will be averse to any arid all subsequent franchise holder exercising the right of eminent domain. Nonetheless, this does not mean that PECO can simply ask the nullification of the legislative franchise awarded to MORE for being \"singled-out.\" It must be emphasized that a legislative franchise is merely a privilege and not a right that may be demanded by any individual or entity. The Court cannot substitute the judgment of the Congress with its own with respect to the determination of which entity it deems most qualified to carry out the distribution of electricity in Iloilo City. It must be remembered that the Constitution has delineated separate and quite distinct roles that each branch of government must fill. In the exercise of judicial review, the Court is limited to the determination of the constitutionality of R.A. No. 11212. The Court does not possess the technical knowledge required in the field of power distribution to competently evaluate the capacity of MORE to carry out its functions under R.A. No. 11212. Resolving whether PECO deserves to be granted an extension or renewal of its franchise and whether MORE is qualified as a new franchisee are matters clearly beyond the ambit or the Court's authority to review as these are purely matters left to the wisdom of Congress. Likewise, the incidental benefit enjoyed by MORE does not render its legislative franchise unconstitutional. As fittingly explained by Associate Justice Alfredo Benjamin S. Caguioa in his Separate Opinion,[49] x x x [W]hile the exercise of the power of eminent domain over the electric power distribution facilities of PECO may garner benefits in favor of MORE, this would be but incidental. Notably, its duties as a public utility would nonetheless remain regulated by the government. At the end of the day, at the proper expropriation proceedings instituted for the purpose, the abiding reality would be for the court to be satisfied with evidence proffered by MORE \u2013 that its intended taking would invariably be for the good of the public, is actually necessary, and that there is just compensation therefor.[50] It is important to highlight that the incidental private benefit MORE enjoys does not override the paramount public interest on which the right of eminent domain is hinged. It would be unfair for the public to be deprived of access to uninterrupted supply of electricity, an important tool to economic growth, simply because of some incidental benefit MORE may gain from its legislative franchise. Moreover, as aptly pointed out by Senior Associate Justice Estela Perlas-Bernabe in her Separate Opinion,[51] MORE is not the only entity engaged in the business of distribution utilities accorded with a similar authority to exercise eminent domain embedded in a legislative franchise. The respective legislative franchises of the following entities contain a similar provision: (1) Cotabato Electric Cooperative, Inc.\u2013PPALMA (under R.A. No. 11322); (2) Cotabato Light and Power Company (under R.A. No. 10637); (3) First Bay Power Corp. (under R.A. No. 10891); (4) Angeles Electric Corporation (under R.A. No. 9381); and (5) Olongapo Electricity Distribution Company, Inc. (under R.A. No. 10373).[52] It is erroneous for PECO to argue that only the State and its subdivisions or the local government units may exercise the power of eminent domain. Noticeably, these franchise holders are cooperatives and private corporations. Therefore, it cannot simply be concluded that the Congress, in enacting R.A. No. 11212, extended favorable concessions to MORE to the exclusion of all other distribution utilities because other private entities such as the cooperatives and private corporations mentioned enjoy similar privileges. It is also worthy to point out that MORE is under a unique circumstance and is faced with an unusual obstacle. It is mandated to assume the operations of PECO, whose facilities are already existing and occupied by its employees, while simultaneously ensuring that the distribution of electricity to various areas in Iloilo City remain uninterrupted during the interim period. Though not impossible to accomplish, the Congress deemed it prudent to confer the power provided in Sections 10 and 17 of R.A. No. 11212 to guaranty that the transition phase will not hamper the duty of the franchisee to supply electric power, an essential necessity in the lives of people residing in Iloilo City. The Court, speaking through the ponencia of Associate Justice Jose C. Reyes, Jr., explained that: MORE is a new franchise holder that is virtually deprived of the option to set up a new distribution system, not only because the existing public space is burdened with the distribution system of the old franchise holder, but also because it must hit the ground running and ensure the uninterrupted and continuous supply of electricity to the city. MORE is therefore peculiarly and doubly burdened. It must not only supply electricity, it must also prevent any disruption that might arise from its takeover of the franchise.[53] Clearly, in granting MORE the right to exercise eminent domain, the primordial concern of the Congress is the welfare of the residents of Iloilo City who rely on the distribution system of PECO. There is no question that PECO's franchise was not renewed, thus, it can no longer operate the distribution system in Iloilo City. MORE, as the new franchisee, is mandated under Section 2 of R.A. No. 11212 to operate and maintain the distribution system in the best manner possible. To be able to do so, its right to expropriate the distribution system in Iloilo City to ensure uninterrupted supply of electricity should not be hampered by unfounded allegations of undue benefit and corporate takeover. In the end, the net public benefit generated from the exercise of the right of eminent domain outweighs any and all incidental and secondary benefit any private entity, including MORE, may acquire. In view of the foregoing, the constitutionality of Sections 10 and 17 of R.A. No. 11212 must be upheld.WHEREFORE, the Motion for Reconsideration is DENIED.SO ORDERED.Peralta, C.J., Perlas-Bernabe, Caguioa, Gesmundo, Hernando, Rosario, and Lopez, JJ., concur.Leonen and Lazaro-Javier, JJ., dissent.

No. 11212 states: Section 10. Right of Eminent Domain. - Subject to the limitations and procedures prescribed by law, the grantee is authorized to exercise the power of eminent domain insofar as it may be reasonably necessary for the efficient establishment, improvement, upgrading, rehabilitation, maintenance and operation of its services. The grantee is authorized to install and maintain its poles wires, and other facilities over, under, and across public property, including streets, highways, parks, and other similar property of the Government of the Philippines, its branches, or any of its instrumentalities. The grantee may acquire such private property as is actually necessary for the realization of the purposes for which this franchise is granted, including, but not limited to poles, wires, cables, transformers, switching equipment and stations, buildings, infrastructure, machineries and equipment previously, currently or actually used, or intended to be used, or have been abandoned, unused or underutilized, or which obstructs its facilities, for the operation of a distribution system for the conveyance of electric power to end users in its franchise area: Provided, That proper expropriation proceedings shall have been instituted and just compensation paid:Provided, farther, That upon the filing of the petition for expropriation, or at any time thereafter, and after clue notice to the owner of the property to be expropriated and the deposit in a bank located in the franchise area of the full amount of the assessed value of the property or properties, the grantee shall be entitled to immediate possession, operation, control, use and disposition of the properties sought to be expropriated, including the power of demolition, if necessary, notwithstanding the pendency of other issues before the court, including the final determination of the amount of just compensation to be paid. The court may appoint a representative from the ERC as a trial commissioner in determining the amount of just compensation. The court may consider the tax declarations, current audited financial statements, and rate-setting applications of the owner or owners of the property or properties being expropriated in order to determine their assessed value.[6] Rollo (G.R. No. 248061), p. 63. [7] Act No. 3035, Section 2. [8] Section 17, R.A. No. 11212 states: Section 17. Transition of Operations. \u2013 In the public interest and to ensure uninterrupted supply of electricity, the current operator, Panay Electric Company, Inc. (PECO), shall in the interim be authorized to operate the existing distribution system within the franchise area, as well as implement its existing power supply agreements with generation companies that had been provisionally or finally approved by the ERC until the establishment or acquisition by the grantee of its own distribution system and its complete transition towards full operations as determined by the ERC, which period shall in no case exceed two (2) years from the grant of this legislative franchise. Upon compliance with its rules, the ERC shall grant PECO the necessary provisional certificate of public convenience and necessity (CPCN) covering such interim period. The applicable generation rate shall be the provisional or final rate approved by the ERC. This provisional authority to operate during the transition period shall not be construed as extending the franchise of PECO after its expiration on January 18, 2019, and it shall not prevent the grantee from exercising the right of eminent domain over the distribution assets existing at the franchise area as provided in Section 10 of this Act. During such interim period, the ERC shall require PECO to settle the full amount which the ERC has directed to refund to its customers in connection with all the cases filed against it. To reduce the length of the transition period, the ERC and all agencies issuing the requisite licenses shall prioritize all applications relevant to the establishment and operation of the distribution system under its franchise. The grantee shall, as far as practicable and subject to required qualifications, accord preference to hiring former employees of PECO upon commencement of business operations. An information dissemination campaign regarding public services and operations of the grantee shall be made to all end-users in the franchise area. The grantee and PECO shall jointly ensure that employees not hired by the grantee shall receive all separation and/or retirement benefits they are entitled to in accordance with applicable laws. The DOE shall, during the transition, ensure that there will be uninterrupted supply of electricity in the existing franchise area.[9] Rollo (G .R. No. 248061), p. 288. [10] Id. at 60-95.

DISSENTING OPINION LEONEN, J.: I reiterate the statements I made in my September 15, 2020 Dissent.[1] Sections 10[2] and 17[3] of Republic Act No. 11212 are unconstitutional. They violate the equal protection clause, granting electricity franchise to a corporation strikingly inexperienced in supplying electricity. The provisions unduly discriminate against other public utilities, especially the former electric utility operating in Iloilo City, as well as those similarly situated to the new franchisee but, for reasons unclear, were not given the same concessions. Worse, the private property taken is not for public use. All that Sections 10 and 17 allow is a transfer of property from one private corporation to another for the same public purpose to which it was originally devoted. The inefficient monopolistic operation of the electric utility in Iloilo city remains, with no real improvement. In reality, the taking here only serves private interests, and whatever benefit the public gets is only incidental. The Motion for Reconsideration should therefore be granted and the Decision of the Mandaluyong trial court affirmed.I While broad and plenary,[4] as the majority states, the power of Congress to grant franchises for the operation of a public utility is always subject to the provisions of the Constitution. The foremost limitation is provided in Section 1 of the Bill of Rights: \"no person shall be deprived of life, liberty, or property without due process of law, nor shall any person be denied the equal protection of the laws.\" In my September 15, 2020 Dissent, I outlined how Section 10 of Republic Act No. 11212 violates the equal protection clause. The right of eminent domain delegated to More Electric Power Corporation (More Electric) constitutes class legislation\u2014a law that discriminates against some but favors others.[5] Reading Section 10 in isolation will not lead to this conclusion. However, when read in conjunction with the eminent domain provisions of other electricity franchises, the unwarranted benefits granted to More Electric becomes apparent. Section 10 of Republic Act No. 11212 provides: SECTION 10. Right of Eminent Domain. \u2014 Subject to the limitations and procedures prescribed by law, the grantee is authorized to exercise the power of eminent domain insofar as it may be reasonably necessary for the efficient establishment, improvement, upgrading, rehabilitation, maintenance and operation of its services. The grantee is authorized to install and maintain its poles wires, and other facilities over, under, and across public property, including streets, highways, parks, and other similar property of the Government of the Philippines, its branches, or any of its instrumentalities. The grantee may acquire such private property as is actually necessary for the realization of the purposes for which this franchise is granted, including, but not limited to poles, wires, cables, transformers, switching equipment and stations, buildings, infrastructure, machineries and equipment previously, currently or actually used, or intended to be used, or have been abandoned, unused or underutilized, or which obstructs its facilities, for the operation of a distribution system for the conveyance of electric power to end users in its franchise area: Provided, That proper expropriation proceedings shall have been instituted and just compensation paid:Provided, further, That upon the filing of the petition for expropriation, or at any time thereafter, and after due notice to the owner of the property to be expropriated and the deposit in a bank located in the franchise area of the full amount of the assessed value of the property or properties, the grantee shall be entitled to immediate possession, operation, control, use and disposition of the properties sought to be expropriated, including the power of demolition, if necessary, notwithstanding the pendency of other issues before the court, including the final determination of the amount of just compensation to be paid. The court may appoint a representative from the ERC as a trial commissioner in determining the amount of just compensation. The court may consider the tax declarations, current audited financial statements, and rate-setting applications of the owner or owners of the property or properties being expropriated in order to determine their assessed value. (Emphasis supplied) On the other hand, the eminent domain provision in Panay Electric Company, Inc.'s (Panay Electric) expired franchise states: SECTION 4. It is expressly provided that in the event the Government should desire to operate and maintain for itself the system and enterprise herein authorized, the grantee shall surrender its franchise and will turn over to the government all equipment therein at fair market value. As can be gleaned from the provisions, More Electric may exercise its delegated power of eminent domain over properties \"previously, currently or actually used . . . for the operation of a distribution system for the conveyance of electric power to end users\" in Iloilo City. These properties are no other than those used by the former electric utility, Panay Electric. Further, Section 10 allows More Electric to expropriate the properties of Panay Electric by mere payment of the full amount of their assessed value. This is in contrast to Section 4 of Republic Act No. 5360, Panay Electric's expired franchise, which allows the government itself: not a mere delegate like More Electric, to exercise its power of eminent domain upon payment of fair market value. Assessed value being a mere percentage of the fair market value,[6] it is clear that Section 10 allows More Electric to exercise its delegated eminent domain powers by paying a significantly lower amount compared to what the government would have paid had it expropriated the properties of Panay Electric. This difference in the payable amount is a clear benefit to More Electric. This difference is highlighted further by comparing Section 10 of Republic Act No. 11212 with the eminent domain provisions found in legislative franchises of other electric utilities.

Right of Eminent Domain. \u2014 Subject to the limitations and procedures prescribed by law, the grantee is authorized to exercise the right of eminent domain insofar as it may be reasonably necessary for the efficient maintenance and operation of services. The grantee is authorized to install and maintain its poles, wires, and other facilities over and across public property, including streets, highways, forest reserves, and other similar property of the Government of the Philippines, its branches, or any of its instrumentalities. The grantee may acquire such private property as is actually necessary for the realization of the purposes for which this franchise is granted: Provided, That proper condemnation proceedings shall have been instituted and just compensation paid.Apart from having a more detailed eminent domain provision, Republic Act No. 11212, in Section 17,[7] even allows More Electric to acquire the workforce of Panay Electric. No provisions similar to Section 17 can be found in the legislative franchises of other electric utilities. These differences matter because More Electric has no experience in the business of supplying electricity. To be an allowable discrimination under the equal protection clause, the discrimination must, at the very least, be reasonable.[8] Indulging a corporation with all of these benefits, when it has no expertise in the business it seeks to operate, cannot be reasonable. This unreasonableness is more glaring considering that the supply of electricity is a business imbued with public interest.II Moreover, Section 10 of Republic Act No. 11212 violates Article III, Section 9 of the Constitution as it allows the taking of private property not for public use. The definition of \"public use\" has evolved from the literal \"actual use by the public\" to \"public purpose,\"[9] \"'public advantage or benefit,\"[10] and \"public welfare.\"[11] Admittedly, the supply of electricity is one for public advantage and benefit. Nevertheless, if property is taken for the same public use to which it was originally devoted, there is no true expropriation. As early as 1921, this Court in Se\u00f1a v. Manila Railroad Co. and Insular Government[12] noted how \"the meaning of the term 'public use' [is] one of constant growth\"[13] and that \"[a]s society advances, its demands upon the individual increase and each demand is a new use to which the resources of the individual may be devoted.\"[14] This implies that a true expropriation requires a new a public use. Thus, if property is taken then subsequently devoted to the same public use, there is only a transfer of property from one entity to another. All the exercise of eminent domain results in is a change as to who the profits.[15] Therefore, the taking primarily serves proprietary interests, with little to no regard to the interests of the public. Any public interest is only a pretense or incidental at best. More Electric seeks to expropriate the properties of Panay Electric for the continued and uninterrupted supply of electricity in Iloilo City. This is the exact same public use to which Panay Electric devoted its properties. It must be emphasized that More Electric has no experience in electricity distribution and has no assets of its own to distribute electricity in Iloilo City. The electricity distribution system, even the workforce that would be operating the system, will be the same. All this case involves is a forced transfer of properties from Panay Electric to More Electric. The taking is not for public use but in the service of proprietary interests. The majority concludes with this: \"in granting MORE the right to exercise eminent domain, the primordial concern of the Congress is the welfare of the residents of Iloilo City.\" [16] I cannot see this. All I see is a law giving a semblance of legitimacy to what actually is an abuse of the expropriation powers of the State. I therefore dissent.IN VIEW OF THE FOREGOING, I vote to GRANT the Motion for Reconsideration and AFFIRM the July 1, 2019 Judgment of the Regional Trial Court, Branch 209, Mandaluyong City in Civil Case No. R\u00adMND-1900571.[1] Dissenting Opinion of J.

PANAY ELECTRIC COMPANY, INC., RESPONDENT.\n\nR E S O L U T I O N\n\nCARANDANG, J.:\n\nFor resolution is the Motion for Reconsideration [1] filed by respondent Panay Electric Company, Inc. (PECO) of the Court's Decision [2] dated September 15, 2020 of this Court, the dispositive portion of which reads:\n\nWHEREFORE , the instant Petitions are GRANTED . The assailed Judgment dated July 1, 2019 is REVERSED and SET ASIDE . Section 10 and 17 of Republic Act No. 11212 are DECLARED CONSTITUTIONAL .\n\nSO ORDERED. [3] (Emphasis in the original)\n\nAntecedents\n\nOn July 23, 2018, Republic Act (R.A.) No. 11212 [4] was enacted granting petitioner More Electric and Power Corporation (MORE) a franchise to establish, operate, and maintain an electric power distribution system in Iloilo City. Section 10 of R.A. No. 11212 [5] confers on MORE the authority to exercise the right of eminent domain.\n\nThe distribution system, which is presently being used in Iloilo City, comprises of \"five 5 sub-transmission line substations, 450 kilometers of electrical lines, 20,000 poles, 1,300 transformers and 64,000 electrical meters\" [6] owned by PECO, a holder of the franchise since 1922. [7] The franchise of PECO expired on January 18, 2019 and no new franchise had been issued in its favor.\n\nNonetheless, since MORE has not established its service yet, Section 17 of R.A. No. 11212 permits PECO to continue operating the existing distribution system during the interim period. [8] Accordingly, through a Provisional Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity (CPCN) that the Energy Regulatory Commission (ERC) on May 21, 2019 issued, PECO continues to operate its existing distribution system. [9] The same provision also states that even if PECO is operating the distribution system, the interim arrangement shall not prevent MORE from acquiring the system through the exercise of the right of eminent domain.\n\nIncidentally, on March 6, 2019, PECO filed a Petition for Declaratory Relief [10] docketed as Civil Case No. R-MND-19-00571 assailing the constitutionality of Sections 10 and 17 of R.A. No. 11212, arguing that these provisions encroach on its constitutional right to due process [11] and equal protection. [12] PECO alleged that the authority granted to MORE to takeover PECO's business by seizing its assets under the veil of expropriation cannot be done without violating its right to substantive due process. [13] PECO also pointed out provisions in R.A. No. 11212 that are not present in other legislative franchises granted to distribution utilities and that MORE is given more leeway in its exercise of the right of eminent domain as compared to other distribution utilities. [14] For PECO, the grant of authority to expropriate all of its assets is arbitrary and unduly oppressive. [15] PECO also claimed that R.A. No. 11212 authorized taking that is not for public use. [16]\n\nMeanwhile, on March 11, 2019, MORE filed a Complaint for Expropriation with the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Iloilo City over the distribution system of PECO in the same city. [17]\n\nOn March 14, 2019, the RTC issued a Temporary Restraining Order enjoining the commencement of expropriation proceedings, the takeover by MORE of the distribution system in Iloilo City, and the issuance of a CPCN by the ERC in favor of MORE. [18]\n\nOn July 1, 2019, upon motion by PECO for judgment on the pleadings, the RTC rendered its Judgment, [19] the dispositive portion of which states:\n\nWHEREFORE, premises considered, judgment is hereby rendered declaring Section 10 and 17 of RA No. 11212 void and unconstitutional for infringing on PECO's rights to due process and equal protection of the law. Consequently, PECO has no obligation to sell and respondent has no right to expropriate PECO's assets under Sections 10 and 17 of RA No. 11212; and, PECO's rights to its properties are protected against arbitrary and confiscatory taking under the relevant portions of Sections 10 and 17 of RA No. 11212.\n\nFinally, the Temporary Restraining Order dated 14 March 2019 insofar as it enjoins respondent MORE and/ or any of its representatives from enforcing, implementing and exercising any of the rights and obligations set forth under RA 11212, including but not limited to commencing or pursuing the expropriation proceedings against petitioner PECO under the assailed provisions; and takeover by respondent MORE of petitioner PECO's distribution assets in the franchise area is hereby made permanent.\n\nSO ORDERED. [20]\n\nThe RTC found the element of public use wanting in the present case. The RTC explained that PECO's properties, including the distribution assets, are already being devoted to public use and that the only tangible effect of the exercise of eminent domain is to replace PECO with MORE as the owner of the existing electric power distribution system in Iloilo City. For the RTC, the State should not intervene in this corporate take-over. [21] The RTC also held that there is no substantial distinction between MORE, on the one hand, and all other distribution utilities, on the other, to warrant the unwarranted benefits granted to MORE. [22]\n\nMORE filed a petition for review on certiorari under Rule 45 before this Court, docketed as G.R. No. 248061, raising the constitutional question of whether Sections 10 and 17 of R.A. No. 11212 violate the constitutional guarantee of due process and equal protection of laws. It posed the legal question in this wise: \"[m]ay the distribution assets of a power distribution company whose franchise has expired, be acquired by a new power distribution utility with the new franchise, through expropriation, to ensure the continuous and uninterrupted service in the franchise area?\" [23]\n\nMORE argued that expropriation under Sections 10 and 17 of R.A. No. 11212 serves the distinct emergency public purpose of ensuring the continuous and uninterrupted supply of electricity in Iloilo City, as the city transitions from the old franchise holder to the new franchise holder. Sections 10 and 17 recognize that MORE is differently situated from other distribution utilities. For one, there is already an existing distribution system in Iloilo City that continues to burden public space. This distribution system occupies streets, land, and properties owned by the government. MORE further averred that the clear legislative intent under R.A. No. 11212 is for MORE, as the new franchisee, to take over the operation of the distribution system in Iloilo City and to pay just compensation to PECO.\n\nA separate petition for review on certiorari was filed by the Republic of the Philippines, through the Office of the Solicitor General (OSG), docketed as G.R. No. 249406. The OSG argued that R.A. No. 9136, [24] otherwise known as the \"Electric Power Industry Reform Act of 2001\" (EPIRA) delegated to public utilities like MORE the power of eminent domain to enable them to exercise their public function. Section 17 of R.A. No. 11212 emphasized a specific public need, which is to ease the transition of operations from PECO to MORE by expressly providing that the right of MORE to expropriate the distribution system of PECO for the public purpose of electricity and power distribution system, will not be prejudiced by the interim authority given to PECO to continue to operate the said system for the very same purpose of power distribution.\n\nOn motion [25] of PECO, G.R. Nos. 248061 and 249406 were consolidated.\n\nDecision dated September 15, 2020 of this Court\n\nOn September 15, 2020, this Court rendered its Decision reversing and setting aside the Decision dated July 1, 2019 of the RTC. The Court declared Sections 1 0 and 17 of R.A. No. 11212 constitutional. The Court held that: (1) the legislative franchise of PECO authorizing it to operate a distribution system in Iloilo City is susceptible to expropriation for the same public purpose of power and electricity distribution; and (2) the expropriation by MORE of the distribution system of PECO pursuant to Sections 10 and 17 of R.A. No. 11212 is in accordance with the constitutional requirements of due process and equal protection of laws. The Court took into account the history of the legislative franchises governing the distribution system in Iloilo City which established that the distribution system of PECO can be subjected to expropriation for the same public purpose. Further, the Court ruled that the expropriation of the distribution system of PECO under Sections 10 and 17 of R.A. No. 11212 serves both the general public interest of conveying Rower and electricity in Iloilo City and the peculiar public interest and security of ensuring the uninterrupted supply of electricity.\n\nPECO'S Motion for Reconsideration\n\nIn its Motion for Reconsideration, [26] PECO asks the Court to take a second hard look at the facts surrounding the case and the alleged far-reaching legal implications of the Decision dated September 15, 2020. PECO faults the Court in allowing the expropriation of its distribution system for the same public purpose it was already devoted to. [27] While PECO concedes that its previous legislative franchise allows expropriation of its assets and distribution system upon the termination of its franchise, this power maybe exercised only by the government and its political subdivisions, should it desire to operate and maintain the system by itself, and not by private entities such as MORE. [28] Additionally, PECO disagrees with the conclusion of the Court that its ownership of the distribution system is co-existent with its franchise. PECO insists that franchise merely pertains to the privilege granted by the government and not synonymous to ownership of the facilities used thereof. [29]\n\nFurther, PECO insists that there is no genuine public purpose served by the transfer of its distribution system to MORE. PECO alleges that the inexperience and incompetence of MORE in the business of electric distribution adversely affects the public. [30] PECO claims that the Court erroneously held that the expropriation is needed to prevent any disruption in the supply of electricity. According to PECO, as the distribution system is not burdened with public use and is privately owned by PECO, it can devote the same to private use; such as by disposing the system or by using it in another business. PECO proposes that MORE should establish, operate, and maintain its own distribution system. [31]\n\nPECO maintains that the expropriation of its distribution system violates its right to due process of law. According to PECO, to successfully invoke the exercise of eminent domain, it is required that there is a compelling state interest and that the means employed to effect it should be least restrictive. [32]\n\nLastly, PECO insists that Sections 10 and 17 of R.A. No. 11212 violate its constitutional right to equal protection of laws because MORE was given undue and unwarranted benefits [33] and for having been singled out as the only entity against whom expropriation may be directed. [34]\n\nMORE's Opposition\n\nMORE counters that PECO's distribution assets are not sacrosanct private property that PECO has absolute discretion on how and when to dispose. The distribution system assets are regulated assets established for the sole purpose of supplying electricity to end-users in Iloilo City. MORE avers that PECO had no more right to occupy public streets and skyline when its franchise expired, thus, PECO had the obligation to uproot, dismantle and remove its posts, wires, transformers, and electric meters from the streets and skyline of Iloilo City. The public space that they occupy are now under easement for use of MORE under its franchise. MORE posits that the cost of regulated assets have been charged to and paid for by the consumers in Iloilo City. The consumers of Iloilo City have the right to the continued use of these regulated assets to serve their basic need for electricity, as provided for under the EPIRA.\n\nFurther, MORE contends that to require it to build a new distribution system is anti-consumer and would deny the consumers of Iloilo City their right to continued service. The determination of MORE's technical competence and capability to operate the distribution system in Iloilo City is a matter within the primary jurisdiction of the ERC. Also, the matter of just compensation is an issue which must be resolved in the expropriation court.\n\nIssue\n\nThe primary issue to be resolved is whether Sections 10 and 17 of R.A. No. 11212 are constitutional.\n\nRuling of the Court\n\nAfter a careful review of the arguments raised by PECO, the Court finds no reason to depart from its Decision dated September 15, 2020.\n\nThe issues raised in the Motion for Reconsideration have been squarely and extensively discussed in the Court's Decision dated September 15, 2020. Nonetheless, the Court deems it prudent to clarity and discuss further the matters raised in the Motion.\n\n[TABLE_CONTENT]\nA franchise emanates from the constitutional power of the Legislature to grant concessions and privileges to private entities.\n[END_TABLE]\n\nA franchise emanates from the constitutional power of the Legislature to grant concessions and privileges to private entities.\n\nA franchise stated out as a \"royal privilege or (a) branch of the King's prerogative, subsisting in the hands of a subject.\" [35] This definition was given by Finch, adopted by Blackstone, and accepted by every authority since. [36] Further, \"a franchise is defined to be a special privilege to, do certain things conferred by government on an individual or corporation, and which does not belong to citizens generally of common right.\" [37] Insofar as the great powers of government are concerned, \"[a] franchise is basically a legislative grant of a special privilege to a person.\" [38] Section 11, Article XII of the 1987 Constitution further states that \"x x x for the operation of a public utility,\" no \"such franchise or right [shall] be granted except under the condition that it shall be subject to amendment, alteration, or repeal by the Congress when the common good so requires. x x x\"\n\nPursuant to this prerogative of the State, Section 27 of the EPIRA vests on Congress the power to grant franchises to persons engaged in the transmission and distribution of electricity, to wit:\n\nSection Franchising Power in the Electric Power Sector. - The power to grant franchises to persons engaged in the transmission and distribution of electricity shall be vested exclusively in the Congress of the Philippines and all laws inconsistent with this Act particularly, but not limited to, Section 43 of PD 269, otherwise known as the \"National Electrification Decree\", are hereby deemed repealed or modified accordingly: Provided, That all existing franchises shall be allowed to their full term: Provided, further, That in the case of electric cooperatives, renewals and cancellations shall remain with the National Electrification Commission under the National Electrification Administration for five (5) more years after the enactment of this Act.\n\nSince 1923 until January 18, 2019, PECO was the holder of a franchise to \"establish, operate, and maintain, for commercial purposes and in the public interest, a distribution system for the conveyance of electric power to end users in the City of Iloilo.\" [39] However, upon the expiration of PECO's franchise in 2019, Congress, exercising its constitutionally-mandated and plenary power to grant franchises, did not renew the privilege given to PECO. Instead, it awarded the franchise to MORE, as embodied in R.A. No. 11212.\n\nThe power of Congress to award the franchise to MORE is broad and plenary, subject only to limitations given by the Constitution and the fundamental principle of due process. It is beyond the power of the Court to question the wisdom of Congress in granting the franchise to MORE. The Court cannot venture into this because that would mean violating the deep-rooted principle of separation of powers. Thus, Sections 10 and 17 of R.A. No. 11212, giving MORE the power to expropriate the distribution system of PECO, are but integral parts of the grant of the franchise by Congress. Since the exercise of eminent domain is necessary to carry out the franchise, it is prudent that the Court accords respect to the legislative will.\n\n[TABLE_CONTENT]\nThe authority granted to MORE under its franchise to expropriate the existing distribution system of PECO is a valid delegation of power.\n[END_TABLE]\n\nThe authority granted to MORE under its franchise to expropriate the existing distribution system of PECO is a valid delegation of power.\n\nIn its motion for reconsideration, PECO faults the Court in allowing the expropriation of its distribution system for the same public purpose it was already devoted to. While PECO concedes that its previous legislative franchise allows expropriation of its assets and distribution system upon the termination of its franchise, it also asserts that this power may be exercised only by the government and its political subdivisions, and not by private entities such as MORE.\n\nPECO's argument fails to convince the Court.\n\nThe power of eminent domain is exercised by the Legislature. However, it may be delegated by Congress to the President, administrative bodies, local government units, and even to private enterprises performing public services . [40]\n\nThe exercise of the right to expropriate given to MORE under its franchise is a delegated authority granted by Congress. The restrictive view that expropriation may be exercised by the State alone, without any consideration for the State's authority to delegate its powers, cannot be upheld. Being a private enterprise allowed by the Congress to operate a public utility for public interest, the delegation by Congress of the power to expropriate PECO's distribution system is valid.\n\n[TABLE_CONTENT]\nThe requisites for a valid exercise of the power of eminent domain are present.\n[END_TABLE]\n\nThe requisites for a valid exercise of the power of eminent domain are present.\n\nOver the years and in a plethora of cases, this Court has recognized the following requisites for the valid exercise of the power of eminent domain: (1) the property taken must be private property; (2) there must be genuine necessity to take the private property; (3) the taking must be for public use; (4) there must be payment of just compensation; and (5) the taking must comply with due process of law. [41]\n\nIt is settled that a property already devoted to public use can still be subject to expropriation, provided this is done directly by the national legislature or under a specific grant of authority to a delegate, [42] as in the case of MORE.\n\nIn this case, PECO insists that there is no genuine public purpose served by the transfer through expropriation of its distribution system to MORE. PECO claims that the Court erroneously held that the expropriation is needed to prevent any disruption in the supply of electricity. According to PECO, as the distribution system is not burdened with public use, it can devote the same to private use, such as by disposing the system or by using it in another business. In other words, PECO zeroes in on the alleged absence of the second and third requisites for a valid exercise of the power of eminent domain.\n\nIt is established that the foundation of the right to exercise eminent domain is genuine necessity, and that necessity must be of a public character. As a rule, the determination of whether there is genuine necessity for the exercise is a justiciable question. However, when the power is exercised by the Legislature, the question of necessity is essentially a matter that the Legislature can decide and determine. Thus, in City of Manila v. Chinese Community , [43] the Court held:\n\nThe legislature, in providing for the exercise of the power of eminent domain, may directly determine the necessity for appropriating private property for a particular improvement for public use, and it may select the exact location of the improvement. In such a case, it is well-settled that the utility of the proposed improvement, the extent of the public necessity for its construction, the expediency of constructing it, the suitableness of the location selected and the consequent necessity of taking the land selected for its site, are all questions exclusively for the legislature to determine, and the courts have no power to interfere, or to substitute their own views for those of the representatives of the people. [44]\n\nAs in this case, the express authority of MORE to expropriate is embodied in R.A. No. 11212. The expropriation of the distribution system of PECO was directed by legislation.\n\nTo validly exercise the power of eminent domain, it is also required that taking should be for public use. The meaning of the term \"public use\" has evolved over time in response to changing public needs and exigencies. Public use, which was traditionally understood as strictly limited to actual \"use by the public,\" has developed an expansive meaning. \"Public use\" is now synonymous with \"public interest,\" \"public benefit,\" and \"public convenience.\" [45] At present, it may not be amiss to state that whatever is beneficially employed for the general welfare satisfies the requirement of public use. [46]\n\nIn this case, expropriation under Sections 10 and 17 of R.A. No. 11212 is for the general purpose of electricity distribution. Electricity distribution no doubt affects the public welfare. The assailed provisions ensure uninterrupted supply of electricity in the city during the transition from the old to the new franchisee. Iloilo City's public space is already burdened by PECO's existing distribution system. Yet, the distribution system cannot continue to operate under PECO's franchise as this has not been renewed by Congress.\n\nThe public necessity of ensuring uninterrupted electricity is clear in Section 10 of R.A. No. 11212 when it authorized MORE to expropriate the existing distribution system. The provision reads:\n\nSection 10. Right of Eminent Domain. \u2013 Subject to the limitations and procedures prescribed by law, the grantee is authorized to exercise the power of eminent domain insofar as it may be reasonably necessary for the efficient establishment, improvement, upgrading, rehabilitation, maintenance and operation of its services. The grantee is authorized to install and maintain its poles wires, and other facilities over, under, and across public property, including streets, highways, parks, and other similar property of the Government of the Philippines, its branches, or any of its instrumentalities. The grantee may acquire such private property as is actually necessary for the realization of the purposes for which this franchise is granted, including, but not limited to poles, wires, cables, transformers, switching equipment and stations, buildings, infrastructure, machineries and equipment previously, currently or actually used, or intended to be used, or have been abandoned, unused or underutilized, or which obstructs its facilities, for the operation of a distribution system for the conveyance of electric power to end users in its franchise area: Provided , That proper expropriation proceedings shall have been instituted and just compensation paid:\n\nProvided , further, That upon the filing of the petition tor expropriation, or at any time thereafter, and after due notice to the owner of the property to be expropriated and the deposit in a bank located in the franchise area of the full amount of the value of the property or properties, the grantee shall be entitled to immediate possession, operation, control, use and disposition of the properties sought to be expropriated, including the power of demolition, if necessary, notwithstanding the pendency of other issues before the court, including the final determination of the amount of just compensation to be paid. The court may appoint a representative from the ERC as a trial commissioner in determining the amount of just compensation. The court may consider the tax declarations, current audited financial statements, and rate-setting applications of the owner or owners of the property or properties expropriated in order to determine their assessed value.\n\nThe distinct genuine public necessity is reiterated in Section 17 thereof which allowed MORE to initiate expropriation proceedings even if PECO is provisionally operating the distribution system. Section 17 of R.A. No. 11212 states:\n\nSection 17. Transition of Operations. - In the public interest and to ensure uninterrupted supply of electricity, the current operator, Panay Electric Company, Inc. (PECO), shall in the interim be authorized to operate the existing distribution system within the franchise area, as well as implement its existing power supply agreements with generation companies that had been provisionally or finally approved by the ERC until the establishment or acquisition by the grantee of its own distribution system and complete transition towards full operations as determined by the ERC which period shall in no case exceed two (2) from the grant of this legislative franchise.\n\nUpon compliance with its rules, the ERC shall grant PECO the provisional certificate of public convenience and necessity (CPCN) covering such interim period. The applicable generation rate shall be the provisional or final rate approved by the ERC.\n\nThis provisional authority to operate during the transition period shall not be construed as extending the franchise of PECO after its expiration on January 18, 2019, and it shall not prevent the grantee from exercising the right of eminent domain over the distribution assets existing at the franchise area as provided in Section 10 of this Act. During such interim period, the ERC shall require PECO to settle the full amount which the ERC has directed to refund to its customers in connection with all the cases filed against it.\n\nTo reduce the length of the transition period, the ERC and all agencies issuing the requisite licenses shall prioritize all applications relevant to the establishment and operation of the distribution system under its franchise.\n\nThe grantee shall, as far as practicable and subject to required qualifications, accord preference to hiring former employees of PECO upon commencement of business operations.\n\nAn information dissemination campaign regarding public services and operations of the grantee shall be made to all end-users in the franchise area.\n\nThe grantee and PECO shall jointly ensure that employees not hired by the grantee shall receive all separation and/or retirement benefits they are entitled to in accordance with applicable laws. The DOE shall, during the transition, ensure that there will be uninterrupted supply of electricity in the existing franchise area.\n\nIt must be highlighted that in carrying out the obligations of MORE in its legislative franchise, time is of the essence. MORE is only given two years from the grant of the legislative franchise, or from July 23, 2018, to either establish its own distribution system or acquire the existing distribution system through the exercise of eminent domain. This is consistent with the State's objective of ensuring uninterrupted supply of electricity in the city. MORE considered it practical to exercise the power of eminent domain as there are already existing structures which would facilitate unimpeded transition from PECO to MORE.\n\nIn National Electrification Administration v. Maguindanao Electric Cooperative, Inc ., [47] the Court recognized the authority of National Electrification Administration (NEA) under Presidential Decree (PD) No. 269, to order the transfer of the distribution assets of Maguindanao Electric Cooperative, Inc. to Cotabato Electric Cooperative, Inc. the new franchise holder. Under PD No. 269, NEA had the power to acquire assets which includes the exercise of the right to eminent domain. The Court upheld NEA's right of eminent domain necessary in the pursuit of the declared policy of nationwide electrification. Notably in the said case, the transfer of distribution assets involves two private entities pursuant to the enforcement of the right to exercise eminent domain.\n\nRecently approved on August 8, 2019 is R.A. No. 11361, [48] otherwise known as the \"Anti-Obstruction of Power Lines Act,\" which recognized the policy of the State to ensure uninterrupted conveyance of electricity from generating plants to end-users. It further acknowledged that the uninterrupted conveyance of electricity is a matter of national security and is essential to sustaining the country's economic development. Section 13 of the same Act provides for the right of eminent domain granted to any person with a franchise to operate, manage, or maintain the electric power line as governed by the pertinent provisions of the Rules of Court.\n\nIn sum, expropriation by MORE of the distribution system of PECO under Sections 10 and 17 of R.A. No. 11212 serves both the general public interest of conveying power and electricity in Iloilo City and the peculiar public interest and security of ensuring the uninterrupted supply of electricity.\n\n[TABLE_CONTENT]\nThe allegation of PECO that it was singled-out and the perceived incidental benefit enjoyed by MORE do not render Sections 10 and 17 of R.A. No. 11212 unconstitutional.\n[END_TABLE]\n\nThe allegation of PECO that it was singled-out and the perceived incidental benefit enjoyed by MORE do not render Sections 10 and 17 of R.A. No. 11212 unconstitutional.\n\nContrary to the claim of PECO, it was not singled-out. There was also no undue benefit given to MORE to justify the invalidation of Sections 10 and 17 of its legislative franchise. The right to exercise eminent domain conferred by Section 10 of R.A. No. 11212 remains valid, regardless of any perceived incidental benefit to be gained or enjoyed by MORE, for as long as the requisites for the exercise of a valid expropriation was complied with. 1\n\nThere is no basis to support the claim of PECO that it has been \"singled\u00ad out\" by the approval of the franchise of MORE. There is only one franchise holder in the subject area prior to the enactment of R.A. No. 11212. It is but natural and expected that PECO, as the lone previous franchise holder which failed to secure the renewal of its franchise, will be averse to any arid all subsequent franchise holder exercising the right of eminent domain. Nonetheless, this does not mean that PECO can simply ask the nullification of the legislative franchise awarded to MORE for being \"singled-out.\"\n\nIt must be emphasized that a legislative franchise is merely a privilege and not a right that may be demanded by any individual or entity. The Court cannot substitute the judgment of the Congress with its own with respect to the determination of which entity it deems most qualified to carry out the distribution of electricity in Iloilo City. It must be remembered that the Constitution has delineated separate and quite distinct roles that each branch of government must fill. In the exercise of judicial review, the Court is limited to the determination of the constitutionality of R.A. No. 11212. The Court does not possess the technical knowledge required in the field of power distribution to competently evaluate the capacity of MORE to carry out its functions under R.A. No. 11212. Resolving whether PECO deserves to be granted an extension or renewal of its franchise and whether MORE is qualified as a new franchisee are matters clearly beyond the ambit or the Court's authority to review as these are purely matters left to the wisdom of Congress.\n\nLikewise, the incidental benefit enjoyed by MORE does not render its legislative franchise unconstitutional. As fittingly explained by Associate Justice Alfredo Benjamin S. Caguioa in his Separate Opinion, [49]\n\nx x x [W]hile the exercise of the power of eminent domain over the electric power distribution facilities of PECO may garner benefits in favor of MORE, this would be but incidental. Notably, its duties as a public utility would nonetheless remain regulated by the government. At the end of the day, at the proper expropriation proceedings instituted for the purpose, the abiding reality would be for the court to be satisfied with evidence proffered by MORE \u2013 that its intended taking would invariably be for the good of the public, is actually necessary, and that there is just compensation therefor. [50]\n\nIt is important to highlight that the incidental private benefit MORE enjoys does not override the paramount public interest on which the right of eminent domain is hinged. It would be unfair for the public to be deprived of access to uninterrupted supply of electricity, an important tool to economic growth, simply because of some incidental benefit MORE may gain from its legislative franchise.\n\nMoreover, as aptly pointed out by Senior Associate Justice Estela Perlas-Bernabe in her Separate Opinion, [51] MORE is not the only entity engaged in the business of distribution utilities accorded with a similar authority to exercise eminent domain embedded in a legislative franchise. The respective legislative franchises of the following entities contain a similar provision: (1) Cotabato Electric Cooperative, Inc.\u2013PPALMA (under R.A. No. 11322); (2) Cotabato Light and Power Company (under R.A. No. 10637); (3) First Bay Power Corp. (under R.A. No. 10891); (4) Angeles Electric Corporation (under R.A. No. 9381); and (5) Olongapo Electricity Distribution Company, Inc. (under R.A. No. 10373). [52]\n\nIt is erroneous for PECO to argue that only the State and its subdivisions or the local government units may exercise the power of eminent domain. Noticeably, these franchise holders are cooperatives and private corporations. Therefore, it cannot simply be concluded that the Congress, in enacting R.A. No. 11212, extended favorable concessions to MORE to the exclusion of all other distribution utilities because other private entities such as the cooperatives and private corporations mentioned enjoy similar privileges.\n\nIt is also worthy to point out that MORE is under a unique circumstance and is faced with an unusual obstacle. It is mandated to assume the operations of PECO, whose facilities are already existing and occupied by its employees, while simultaneously ensuring that the distribution of electricity to various areas in Iloilo City remain uninterrupted during the interim period. Though not impossible to accomplish, the Congress deemed it prudent to confer the power provided in Sections 10 and 17 of R.A. No. 11212 to guaranty that the transition phase will not hamper the duty of the franchisee to supply electric power, an essential necessity in the lives of people residing in Iloilo City. The Court, speaking through the ponencia of Associate Justice Jose C. Reyes, Jr., explained that:\n\nMORE is a new franchise holder that is virtually deprived of the option to set up a new distribution system, not only because the existing public space is burdened with the distribution system of the old franchise holder, but also because it must hit the ground running and ensure the uninterrupted and continuous supply of electricity to the city. MORE is therefore peculiarly and doubly burdened. It must not only supply electricity, it must also prevent any disruption that might arise from its takeover of the franchise. [53]\n\nClearly, in granting MORE the right to exercise eminent domain, the primordial concern of the Congress is the welfare of the residents of Iloilo City who rely on the distribution system of PECO. There is no question that PECO's franchise was not renewed, thus, it can no longer operate the distribution system in Iloilo City. MORE, as the new franchisee, is mandated under Section 2 of R.A. No. 11212 to operate and maintain the distribution system in the best manner possible. To be able to do so, its right to expropriate the distribution system in Iloilo City to ensure uninterrupted supply of electricity should not be hampered by unfounded allegations of undue benefit and corporate takeover. In the end, the net public benefit generated from the exercise of the right of eminent domain outweighs any and all incidental and secondary benefit any private entity, including MORE, may acquire. In view of the foregoing, the constitutionality of Sections 10 and 17 of R.A. No. 11212 must be upheld.\n\nWHEREFORE , the Motion for Reconsideration is DENIED .\n\nSO ORDERED.\n\nPeralta, C.J., Perlas-Bernabe, Caguioa, Gesmundo, Hernando, Rosario , and Lopez, JJ ., concur.\nLeonen and Lazaro-Javier, JJ ., dissent.

[1] Sections 10 [2] and 17 [3] of Republic Act No. 11212 are unconstitutional. They violate the equal protection clause, granting electricity franchise to a corporation strikingly inexperienced in supplying electricity. The provisions unduly discriminate against other public utilities, especially the former electric utility operating in Iloilo City, as well as those similarly situated to the new franchisee but, for reasons unclear, were not given the same concessions.\n\nWorse, the private property taken is not for public use. All that Sections 10 and 17 allow is a transfer of property from one private corporation to another for the same public purpose to which it was originally devoted. The inefficient monopolistic operation of the electric utility in Iloilo city remains, with no real improvement. In reality, the taking here only serves private interests, and whatever benefit the public gets is only incidental.\n\nThe Motion for Reconsideration should therefore be granted and the Decision of the Mandaluyong trial court affirmed.\n\nI\n\nWhile broad and plenary, [4] as the majority states, the power of Congress to grant franchises for the operation of a public utility is always subject to the provisions of the Constitution. The foremost limitation is provided in Section 1 of the Bill of Rights: \"no person shall be deprived of life, liberty, or property without due process of law, nor shall any person be denied the equal protection of the laws.\"\n\nIn my September 15, 2020 Dissent, I outlined how Section 10 of Republic Act No. 11212 violates the equal protection clause. The right of eminent domain delegated to More Electric Power Corporation (More Electric) constitutes class legislation\u2014a law that discriminates against some but favors others. [5] Reading Section 10 in isolation will not lead to this conclusion. However, when read in conjunction with the eminent domain provisions of other electricity franchises, the unwarranted benefits granted to More Electric becomes apparent.\n\nSection 10 of Republic Act No. 11212 provides:\n\nSECTION 10. Right of Eminent Domain . \u2014 Subject to the limitations and procedures prescribed by law, the grantee is authorized to exercise the power of eminent domain insofar as it may be reasonably necessary for the efficient establishment, improvement, upgrading, rehabilitation, maintenance and operation of its services. The grantee is authorized to install and maintain its poles wires, and other facilities over, under, and across public property, including streets, highways, parks, and other similar property of the Government of the Philippines, its branches, or any of its instrumentalities. The grantee may acquire such private property as is actually necessary for the realization of the purposes for which this franchise is granted, including, but not limited to poles, wires, cables, transformers, switching equipment and stations, buildings, infrastructure, machineries and equipment previously, currently or actually used, or intended to be used, or have been abandoned, unused or underutilized, or which obstructs its facilities, for the operation of a distribution system for the conveyance of electric power to end users in its franchise area: Provided, That proper expropriation proceedings shall have been instituted and just compensation paid:\n\nProvided, further, That upon the filing of the petition for expropriation, or at any time thereafter, and after due notice to the owner of the property to be expropriated and the deposit in a bank located in the franchise area of the full amount of the assessed value of the property or properties, the grantee shall be entitled to immediate possession, operation, control, use and disposition of the properties sought to be expropriated, including the power of demolition, if necessary, notwithstanding the pendency of other issues before the court, including the final determination of the amount of just compensation to be paid. The court may appoint a representative from the ERC as a trial commissioner in determining the amount of just compensation. The court may consider the tax declarations, current audited financial statements, and rate-setting applications of the owner or owners of the property or properties being expropriated in order to determine their assessed value. (Emphasis supplied)\n\nOn the other hand, the eminent domain provision in Panay Electric Company, Inc.'s (Panay Electric) expired franchise states:\n\nSECTION 4. It is expressly provided that in the event the Government should desire to operate and maintain for itself the system and enterprise herein authorized, the grantee shall surrender its franchise and will turn over to the government all equipment therein at fair market value.\n\nAs can be gleaned from the provisions, More Electric may exercise its delegated power of eminent domain over properties \"previously, currently or actually used . . . for the operation of a distribution system for the conveyance of electric power to end users\" in Iloilo City. These properties are no other than those used by the former electric utility, Panay Electric. Further, Section 10 allows More Electric to expropriate the properties of Panay Electric by mere payment of the full amount of their assessed value.\n\nThis is in contrast to Section 4 of Republic Act No. 5360, Panay Electric's expired franchise, which allows the government itself: not a mere delegate like More Electric, to exercise its power of eminent domain upon payment of fair market value. Assessed value being a mere percentage of the fair market value, [6] it is clear that Section 10 allows More Electric to exercise its delegated eminent domain powers by paying a significantly lower amount compared to what the government would have paid had it expropriated the properties of Panay Electric. This difference in the payable amount is a clear benefit to More Electric.\n\nThis difference is highlighted further by comparing Section 10 of Republic Act No. 11212 with the eminent domain provisions found in legislative franchises of other electric utilities.\n\n[TABLE_CONTENT]\nMore Electric and Power Corporation [Republic Act No. 11212 (2018)] | Mactan Electric Company, Inc.

No provisions similar to Section 17 can be found in the legislative franchises of other electric utilities.\n\nThese differences matter because More Electric has no experience in the business of supplying electricity. To be an allowable discrimination under the equal protection clause, the discrimination must, at the very least, be reasonable. [8] Indulging a corporation with all of these benefits, when it has no expertise in the business it seeks to operate, cannot be reasonable. This unreasonableness is more glaring considering that the supply of electricity is a business imbued with public interest.\n\nII\n\nMoreover, Section 10 of Republic Act No. 11212 violates Article III, Section 9 of the Constitution as it allows the taking of private property not for public use.\n\nThe definition of \"public use\" has evolved from the literal \"actual use by the public\" to \"public purpose,\" [9] \"'public advantage or benefit,\" [10] and \"public welfare.\" [11] Admittedly, the supply of electricity is one for public advantage and benefit.\n\nNevertheless, if property is taken for the same public use to which it was originally devoted, there is no true expropriation. As early as 1921, this Court in Se\u00f1a v. Manila Railroad Co. and Insular Government [12] noted how \"the meaning of the term 'public use' [is] one of constant growth\" [13] and that \"[a]s society advances, its demands upon the individual increase and e ach demand is a new use to which the resources of the individual may be devoted .\" [14] This implies that a true expropriation requires a new a public use.\n\nThus, if property is taken then subsequently devoted to the same public use, there is only a transfer of property from one entity to another. All the exercise of eminent domain results in is a change as to who the profits. [15] Therefore, the taking primarily serves proprietary interests, with little to no regard to the interests of the public. Any public interest is only a pretense or incidental at best.\n\nMore Electric seeks to expropriate the properties of Panay Electric for the continued and uninterrupted supply of electricity in Iloilo City. This is the exact same public use to which Panay Electric devoted its properties.\n\nIt must be emphasized that More Electric has no experience in electricity distribution and has no assets of its own to distribute electricity in Iloilo City . The electricity distribution system, even the workforce that would be operating the system, will be the same. All this case involves is a forced transfer of properties from Panay Electric to More Electric. The taking is not for public use but in the service of proprietary interests.\n\nThe majority concludes with this: \"in granting MORE the right to exercise eminent domain, the primordial concern of the Congress is the welfare of the residents of Iloilo City.\" [16] I cannot see this. All I see is a law giving a semblance of legitimacy to what actually is an abuse of the expropriation powers of the State.\n\nI therefore dissent.\n\nIN VIEW OF THE FOREGOING , I vote to GRANT the Motion for Reconsideration and AFFIRM the July 1, 2019 Judgment of the Regional Trial Court, Branch 209, Mandaluyong City in Civil Case No. R\u00adMND-1900571.\n\n[1] Dissenting Opinion of J.

The attainted person is PECO.\n\nPECO is singled out . It is expressly identified as the wrongdoer . Upon it, legislative punishment as this was historically understood has been imposed. As well, the non-punitive legislative purpose has been far outweighed by the legislative intent to punish and the legislative punishment accordingly exacted . As clearly and succinctly recounted in the congressional deliberations , the non-punitive legislative purpose arose only from and was the result only of the punishment Sections 10 and 17 have envisioned to inflict.\n\nThe punishment is the legislative determination of what otherwise would have been a judicial function of the propriety of confiscating or expropriating PECO's properties resulting from the non-renewal of PECO's franchise and the propriety of allowing such confiscation or expropriation to favor the new franchise holder, MORE.\n\nSecond . Sections 10 and 17 violate the equal protection of the laws . They have been tailored to target and single out PECO and its properties. Sections 10 and 17 apply to no other entity but PECO and its facilities. Biraogo v. The Philippine Truth Commission of 2010 [1] supports my claim. Third .

Essence of a bill of attainder\n\nBills of attainder have often been associated with criminal statutes. There is however no reason not to use the proscription against them to civil statutes that mirror what bills of attainder do in the criminal setting. Functionally and traditionally, bills of attainder as well as ex post facto laws have been invoked to nullify civil statutes or regulations. [2]\n\nThe essence of a bill of attainder is the substitution of a legislative for a judicial determination of the legitimacy of a deprivation . The constitutional ban against bills of attainder serves to implement the principle of separation of powers by confining legislatures to rule-making and thereby forestalling legislative usurpation of the judicial function .\n\nHistory in perspective, bills of attainder were employed to suppress government takings of life or property involving unpopular causes and political minorities , and it is against this evil that the constitutional prohibition is directed. Thus:\n\nON reviewing the U.S. Constitution, it is easy to assume that the document contained no takings protection language prior to the addition of the Fifth Amendment , as part of the Bill of Rights. In reality, however, a takings protection was inserted directly into the body of the Constitution in 1787. This was the ban on bills of attainder , found in Article I, Sections 9 and 10. A bill of attainder is an egregious taking of life or property by an arbitrary legislative act, and the ban on bills of attainder was primarily meant to protect the people from such arbitrary takings by the government. During the antebellum period, construing the ban on bills of attainder as a takings protection was well known, and lawyers and judges frequently referred to this ban. It was only after the Civil War that this commonly understood takings protection faded gradually into disuse, primarily because of the Fourteenth Amendment's incorporation doctrine. Today, this protection is all but forgotten.\n\nRecognizing the ban on bills of attainder as a takings protection greatly aids in understanding several constitutional issues that have otherwise not been fully understood. For example, seeing the ban on bills of attainder as a takings protection helps in understanding why the Eleventh Amendment's passage was in large measure a reaction to potential attainder lawsuits against the states. We also better understand why the ban on ex post facto laws only needed to apply to criminal matters, and more clearly see how takings law/attainders were a driving force for separating governmental powers, particularly between the legislature and the judiciary . Finally, we can better understand why many of the founders - particularly James Madison - so greatly feared factions as the greatest threat to the new republic. In short, the ban on bills of attainder illuminates the early workings of the new constitutional republic in America.\n\nThis article mostly draws from the founders' comments at the Constitutional Convention and the antebellum case law that treats the ban on bills of attainder as a takings protection. The jurists' and practitioners' statements in these early cases - including comments from such luminaries as John Marshall and Daniel Webster - demonstrate their understanding of the ban on bills of attainder as a takings protection, independent of the Fifth Amendment or any other state takings language. Likewise, their statements about the ban on bills of attainder clarify the other constitutional doctrines discussed in this article.\n\nEven though the antebellum era has long since passed, the concept that the ban on bills of attainder is a takings protection and its clarification of other constitutional doctrines has value for us today. There is no compelling reason why the antebellum understanding of bills of attainder is any less legitimate now than back then. To be sure, the Fifth Amendment protections now apply to state takings due to the Fourteenth Amendment's incorporation doctrine. But this application in no way negates the ongoing potential effectiveness of using the ban on bills of attainder in the Constitution as a takings protection. Indeed, there will be times that the ban on bills of attainder will be a better fit for a particular judicial problem than the Fifth or Fourteenth Amendments. Examples could include legislation targeting unpopular groups or groups holding property which the government wants. Accordingly, courts today should consider applying this provision of the Constitution as a takings protection, just as the courts formerly did. If they do, the courts will discover that it will not only serve to protect the innocent from arbitrary takings, but that it will also help clarify constitutional doctrines today as it did in former times. Indeed, this is one of the greatest benefits that can come from using the ban on bills of attainder as a takings protection, since many constitutional doctrines today are often confused and misunderstood. [3]\n\nThe provision against bills of attainder came about in this historical factual context - the American revolutionary war needed funding and legislation provided that funding by taking the property of named persons as wrongdoers . [4] The drafters of the American Constitution were aware that these legislations were \"arbitrary and represented a dangerous power of government to take land , and wanted to ensure that such wholesale takings did not occur in the future. Hence, the Constitutional Convention adopted the ban on bills of attainder without dissent.\" [5]\n\nThe protection against bills of attainder primarily protected property rights , which had been greatly abused by such wartime enactments. [6] Individuals needed to be protected from egregious takings by the state \u2013 this protection was the ban on bills of attainder , which \"restricted all legislative takings failing to meet the standards of due process, compensation, and public use.\" [7] This protection was conceived to be a judicial one, a protection coming from the courts . [8]\n\nIn the United States of America, bills of attainder, including bills of pains and penalties, are constitutionally prohibited under Article I, Sections 9 and 10 of its Constitution .\n\nB. Elements of a Bill of Attainder\n\nThe elements of a bill of attainder are: (i) the singling out of a definite class, (ii) the imposition of a burden on it, without or far outweighing any non-punitive legislative purpose , and a legislative intent to do so , and (iii) the lack of judicial trial . [9] These elements stigmatize statute or any of its provisions as a bill of attainder .\n\n[TABLE_CONTENT]\ni. | Singling out of a definite class\n[END_TABLE]\n\ni. Singling out of a definite class\n\nIf the statute sets forth a generally applicable rule decreeing that any person who commits certain acts or possesses certain characteristics shall not enjoy a right or a privilege, and leaves to courts the task of deciding what persons have committed the specified acts or possessed the specified characteristics, the statute is valid .\n\nBut if the statute designates in no uncertain terms the persons who possess the feared characteristics and therefore cannot enjoy the right or privilege , for example, members of the Communist Party, or here, respondent PECO, the legislative act , no matter what its form , that applies either to named individuals or easily ascertainable members of a group in such a way as to deprive these individuals or groups of any right , civil or political, without judicial trial , is a bill of attainder prohibited by the Constitution.\n\n[TABLE_CONTENT]\nii. | Imposition of a burden, without or far outweighing any non-punitive legislative purpose, and a legislative intent to do so\n[END_TABLE]\n\nii. Imposition of a burden, without or far outweighing any non-punitive legislative purpose, and a legislative intent to do so\n\nIn Cummings v. Missouri , [10] the United States Supreme Court held that depriving or confiscating one's property has been understood historically as punishment .\n\nPresently, in the United States, there is no longer a requirement for the legislature to convict a person of a specified crime or to inflict the historical punishments of pain and/or death in order for a statute to constitute a bill of attainder. American law has never precluded the possibility that new burdens and deprivations might be legislatively fashioned that are inconsistent with the bill of attainder guarantee; there is as well no more need for the offending statute to include any formal legislative pronouncement of moral blameworthiness or formal intent to punish the targeted individual, group, or corporation . [11] The question is whether the legislation has a punitive objective or a legitimate, non-punitive, legislative purpose . Where such legitimate legislative purposes do not appear or are far out-weighed by an intention to cause deprivation , it is reasonable to conclude that punishment of individuals disadvantaged by the enactment was the purpose of the decision makers. [12]\n\nConsolidated Edison Co. of N.Y., Inc. v. Pataki [13] held that \"[w]here such legitimate legislative purposes do not appear,\" it is already \"reasonable to conclude that punishment of individuals disadvantaged by the enactment was the purpose of the decision makers,\" there are nonetheless several other tests set out in American jurisprudence for determining whether a statute is punitive or non-punitive . Therefore, if one follows American jurisprudence, one must also consider whether the provision could still be construed as amounting to a legislative determination of guilt and punishment.\n\nIn Consolidated Edison Co. of N.Y., Inc. , a public utility wished to pass on the costs of a power outage to the consumers. A replacement generator had been purchased fifteen (15) years prior to the outage, but was not installed until the defective generator finally failed. A prior agreement was in place whereby Consolidated Edison could pass certain costs on to its ratepayers in the form of temporary rate increases subject to statutory review by the New York Public Service Commission. The Assembly and Senate, however passed a bill without amendment, thus:\n\n\u00a71. ...By continuing to operate steam generators known to be defective, and thereby increasing the risk of a radioactive release and/or an expensive plant outage, the Consolidated Edison Company failed to exercise reasonable care on behalf of the health, safety and economic interests of his customers. Therefore it would not be in the public interest for the company to recover from ratepayers any costs resulting from the February 15, 2000 outage at the Indian Point 2 Nuclear Facility.\n\nThe prohibition on recovering the cost extended to base rates \"or any other rate recovery mechanism.\"\n\nThe appellate court stated that an indispensable element of a bill of attainder is the fact that it defines past conduct as wrongdoing and then imposes punishment on that past conduct . The court considered three (3) factors in determining whether the statute was punitive :\n\n(1) whether it fell within the historical meaning of legislative punishment ,\n\n(2) whether, viewed in terms of the type and severity of burdens imposed , it could reasonably be said to further non-punitive legislative purposes, and\n\n(3) whether it evinced an intent to punish .\n\nThe court focused on the last two (2) criteria, finding that eliminating harm to innocent third parties is a purpose consistent with punishment , and that general and specific deterrence are traditional justifications for punishment . The court determined that a quite substantial proportion of the costs in question could have been passed on unchallenged in a routine generator replacement. Nothing but punishment could justify preventing Consolidated Edison from passing these costs on to ratepayers. The court also found that the legislative history clearly evinced an intent to punish .\n\nConsolidated Edison is also remarkable in the clearly punitive intentions voiced by the legislators themselves and the inference which can be drawn from the language of the provision itself. Clearly, the court in that case was of the view that the legislature had concluded that the act of the public utility in failing to replace the generator was worthy of sanction , and viewed the legislation as imposing that sanction .\n\nUnited States v. Lovett , [14] concerned a provision which decreed that no salary or other compensation was to be paid to certain employees of the Government, specified by name , unless they were again appointed by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate. The individuals in question allegedly had communist leanings. The court found that the purpose of the legislation was permanently to bar those individuals from government service because of what Congress thought about their political beliefs . The court further stated that the provision achieved the same purpose as would a statute which designated the conduct as criminal . The court, too, rejected the argument that the section did not provide for the dismissal of the individuals, but merely forbade governmental agencies to compensate them for any work.\n\nLovett is notable because the subjects of the provision were singled out from other government employees because of their political views , and were publicly blacklisted . There was sufficient evidence to conclude that the legislative intention was to punish the subjects for their beliefs and to make an example of them in order to deter others .\n\nIn the same vein, Acorn v. United States mentioned that the element of punishment involved the consideration of three (3) interdependent factors :\n\n(1) whether the challenged statute falls within the historical meaning of legislative punishment ( historical test of punishment ); (2) whether the statute, \"viewed in terms of the type and severity of burdens imposed, reasonably can be said to further nonpunitive legislative purposes \" ( functional test of punishment ); and (3) whether the legislative record \"evinces a [legislative] intent to punish\" ( motivational test of punishment ). Selective Serv. Sys., 468 U.S. at 852, 104 S.Ct. 3348. All three factors need not be satisfied to prove that a law constitutes \"punishment;\" rather, \"th[e] factors are the evidence that is weighed together in resolving a bill of attainder claim.\" Con. Edison, 292 F.3d at 350.\n\nAccording to Acorn , \"the Supreme Court has recognized that certain types of punishment are 'so disproportionately severe and so inappropriate to nonpunitive ends that they unquestionably have been held to fall within the proscription of the [Bill of Attainder Clause]'.\" Confiscation of one's property is one that has long been recognized as a type of punishment.\n\nThe functional test of punishment looks at the type and severity of the burdens imposed . Essentially, it answers the question , what will happen to the attainted entity, will it close shop and eventually be driven out of any business whatsoever and into bankruptcy? Thus:\n\n\"A grave imbalance or disproportion between the burden and the purported nonpunitive purpose suggests punitiveness, even where the statute bears some minimal relation to nonpunitive ends.\" Id.; accord Con. Edison, 292 F.3d at 350 (\"Where a statute establishing a punishment declares and imposes that punishment on an identifiable party ... we look beyond simply a rational relationship of the statute to a legitimate public purpose for less burdensome alternatives by which the legislature could have achieved its legitimate nonpunitive objectives .\"\n\nThe motivational test of punishment examines the intent of the legislators in enacting the statute - upon the legislature's determination that the attainted entity was guilty of abusive and fraudulent practices. This test looks for the declaration of guilt of the attainted entity by the legislature during its deliberations or in the statute itself and a congressional trial to determine such guilt . The standard of proof is clear legislative intent to punish .\n\nTo summarize, the test of punishment involves two (2) steps. First , identify if the legislation looks at past conduct as a wrongdoing . Second , determine if the legislation imposes burdens or deprivations on that past conduct . To complete the second step in the test, consider the three (3) factors in resolving whether the statute is punitive : (a) whether it fell within the historical meaning of legislative punishment , (b) whether, viewed in terms of the type and severity of burdens imposed , it could reasonably be said to further non-punitive legislative purposes, and (c) whether it evinced an intent to punish .\n\nLastly, in Cummings v. Missouri , [15] it was held that a legislation is nonetheless a bill of attainder even if the persons or entities are singled out and punished only indirectly , that is, the punishment does not directly follow from the ascription of wrongdoing in the legislation. Thus:\n\nIf the clauses of the second article of the constitution of Missouri, to which we have referred, had in terms declared that Mr. Cummings was guilty , or should be held guilty, of having been in armed hostility to the United States, or of having entered that State to avoid being enrolled or drafted into the military service of the United States, and, therefore, should be deprived of the right to preach as a priest of the Catholic Church, or to teach in any institution of learning, there could be no question that the clauses would constitute a bill of attainder within the meaning of the Federal Constitution. If these clauses , instead of mentioning his name, had declared that all priests and clergymen within the State of Missouri were guilty of these acts, or should be held guilty of them, and hence be subjected to the like deprivation, the clauses would be equally open to objection . And, further, if these clauses had declared that all such priests and clergymen should be so held guilty, and be thus deprived, provided they did not , by a day designated, do certain specified acts, they would be no less within the inhibition of the Federal Constitution.\n\nIn all these cases there would be the legislative enactment creating the deprivation without any of the ordinary forms and guards provided for the security of the citizen in the administration of justice by the established tribunals.\n\nThe results which would follow from clauses of the character mentioned do follow from the clauses actually adopted. The difference between the last case supposed and the case actually presented is one of form only, and not of substance.\n\nThe existing clauses presume the guilt of the priests and clergymen, and adjudge the deprivation of their right to preach or teach unless the presumption be first removed by their expurgatory oath \u2013 in other words, they assume the guilt and adjudge the punishment conditionally . The clauses supposed differ only in that they declare the guilt instead of assuming it . The deprivation is effected with equal certainty in the one case as it would be in the other, but not with equal directness. The purpose of the lawmaker in the case supposed would be openly avowed; in the case existing it is only disguised. The legal result must be the same, for what cannot be done directly cannot be done indirectly. The Constitution deals with substance, not shadows. Its inhibition was levelled at the thing, not the name. It intended that the rights of the citizen should be secure against deprivation for past conduct by legislative enactment, under any form, however disguised . If the inhibition can be evaded by the form of the enactment, its insertion in the fundamental law was a vain and futile proceeding.\n\n[TABLE_CONTENT]\niii. | Lack of judicial trial\n[END_TABLE]\n\niii. Lack of judicial trial\n\nTo illustrate, the proper procedure for the taking of private property and the improper manner of doing it have been spelled out , as follows:\n\nIf a legislature or state agency wants to take property, the proper procedure entails designating the property to be taken, filing a lawsuit identifying the property and its owners , and allowing the owners to contest the compensation that the legislature or state agency offers. This procedure essentially refers the consummation of the taking to the judiciary . This process happens all the time today and is relatively well understood. Other than the initial designation of land to be taken, the entire procedure takes place in the judicial branch .\n\nA bill of attainder seeks to bypass this procedure. It identifies the property to be taken , and then brazenly takes it , frequently with the excuse that the legislature is merely punishing an unworthy individual or group . No meaningful procedure is allowed for protest, and compensation is ignored. A structural check on legislative aggrandizement is the very heart and soul of the ban on bills of attainder and the essence of the separation of powers. As Justice Chase said in Calder v. Bull :\n\nThese acts [of attainder] were legislative judgments ; and an exercise of judicial power . . . The ground for the exercise of such legislative power was this, that the safety of the kingdom depended on the death, or other punishment, of the offender : as traitors, when discovered, could be so formidable, or the government so insecure! With very few exceptions, the advocates of such laws were stimulated by ambition, or personal resentment, and vindictive malice. To prevent such, and similar, acts of violence and injustice, I believe, the Federal and State Legislatures, were prohibited from passing any bill of attainder.\n\nJustice Chase's articulation corresponded with the understanding of his fellow jurists and practitioners during the antebellum period. Attorneys making arguments to the courts during this time often identified t he ban on bills of attainder as a legislative intrusion into the judicial sphere , and as a takings protection .\n\nC. Application of the Bill of Attainder test to Sections 10 and 17 of RA 11212\n\nHere, we have exactly in the assailed provisions the objectionable bills of attainder.\n\nFirst, the language of Sections 10 and 17 and legislative history of RA 11212 single out PECO as a wrongdoer for the confiscation of its properties by MORE for the latter's take-over and immediate benefit and use, despite the availability of other means and properties for this purpose and bypassing existing regulations that address concerns about allegedly mismanaged organizations .\n\nSecond, through Sections 10 and 17 and its deliberations, Congress has already determined:\n\n[TABLE_CONTENT]\n(i) | the existence of all the elements justifying the expropriation of PECO's propertiesbyMORE,\n(ii) | as wellas the propriety of MORE's take-overandimmediate use of and benefit from these properties,\n[END_TABLE]\n\n(i) the existence of all the elements justifying the expropriation of PECO's properties by MORE, (ii) as well as the propriety of MORE's take-over and immediate use of and benefit from these properties,\n\nand thus, has made the judicial proceedings for expropriation by MORE against PECO a mere ceremonial procedure.\n\nThird, the legislative confiscation of PECO's properties for MORE's take-over and immediate benefit and use is the punishment for PECO's alleged wrongdoings , which in turn is a direct outcome of the non-renewal of its franchise and the award of the franchise to MORE .\n\nFourth, the non-punitive legislative purpose for the legislative confiscation of PECO's properties for MORE's take-over, benefit and use is far-outweighed by the legislative intent to deprive PECO of its properties.\n\nFor one , the public purpose for the confiscation arose solely from the utter inability of MORE as the new franchise holder to provide the facilities and technical knowhow to establish, operate, and maintain its franchise requirements .\n\nBut for this utter inability of MORE, there would have been NO non-punitive legislative purpose for the legislative confiscation of PECO's properties for MORE's take-over, benefit, and use . The non-punitive legislative purpose was a created or manufactured need when Congress allowed a non-equipped and ill-prepared entity to take-over the franchise and authorized a business plan that plainly revolved around the take-over of the existing franchise holder's properties.\n\nAs a result, it is reasonable to conclude that the punishment of PECO as the entity disadvantaged by RA 11212 is the legislation's only preponderant purpose. [16]\n\nEqually important , the condemnation of PECO's properties lock, stock, and barrel , is clearly overbroad in relation to the purported legitimate purpose of RA 11212 as it unnecessarily precludes PECO from using its properties for other business purposes.\n\nFifth , the congressional deliberations on the precursors of RA 11212 make it crystal clear that Sections 10 and 17 exhibit all the elements of a bill of attainder.\n\n[TABLE_CONTENT]\nThe language of Sections 10 and 17 and legislative history of RA 11212single out PECOas awrongdoerfor theconfiscationof its properties byMOREfor the latter'stake-overandimmediate benefit and use.\n[END_TABLE]\n\nThe language of Sections 10 and 17 and legislative history of RA 11212 single out PECO as a wrongdoer for the confiscation of its properties by MORE for the latter's take-over and immediate benefit and use.\n\nThe Explanatory Note for the precursor of RA 11212, House Bill No. 8132, identifies PECO as a wrongdoer in this manner:\n\nThe quality of service of PECO has been wanting . Among the complaints against PECO are: overbilling/overcharging, arrogant personnel/poor customer relations, distributor related outages, inadequately maintained lines, inadequate investment in distribution facilities, and inordinate delay in the restoration of power services, among others.\n\nSection 10 refers to the institution of expropriation proceedings and does not expressly identify PECO as the object of the confiscation. That PECO however is the object of Section 10 is clarified by Section 17 when it referred to PECO and its facilities. Besides, Section 10's reference to MORE's franchise area means no other than PECO and its properties.\n\nQuoted below extensively, the deliberations on RA 11212 make it clear as day that PECO's properties are the object of the legislated confiscation for MORE's take-over and immediate benefit and use .\n\nOf late, Senator William Gatchalian's statements have confirmed the singling out of franchise holders for the imposition of penalties against them for alleged past infractions . He was quoted to have said:\n\nIn fact, he said, any legislator could seek a review of Meralco's franchise as part of Congress' oversight authority even before the power distributor could apply for an extension.\n\n\"Based on our experience with ABS-CBN, the sins of the past can come and haunt you. In other words, during the deliberations of its franchise, this type of violation can be a basis for the revocation or non-extension of (Meralco's) franchise,\" Gatchalian said.\n\n\"This could be a 'bad record' against (Meralco) ... It could be a hindrance (for securing a new franchise),\" he cautioned. [17]\n\n[TABLE_CONTENT]\nThrough Sections 10 and 17 and its deliberations, Congress hasalready determined:\n | \n(i) | the existence of all the elements justifying the expropriation of PECO's propertiesbyMORE,\n(ii) | as well asthe propriety of MORE's take-overandimmediate use of and benefit from these properties,\n | \nand thus, hasmade the judicial proceedings for expropriationby MORE against PECO amere ceremonial procedure.\n[END_TABLE]\n\nThrough Sections 10 and 17 and its deliberations, Congress has already determined:\n\n(i) the existence of all the elements justifying the expropriation of PECO's properties by MORE, (ii) as well as the propriety of MORE's take-over and immediate use of and benefit from these properties,\n\nand thus, has made the judicial proceedings for expropriation by MORE against PECO a mere ceremonial procedure.\n\nThe texts of Sections 10 and 17, together with the deliberations on these provisions, have already decreed the presence of all the elements for the valid expropriation of PECO's properties .\n\nCongress has said that there is public use for the confiscation lock, stock and barrel of PECO's properties. The ponencia echoes this legislative determination. This contradicts the doctrine that the determination of whether a given use is a public use is a judicial function . [18]\n\nThis legislative determination disregards the crucial fact that the public use would NOT have come about, or would not have arisen or not have been created, but for the l egislatively endorsed business plan of MORE as the new franchise holder simply to take over PECO's properties as it did not have the facilities to establish, operate , and maintain its franchise.\n\nWould this type of public use legitimately fall within the rubric of public use for eminent domain purposes, when public use was brought about by bringing in a new franchise holder that can discharge the franchise only by taking over the assets of the immediately preceding franchise holder? The fact is that the courts have been boxed in and painted into a corner to acknowledge and affirm this type of public use because of the urgency to provide continuity in the provision of electricity to the people in the franchise area.\n\nSo far as the element of public use is concerned, the courts can no longer decide otherwise when Congress has resolved the presence of this element. The court proceedings for expropriation have become a fait accompli with the outcome already decided by legislative fiat .\n\nThe next element already resolved by Congress to exist is genuine public necessity . Section 10 expressly mentions that the taking of PECO's properties is actually necessary for the establishment, operation, and maintenance of MORE's franchise.\n\nSection 10 lists PECO's \" poles, wires, cables, transformers, switching equipment and stations, buildings, infrastructure, machineries and equipment ,\" as being actually necessary for the alleged public use the franchise is supposed to realize. Section 17 reinforces this determination of genuine public necessity when it mentions PECO and authorizes the expropriation of properties within the franchise area that are actually necessary for the franchise, namely, those mentioned in Section 10.\n\nSo did the congressional deliberations quoted below, which confirmed that the only way for MORE to establish, operate , and maintain its franchise is for it to take over PECO's properties .\n\nWhat is problematic about Section 10 and Section 17 is the preclusion of any debate on the genuine public necessity of expropriating PECO's \" poles, wires, cables, transformers, switching equipment and stations, buildings, infrastructure, machineries and equipment .\" Section 10 is categorical \u2013 it mentions the foregoing properties as examples of those properties that are \" actually necessary for the realization of the purposes for which this franchise is granted.\" Section 10 and Section 17 forestall a judicial determination as to the genuine public necessity for the taking of these properties.\n\nIn Vanhorne's Lessee v. Dorrance , [19] the public necessity warranting the transfer of properties from one private owner to another private owner, as in the present case, must be nothing short of \" urgent cases , or cases of the first necessity .\" This type of condemnation cannot be likened \"to the case of personal property taken or used in time of war or famine, or other extreme necessity[, or] to the temporary possession of land itself, on a pressing public emergency, or the spur of the occasion. In the latter case there is no change of property.\" Hence, condemnation of one's property ought to be a remedy of last resort .\n\nDe la Paz Masikip v. The City of Pasig [20] explains that the requisite of genuine public necessity is defeated by the existence of properties and remedies other than or alternative to expropriation :\n\nIn this case, petitioner contends that respondent City of Pasig failed to establish a genuine necessity which justifies the condemnation of her property. While she does not dispute the intended public purpose, nonetheless, she insists that there must be a genuine necessity for the proposed use and purposes . According to petitioner, there is already an established sports development and recreational activity center at Rainforest Park in Pasig City, fully operational and being utilized by its residents , including those from Barangay Caniogan. Respondent does not dispute this. Evidently, there is no \"genuine necessity\" to justify the expropriation.\n\nThe right to take private property for public purposes necessarily originates from \"the necessity\" and the taking must be limited to such necessity. In City of Manila v. Chinese Community of Manila , we held that the very foundation of the right to exercise eminent domain is a genuine necessity and that necessity must be of a public character. Moreover, the ascertainment of the necessity must precede or accompany and not follow, the taking of the land . In City of Manila v. Arellano Law College , we ruled that \" necessity within the rule that the particular property to be expropriated must be necessary , does not mean an absolute but only a reasonable or practical necessity, such as would combine the greatest benefit to the public with the least inconvenience and expense to the condemning party and the property owner consistent with such benefit.\"\n\nApplying this standard , we hold that respondent City of Pasig has failed to establish that there is a genuine necessity to expropriate petitioner's property. Our scrutiny of the records shows that the Certification issued by the Caniogan Barangay Council dated November 20, 1994, the basis for the passage of Ordinance No. 42 s. 1993 authorizing the expropriation, indicates that the intended beneficiary is the Melendres Compound Homeowners Association, a private, non-profit organization, not the residents of Caniogan. It can be gleaned that the members of the said Association are desirous of having their own private playground and recreational facility. Petitioner's lot is the nearest vacant space available. The purpose is, therefore, not clearly and categorically public. The necessity has not been shown, especially considering that there exists an alternative facility for sports development and community recreation in the area , which is the Rainforest Park, available to all residents of Pasig City, including those of Caniogan.\n\nThe right to own and possess property is one of the most cherished rights of men. It is so fundamental that it has been written into organic law of every nation where the rule of law prevails. Unless the requisite of genuine necessity for the expropriation of one's property is clearly established, it shall be the duty of the courts to protect the rights of individuals to their private property. Important as the power of eminent domain may be, the inviolable sanctity which the Constitution attaches to the property of the individual requires not only that the purpose for the taking of private property be specified. The genuine necessity for the taking, which must be of a public character, must also be shown to exist.\n\nSections 10 and 17 are all-encompassing in that they already a priori authorize the condemnation of \" poles, wires, cables, transformers, switching equipment and stations, buildings, infrastructure, machineries and equipment \" even during the transition period without any showing of a genuine public necessity in that there are no alternatives to taking them.\n\nPECO's situation is akin to those early cases that litigated the ban against bills of attainder :\n\nDaniel Webster was one of the most articulate critics in opposing legislative attempts to justify bills of attainder with the claim that whatever the legislature did satisfied due process or the law of the land . Webster gave his views on this issue in the cases involving Dartmouth College . Webster acted as counsel for the college in arguments before both the New Hampshire Supreme Court in 1817 and on appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court in 1819. As described in Trustees of Dartmouth College v. Woodward , the New Hampshire legislature passed a law that fundamentally altered the college's corporate form. It is significant that this was not a state college, but a wholly private one . The legislature expanded the number of trustees from 12 to 21, transferred college property to the new trustees , and authorized the treasurer to retain and hold college property against the will of the original trustees . Webster decried the legislation as unauthorized. He noted that in passing this bill, the legislature had targeted a single entity for improper treatment, passing sentence upon the college as if the legislature were a court promulgating a judgment . Webster alluded to Blackstone, noting that the New Hampshire acts \"have no relation to the community in general, and which are rather sentences than laws.\"\n\nIn response to New Hampshire's claim that its acts satisfied due process because the legislature created the law of the land, Webster noted:\n\nEverything which may pass under the form of an enactment, is not, therefore, to be considered the law of the land. If this were so, acts of attainder, bills of pains and penalties, acts of confiscation, acts reversing judgments, and acts directly transferring one man's estate to another, legislative judgments, decrees and forfeitures, in all possible forms, would be the law of the land. Such a strange construction would render constitutional provisions, of the highest importance, completely inoperative and void. It would tend directly to establish the union of all powers in the legislature.\n\nTherefore, when the legislature acts in a judicial capacity and passes a bill of attainder taking private property, and then seeks to proclaim itself above challenge in doing so, the legislature denies due process and engages in the most egregious of takings. The ban on bills of attainder was designed specifically to protect private property from such an eventuality. For Webster, New Hampshire's actions in respect to the college and the taking of its property constituted a due process/law of the land violation, and defied the separation of powers precisely because the legislature exceeded its authority and acted as a judicial body.\n\nThe 1838 Maryland case Regents of the University of Maryland v. Williams forcefully restated this point. In this case, the court decried state legislation whereby the university's property was taken and given to a new board of trustees , just as in Dartmouth College. The court commented on the legislature's improper intrusions on judicial power in these words:\n\nIf the transferring one person's property to another, by a special and particular act of the legislature, is a [sic] depriving him of his property, by or according to the law of the land, then any legislative judgment or decree, in any possible form, would be according to the law of the land, although there existed at the time no law of the land upon the subject, and that too by a tribunal possessing no judicial power, and to which all such power is denied by the constitution. Such a construction would tend to the union of all the powers of the government in the legislature, and to impart the attribute of omnipotency to that department, contrary to the genius and spirit of all our institutions; and the office of courts would be not to declare the law or to administer the justice of the country, but to execute legislative judgments and decrees, not authorized by the constitution. [21]\n\u2026.\n\nIn sum, the ban on bills of attainder is, in many ways, the quintessential declaration of the need for a separation of powers. If bills of attainder are allowed, then the legislature is supreme, and neither the judiciary nor any other body can question or set aside the legislature's acts. The ban on bills of attainder bridged the gap between the separation of powers embodied by the Constitution's framework and takings law as described in the Fifth Amendment. Bills of attainder are judicial acts by the legislature, in which the legislature defies takings law by taking property without following the proper method. A taking needs to be consummated in a certain way, and a bill of attainder is the wrong way. A legislature may not sit as a judicial body and declare whatever it does as satisfying due process or the law of the land. Hence, a proper understanding of the intent and scope of the ban on bills of attainder clarifies the separation of powers and increases an understanding of its true meaning as an unbreachable dividing line separating the reach of the different branches of government. [22]\n\nThere are existing alternatives for the properties already adjudged by RA 11212 as being \"actually necessary.\" To be sure, MORE can obtain buildings other than PECO's to establish and run its franchise. This is also true for PECO's poles, wires, cables, transformers, switching equipment and stations, infrastructure, machineries and equipment . There is no conclusive showing of genuine public necessity to expropriate these items \u2013 yet Sections 10 and 17 have already determined that they are actually necessary for expropriation.\n\nAs MORE admitted during the Committee Hearings (see below for a more extensive treatment):\n\nWell, the other option is definitely MORE Power is ready to build its own distribution assets, 'no. We can provide our own personnel and, well, again, as also mentioned during the last, I think, during the last two hearings, 'no, we were saying that personnel is not really that difficult to source, 'no, since it is readily available in the market.\"\n\nMORE also acknowledged that it can allegedly build its facilities and operate the franchise in only a year's time : \"... since I think capital is not a problem for us, if let's say, we're given at least a year, I mean I think we can ... we can actually come up with the system. Because like, let's say, substations, there are mobile standby substations that we can use immediately, deploy immediately while, let's say, building the permanent substations, 'no. So, I guess, again, I mean, since capital is not a problem for us then, I think at least a year would be more or less right ... \"\n\nThis shows the lack of genuine public necessity for the taking, which Sections 10 and 17 have unfortunately already adjudged to be present to justify the condemnation.\n\nMere convenience for MORE is not what is required by law as the basis of genuine public necessity . Even in the face of necessity, if it can be satisfied without expropriation , the same should not be imposed. The convenience of the condemning party has never been the gauge for the exercise of eminent domain.\n\nThe true standard for genuine public necessity is adequacy . Hence, when there is already an existing adequate alternatives , as in this case, even when the alternatives, for one reason or another, be inconvenient, the need to expropriate is entirely unjustified .\n\nLastly, Section 10 has as well determined a presumptive amount for the just compensation to be paid by MORE to PECO.\n\nThe deliberations have also pegged an amount for just compensation (see below).\n\nCongress has to peg the amount of just compensation because this amount would be added to MORE's billings to its consumers as a means of reimbursing itself of such payment, and therefore, would ultimately impact on MORE's viability as a franchise.\n\n[TABLE_CONTENT]\nReducing the judicial expropriation proceedings to a mere ceremonial function\n[END_TABLE]\n\nReducing the judicial expropriation proceedings to a mere ceremonial function\n\nWhat is clear from both the language of Sections 10 and 17 and the legislative intent as expressed during the Committee Hearings is the singling out of PECO and the determination by legislative fiat of the presence of all the elements to validate the taking of its properties.\n\nRA 11212 has resolved the elements of public use and genuine public necessity, and the presumptive quantum of just compensation. Thus, the statute has rendered any court proceeding on expropriation to be merely ceremonial.\n\n[TABLE_CONTENT]\nThelegislative confiscationof PECO's properties forMORE's take-overandimmediate benefit and useis thepunishmentfor PECO's alleged wrongdoings, which in turnis adirect outcomeof the non-renewal of its franchise and the award of the franchise to MORE.\n[END_TABLE]\n\nThe legislative confiscation of PECO's properties for MORE's take-over and immediate benefit and use is the punishment for PECO's alleged wrongdoings , which in turn is a direct outcome of the non-renewal of its franchise and the award of the franchise to MORE .\n\nTo stress, the element of punishment in the bill of attainder test does not mean that the legislature has to convict a person of a specified crime or to exact punishments of pain or death.\n\nBurdens and deprivations upon targeted persons or entities, without any formal legislative pronouncement of moral blameworthiness or formal intent to punish, may constitute punishment depending on this test \u2013 whether the legislation has a punitive objective or a Legitimate non-punitive legislative purpose .\n\nWhere the legitimate legislative purpose is non-existent or is far out-weighed by an intention to cause deprivation , it is reasonable to conclude , that punishment of individuals disadvantaged by the enactment was the purpose of the legislators.\n\nAs stated, the test involves two (2) steps. First, identify if the legislation looks at past conduct as a wrongdoing . Second, determine if the legislation imposes burdens or deprivations upon that past conduct . To complete the second step in the test, consider the three (3) factors in resolving whether the statute is punitive :\n\n(1) whether it fell within the historical meaning of legislative punishment (historical test),\n\n(2) whether, viewed in terms of the type and severity of burdens imposed , it could reasonably be said to further non-punitive legislative purposes (functional test), and\n\n(3) whether it evinced an intent to punish (motivational test).\n\nHere, Sections 10 and 17 of RA 11212 originated from the alleged wrongdoings of PECO as a franchise holder. Upon this alleged past misconduct , burdens and deprivations are imposed: the non-renewal of PECO's franchise, the award of the franchise to MORE , and the latter's take-over of PECO's properties through expropriation whose propriety Congress has already determined through the assailed provisions.\n\nThis fulfils the first step of the test .\n\nAs regards the secon d step , I first focus on the historical meaning of legislative punishment or the historical test of punishment . According to the congressional deliberations quoted below, the legislative confiscation of PECO's properties has been decreed to eliminate harm to innocent third parties and to the viability of MORE as the new franchise holder , i.e., the continuous supply of electricity to consumers by MORE . It may also be reasonably presumed that Congress wants to send a message via the legislated condemnation of properties to franchise holders to shape up or ship out, i.e ., general and specific deterrence . Together with the protection of people and communities, deterrence is the traditional and historical justification for punishment .\n\nAs borne by the congressional deliberations (see below), routine expropriation clauses in franchise grants do not function as the principal and primary backbone for the establishment, operation, and maintenance of a franchise. This type of clause does not settle the propriety of expropriation and allows courts to determine the propriety of expropriation. But routine expropriation clauses are unlike Sections 10 and 17 of RA 11212 where Congress has already put the bind on courts to complete the expropriation of PECO's properties to ensure the supply of electricity in the franchise area. Nothing but punishment justifies the compulsion and urgency to expropriate PECO's properties.\n\nI will also quote Senator William Gatchalian's statements which confirm the claim that PECO has been punished not only through the non-renewal of its franchise (which Congress admittedly has the constitutional authority) but also through the expropriation of PECO's properties via Sections 10 and 17. The Honorable Senator is quoted to have said:\n\nAs of March, Meralco had 6.4 million residential accounts, or 92 percent of the total in its franchise area in Metro Manila and neighboring provinces. Commercial customers accounted for 530,864 (8 percent) connections and industrial customers, 10,580 (0.2 percent).\n\n\"I'm pleased with the swift resolution (of the ERC) to impose a fine ... But the penalty of P19 million, for me, is just a drop in the bucket for Meralco,\" Gatchalian said.\n\n\"I think the almost P300 million in penalty is reasonable enough because their violation is nonconformity to the orders of the ERC,\" the senator said.\n\n\"If they still resist, I will advise ERC to mete out heftier fines and find other ways to penalize (Meralco),\"he said in a separate radio interview.\n\nNo breakdown of charges\n\nGatchalian assailed Meralco and other power distributors for their continued failure to clearly explain to their customers the breakdown of monthly charges, such as the collection of environmental fee and feed-in-tariff allowance and a universal tax on all electric consumers.\n\nHe said the recent decision of the House of Representatives to deny ABS-CBN's application for a new franchise should be a lesson to all holders of legislative licenses.\n\nIn fact, he said, any legislator could seek a review of Meralco's franchise as part of Congress' oversight authority even before the power distributor could apply for an extension.\n\n\"Based on our experience with ABS-CBN, the sins of the past can come and haunt you. In other words, during the deliberations of its franchise, this type of violation can be a basis for the revocation or non-extension of (Meralco's) franchise,\" Gatchalian said.\n\n\"This could be a 'bad record' against (Meralco) ... It could be a hindrance (for securing a new franchise),\" he cautioned.

The latter refers to the uninterrupted provision and distribution of electricity to consumers in the franchise area .\n\nLess burdensome alternatives , however, could have been resorted to by Congress to achieve this non-punitive objective. For one, it could have required the winning franchisee to be ready with its own facilities ; for another, it could have left the determination of the propriety of expropriation to the courts, without having to determine by itself that expropriation is the key to MORE's assumption as franchise-holder and that all the elements of expropriation are already present vis-\u00e0-vis PECO's properties.\n\nIndeed, while I acknowledge that Congress has a legitimate interest in ensuring the uninterrupted supply of electricity in the franchise area \u2013\n\n[TABLE_CONTENT]\n(i) | thespecificity of the affected party\u2013 PECO,\n | \n(ii) | theuniqueness of the congressional action\u2013 asadmitted by the Energy Regulatory Commissionduring the congressional deliberations (see below), and\n | \n(iii) | thebreadth of the restrictive actionin this case \u2013the wholesale condemnation of PECO's properties, since theseproperties are its only properties and will result in its bankruptcyas abusiness entityregardless of the nature of its subsequent business or businessesPECO engages in,\n[END_TABLE]\n\n(i) the specificity of the affected party \u2013 PECO, (ii) the uniqueness of the congressional action \u2013 as admitted by the Energy Regulatory Commission during the congressional deliberations (see below), and (iii) the breadth of the restrictive action in this case \u2013 the wholesale condemnation of PECO's properties , since these properties are its only properties and will result in its bankruptcy as a business entity regardless of the nature of its subsequent business or businesses PECO engages in,\n\nall these render Sections 10 and 17 disproportionately severe and thus punitive under the functional test of punishment .\n\nWorse, the public use and necessity for the confiscation of PECO\u2019s properties arose solely from the utter inability of MORE as the new franchise holder to provide the facilities and technical knowhow to establish, operate, and maintain its franchise requirements. But for this utter inability of MORE , there would have been NO non-punitive legislative purpose for the legislative confiscation of PECO's properties for MORE's take-over, benefit, and use. The non-punitive legislative purpose was a created or manufactured need when Congress allowed a non-equipped and ill-prepared entity to take-over the franchise and authorized a business plan that plainly revolved around the take-over of the existing franchise holder's properties.\n\nThus , it is reasonable to conclude that the punishment of PECO as the entity disadvantaged by RA 11212 is the legislation's only preponderant purpose .\n\nEqually troublesome, the condemnation of PECO's properties lock, stock, and barrel, is clearly overbroad in relation to the purported legitimate purpose of RA 11212. This legislated approach unnecessarily precludes PECO from dedicating and using its properties for business purposes other than the distribution of electricity in the franchise area.\n\n[TABLE_CONTENT]\nThecongressional deliberationson the precursors of RA 11212make it crystal clearthatSections 10and17 exhibit all the elementsof abill of attainder.\n[END_TABLE]\n\nThe congressional deliberations on the precursors of RA 11212 make it crystal clear that Sections 10 and 17 exhibit all the elements of a bill of attainder.\n\nThe legislative intent to punish or the motivational test of punishment unearths Sections 10 and 17 as products of congressional deliberations which show the intent to single out PECO, adjudge it as guilty of wrongdoings , and confiscate its properties for MORE's convenient takeover .\n\nThe congressional deliberations revolved around MORE's business plan to take over the operations and properties of PECO \u2013 simply because MORE has none of the facilities AND personnel to establish, operate and maintain its franchise .

Iyon naman lang po gusto namin dito.\n\nWe are one with you as far as that aspect is concerned. Kasi mahirap na... alam mo po pag pinag-uusapan natin ang mahal na kuryente, madali tayong umangal. But ang hindi natin nare-realize ang pinakamahal na kuryente ay iyong walang kuryente. And we're talking about inflation here, mahal ang gastusin sa bigas, marami ang nagugutom. Pero pag dineprayb(deprive) ninyo iyong mga kababayan natin from Iloilo na mapanood iyong Probinsiyano, patay tayong lahat diyan. That's the reason why we're trying to help you achieve your goals also. So, you mentioned wala kayong infrastructure right now. Wala kayong substation, wala kayong linya currently, and you intend to take... to supply them by year 2017... ah, 2019. Doon lang po ako may worry na ano. Kasi, well, you can contract although until such time that your amendments are approved the Securities and Exchange Commission, then you can contract with suppliers. But again iyong goal ninyo is to distribute and by distribution you need all these infrastructures and facilities. You need the substation na pagdadalahan n'yo, para icascade ninyo, ibaba ninyo, you need the 69 KB lines. You need secondary and collateral lines. You need all the transformers to bring it down to the consumers. Kaya sabi ko nga po sa inyo eh mahirap tayong hindi natin mabigyan iyong Iloilo ng kuryente. So, can you just enlighten this Representation and also this Committee on the exact plan as far as MORE Corporation is concerned?\n\nMR. CASTRO. Yes, Your Honor. Thank you for that comment, Your Honor. Yeah. Again, our base case, I would say, is the... if the franchise of PECO will end and we may have... well, we will be granted the franchise, 'no, is, well, we will take over the assets of PECO, 'no. And, well, these are... Your Honor, that's correct that, well, depriving consumers of power, \u2018no, is\u2026 well, our primary\u2026 well, is not\u2026 well, may not be good. It's not really good. But what we have in mind, Your Honor, is that in the long term, 'no, when... if we are able because we are confident that we will be able to bring down the rates, 'no. I mean, given the basket of suppliers that they have now as was flashed earlier, they are not taking advantage.

And from the official records that we have seen that are publicly available, there is only one big customer, all the rest. .. well, I would distributed between residential, commercial establishments, government offices, 'yun. So, it's a... well, definitely there are commercial, especially recently when Megawide or Megaworld, Ayala and all the others started to put up the malls the last two... well, three to four The... well, rather, the customer profile has already... well, for commercial has already increased but in terms of industrial, I would say it is on the low side, Your Honor.\n\nREP. UYBARRETA. And these malls that you mentioned, are they sourcing their power sa current franchise holder or are they directly connected?\n\nMR. CASTRO. Yes, Your Honor. They are sourcing their power from the current franchise holder , Your Honor.\n\nREP. UYBARRETA. So it is, more or less, safe to presume that the bulk of the revenue comes from these three malls that you mentioned?\n\nMR. CASTRO. Well, if we lump the commercial establishments together vis-a-vis the whole customer profile, well, I would say that, yes. I mean, it's a significant contribution coming from the commercial... what you call this, commercial portion, Your Honor.\n\nREP. UYBARRETA. Given the franchise area that you are applying for and the customer mix and profile, in your estimate, how many substation do you need? Kasi part of the problem as far as outages are concerned is the lack of substation, so I think it's within your CapEx plan, so how many do you ...\n\nMR. CASTRO. Your Honor, well, per our technical, the existing five actually are sufficient for now.

Mr. Chair, over and above what they presented today and the business plan, can we also get from them a more technical report and plan regarding how they intend to distribute electricity to the franchise area that they are applying for. Kasi ganito lang po iyan, at the end of the day, we are answerable to the consumers of the franchise area that you are applying for, while they are saying that it's hard to reinvent the wheel, pero alam naman po natin and meron palang existing franchise ngayon doon and why fix something that is not broken. That's just my concern. But I also advance the concept that we... the customer is the boss. Ultimately, kung anong ikabubuti ng consumer, doon tayo and part of our oversight function here is to safeguard the interest of the consumers. We are... I am asking hard questions because, ultimately, si Chairman ko ang sisisihin kung sakaling maano tayo. So, Mr. Chair, if I may just be allowed a few more question, just for my satisfaction?

Ang problema lang kung ... eh, paano kung hindi ibenta sa inyo?\n\nMR. CASTRO. Yes, Mr. Chair, Your Honor. Well, based on the financial statements that we've seen of PECO, the hard assets or... yeah, the hard assets out of that about three billion of total assets, the hard assets that's directly related to the business is about 460 or 480 million pesos.\n\nREP. UYBARRETA. Four hundred sixty?\n\nMR. CASTRO. If I'm not mistaken it's in the region of 460 to 480 million pesos, Your Honor. So, well, if there will be an offer, then, definitely, we can ... well, we will buy the assets and to the extent that we think would be justifiable. Because at the end of the day, well, whatever the price is, is a price to certain extent that would be reflected into the bills of the consumers, anyway.\n\nREP. UYBARRETA. Yes. That's where I'm getting to.\n\nMR. CASTRO. Yes, Your Honor.\n\nREP. UYBARRETA. Kasi ang promise ninyo kanina is to lower the rates.\n\nMR. CASTRO. Yes, Your Honor.\n\nREP. UYBARRETA.

Definitely, we will ... what do you call this, we will have to agree on what that price is because as I was mentioning earlier, Your Honor, well, if it's priced too much and it will be reflected in the rates, anyway, and it wouldn't help in bringing down the rates for the consumers, then we may have to opt for other... other option which is maybe through ... well, if we put up our own ...\n\nREP.

Thank you, Mr. Chair. I would like to ask this question sa ERC. Sabi ni Cong. Caloy na ang nagiging problema, what happens in a scenario wherein one has the franchise and the other one has the asset, anong magiging remedy ng ERC diyan? Anong ruling ninyo diyan? Paano ninyo didiskartehan iyan?\n\nMR MAATUBANG. ML Chair, Your Honor, actually, we have submitted that in our position paper, Your Honor, and already discussed that during the previous hearing, Your Honor, that in the event that there are two DUs in one geographical location, there will be economies of scale, that problem. So, in the end, there will be a problem with the consumers. And in terms of assets, Your Honor, that's the problem, the other one has no assets on how it will be delivered their electricity and the other one has the assets.\n\nREP. TAMBUNTING. In the event that only one will be given the franchise, ang isang assumption mo riyan sa statement mo, dalawa sila.\n\nMR. MAATUBANG. Yes, Sir.\n\nREP. TAMBUNTING. Ngayon, kung isa paano?\n\nMR. MAATUBANG. That's the problem, Your Honor. So that will be a problem in terms of regulation, in terms of prices because there will be economies of scales in terms of rate regulations, Your Honor. And at the same time, the one with no asset, Your Honor, basically they will ... there's the option to tap the other one for the billing of the service which is being done right now, like for the sales in our electric cooperatives. That would also be a scenario, Your Honor.\n\nREP. TAMBUNTING. So iyong mga... ang precedence niyan will be the winning franchise holder will have to negotiate with the one with the asset and acquire. Ganyan ang mangyayari diyan. Iyong. mga cooperatives na sinasabi mo kapag, may nananalong iba, siya ang bumibili nung asset nung natalo. Tama ba iyon? Iyon ba ang precedence niyon?\n\nMR. MAATUBANG. No, Your Honor. I am just only saying that in case there are two DUs, then one DU that has no assets, has to.,. has an option to wheel its power to the other one. So they will have to rent the distribution utility to deliver its power to its customers , Your Honor.\n\nREP. GATCHALIAN. Mr. Chair, can we ask that is allowable by law, what you are saying?\n\nMR. MAATUBANG. Yes, right now it's open access, Your Honor. That is allowed, Your Honor.\n\nREP. TAMBUNTING. You know, when we award a franchise, only Congress has the power to take it back because you cannot rise above sa source. Kung ang sinabi namin ikaw ang franchise holder, you cannot sublease your franchise and give it to somebody else without informing Congress because that's not transferable. So I don't think that is allowed. Your opinion, I think, is not really happening na ang prangkisa ha, prangkisa that emanates from Congress is being transferred to a different entity without the knowledge of Congress or permission from Congress.\n\nMR. MAATUBANG. No, Your Honor, what I am saying is that in terms of access of electricity. For example, if an end-user wants to get power from other sources other than the DU, they can wheel that power to the host DU.\n\nREP. GATCHALIAN. Mr. Chair, I think ERC has an attorney here, their legal. So maybe the question of Congressman Tambunting is better answered by Attorney Arjay.\n\nMR. ARJAY LOUIE B. CUANAN (Attorney III, Energy Regulatory Commission). Yes, good morning, Mr. Chair. Good morning to the Members of the Committee. Actually, the question is if there is a precedent already, if the legislative franchise has been transferred or subleased to other cooperatives. Is that right?\n\nREP. TAMBUNTING. Yes.\n\nREP. GATCHALIAN. Is that allowable by law and is there a precedent already that happened before, for the appreciation of the Committee?\n\n[TABLE_CONTENT]\n5. | Theforced condemnation by legislation ofPECO's properties toserve the business interests of MOREas the new franchisee isunprecedentedand thefirst of its kindin franchise law-making and regulation.\n[END_TABLE]\n\n5. The forced condemnation by legislation of PECO's properties to serve the business interests of MORE as the new franchisee is unprecedented and the first of its kind in franchise law-making and regulation .\n\nMR. CUANAN. Yes. Regarding the first question, Your Honor, the law explicitly provides that it is not allowed to transfer or to lease the legislative franchise that has been granted by, Congress, without the permission or without the consent of the Congress itself, their granting power.\n\nWith respect to the second question, we actually don't have the idea yet if there is ... if the said subleasing of legislative franchise has been happening because as what we've said, this is not... this is prohibited by law.\n\nREP. TAMBUNTING. So can we go back to the first question which is, what happens if one has the franchise and the person, the incumbent whose franchise will lapse and has the assets but with no franchise, so one has the permission, the permit but the other one has the asset. What is now...how would ERC rule on this?\n\nMR. CUANAN. Actually, Your Honor, as we speak today, we have not ruled on that particular, we have not encountered such particular issue so far, where there is a franchise holder and the other one has the asset. So probably, the existing franchise holder will take over or will buyout the assets of the old franchise holder.\n\nREP. GATCHALIAN. So, if they will take over, through a corporate takeover, then hindi na ho nila kailangan humarap ngayong umaga dito, So they will take over the company...\n\nREP. GATCHALIAN. (Continuing) \u2026 the company if they want to, the corporate entity if they wanna take over the assets only without the corporate entity. And the corporate itself, the PECO, already has a franchise eh. So, why are you applying a new franchise here, if that's your intention, ha? We're just trying to understand.\n\nMR. CUANAN. Sorry, Your Honor. I think PECO has a separate juridical entity. If they want to maintain, I mean they want to have a juridical... separate juridical personality from PECO, the existing franchise holder, so they need to secure a franchise.\n\nREP. GATCHALIAN. So, hindi na ho applicable iyong sinagest(suggest) ni Engineer Maatubang and the question of the Honorable Tambunting about Company A who has the asset and Company B... but losing, 'no, and Company B who has the liquidity but wants to take over the asset . So, that's what we're trying to connect here and if that is allowable also by law, kayong ERC ang makakasagot diyan.\n\nMR. CUANAN. Okay. For that, Your Honor, MORE Corporation has to secure legislative franchise. And if they will be given that franchise or granted that franchise then, probably, they can secure or buyout the assets of PECO, which is the existing franchise holder, if in case PECO will ... PECO's franchise will not be renewed. Okay, Mr. Chairman.\n\nREP. GATCHALIAN. So, the asset only, not including the franchise. What if PECO's franchise was renewed?\n\nMR. CUANAN. Actually, we have not encountered that, Your Honor. We have no precedent on that because... we have actually one which is Bicol Light which is already ... which is still pending before the Senate. But we have not encountered a situation where there are two distribution utilities within the geographical area.\n\nTHE CHAIRPERSON. Okay, before that, the Chair would like to recognize Congressman Montoro.\n\nI have just one additional question. Iyong pinaka... from what I understand iyong pinaka-question kasi, paano iyong transition period, for example nga sa scenario na ma-approve ang MORE? And then, let's say, hindi ma-renew kaagad iyong PECO since January mag-e-expire na, sino'ng magsu-supply ng kuryente, habang iyong MORE o iyong period na iyon na mag-expire ang PECO? Ano iyong MORE kunwari magse-set up pa nu'ng kanilang infra ng equipment, siyempre mag..medyo may kakailanganin na time iyon eh especially if hindi naman bibilhin iyong assets na existing. So, sino'ng magsu-supply sa Panay? Like, iyong ERC ba nagbibigay ba kayo ng provisional authority na mag-operate muna sila until such time na ready na iyong MORE? Or, papaano ang magiging set-up? Hindi naman puwedeng mag-brownout iyong Panay.\n\nREP. TEODORO G. MONTORO. Mr. Chair, can I?\n\nREP. TAMBUNTING. I think... yes. So, is it. .. Attorney, I think the... to amend, 'no, the question really is, what if there is a standoff and they don't want to sale to the winning bidder? What... how would you rule? Would you give a PA to them pending the approval, the sale?\n\nMR. CUANAN. Sir, may I just hand over the floor to Engineer Maatubang?\n\nMR. MAATUBANG. Your Honor, if that is the case, Your Honor, there will be a problem in regulations in terms of how we will regulate the two distribution utilities, That's the... that's what our concern here that was submitted in this Honorable Commission.\n\nREP. TAMBUNTING. I think very specific naman po iyong tanong. Iyong tanong is kung hindi sila magka\". alam nating magkakaproblema kaya nga ho kami nagtatanong sa inyo, 'no. Alam namin may problema.

Sir, since we don't encounter yet this particular issue, can we refer this yet to the Committee, if ever, I mean, to the Commission, ever? Give us an opportunity to confer the matter to the Commission. Because our existing policy is we grant Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessit... Necessity and Convenience to the distribution utility and that is based on the legi... or dependent on the legislative franchise being granted by the Congress. So, if the franchise is denied, so immediately ipso facto the CPCN is also denied.\n\nREP. TAMBUNTING. Correct.\n\u2026.\n\nMr. Chair, we are walking on very thin ice here, sabi nga ng ERC, this is the very first time that this is happening . Kasi nga po, ang distribution and transmission business is a natural monopoly, accepted po iyan in any country and all over the world that distribution and transmission is a natural monopoly kasi po sa laki ng gastos para mag set up ng facilities. I heard that MORE committed that they will be able to put up their facilities, their complete distribution facilities within one year, I don't want to debunk that or ano, I just wish them well. But we know for a fact that just to set up one substation entails a lot of years and months, that's just one substation. And during last hearing, it was stated that for one distribution utilities to be able to supply the need of the franchise area that we are referring to or we are discussing here, a minimum of five substations will be required. That is capital intensive. We are not even talking about the distribution lines. We are not even talking about 'yung mga capacitor, 'yung mga transformers, the meters, the new meters, the new lines that will be put in. Again, kaya I just appeal for us to be very, very careful in deciding this. I will go for any move to give better service to any given consumers. I'm all for that. But I'm also on the side of caution kasi nga ano eh, I have nothing against MORE , if they can promise better service, I'm all for that kasi at the end of the day, we are all here for the welfare of the consumers. But I just caution that kasi hindi natin napag-uusapan 'yung aspeto na 'yon that the signal that we will be ending to the lending institution and to the investors, kung ano man ang gagawin natin dito, will have repercussion on that. That's just my manifestation, Mr. Chair.\n\u2026.\n\nMR. OFALSA. (Continuing)...EPIRA po, RA 9136, may third party valuation po na isa\u00ad submit on the valuation of the assets. But for now po, when a... sa existing policy ng ERC in existing distribution utilities, we have guidelines using a standard on how we value the assets po. Katulad po sa electric cooperatives, we use the NEA guidelines on the valuation of the assets. For private utilities for purposes of performance-based regulated, we use po iyong SKM valuation namin. This is more on technical valuation of the existing assets of all distribution utilities po.\n\nREP. TAMBUNTING. So, in previous take overs, this is the same formula that was used.\n\nMR. OFALSA. Wala pa kasi kami, Sir, I do not recall of any take overs of distribution. Siguro, Sir, in the past, iyong mga maliliit, ano, iyong mga una...\n\nREP. TAMBUNTING.

Do they know na nag-submit kayo?\n\nMR. CASTRO. Mr. Chair, Your Honor, well, we have not yet, well, gone formally to PECO regarding this, Your Honor.\n\nREP. MONTORO. Exactly, Mr. Chair, magkakaroon tayo ng problema rito later on kasi wala pa silang communication or formal communication with that current holder.

Baka magkaroon tayo ng problema later on. Mag-aano tayo tapos sila pa ang may hawak. [25]\n\nx x x x\n\nREP. UNABIA. So, Mr. Chair, I understand the franchise of PECO will expire on January, 2019? Can I ask MORE Minerals Corporation, if ever, Mr. Chair, if ever they will be granted a franchise, 'no, how long can you put up your, for example, DU or distribution to Iloilo, if ever?\n. . . .\nMR. ROEL Z. CASTRO (President, MORE Minerals Corporation). Good morning, Honorable Committee and Honorable Chair. To the question of the Honorable Unabia, if we were to put up our own system I think it would take about a year, more or less. But, again, I mean, we are still looking at the ... at the mode wherein we could ...we could take over the assets, of course, with just compensation to the existing franchise holder, Mr. Chair. Thank you.\n. . . .\nREP. PANCHO. Ilang years po? Kasi ang sabi po nila ay it will take them at least a year to construct iyong mga bagong mga infrastructure nila. So, ilan po ang nakikita ninyo na ideal number of years na kailangan nating ibigay para doon sa winding period?\n\nMS. GINES. Your Honors, ang isa pong alternative to them putting up is to, iyon na nga po, take over the current facilities but subject to the payment of just compensation. Kasi mayroon din naman pong portion of the cost of those facilities na equity ng PECO and then you also have the obligations. So, iyon po iyong isang alternative para ho dire-diretso iyong service pong kuryente. Pero iyon na nga po ang sinabi ko ho kanina, strictly speaking po. Kaya po sabi ko po kanina, strictly speaking, iyon po talaga iyong legal implication without a franchise. But I don't think na pagdating po ng alas onse... 11:59 ng gabi, eh, talagang magsha-shutoff. Hindi naman po. Hindi naman po siguro ganoon ang mangyayari.\n\n\u2026.\n\nREP. UYBARRETA. Just, actually, I will not be asking too much question already because except for the fact that I requested for a technical report which I got this morning. However, just to.. for us as the Committee on Franchise, to have a wider perspective of what we are doing right now. Iyong sinabi kanina that both DUs will be operating at a loss, in layman's term, ang sinasabi doon is pahabaan ng pisi, kung sino 'yung makakatagal na lugi magpatakbo ng negosyo at mag-survive, iyon 'yung matitira. Mr. Chair, that's a very dangerous business practice. Mahirap po if we are enticing investors to come in in our country at sasabihin natin, \"Pahabaan kayo ng pisi, eh anyway parehas kayong lugi eh.\" That's a very dangerous business concept for us. Now, just so that we will have a bigger picture also. I'm pretty sure because of my experience sa DUs and the electric cooperatives, I'm pretty sure that the existing franchise has existing loans, one hundred percent ako sure diyan, one hundred and ten percent sure ako diyan, they have existing loans because most of the time, when you upgrade or even repair your facilities, you take in loan and then you apply that sa capex application, ina-apply sa ERC and then the ERC would give them the proper rate and a time frame or a time table to recover. Naka-apply po. Now, assuming this thing will happen, ang bigger question natin is, ano ang mangyayari sa existing loans ng existing franchise holder? Are we giving a very bad signal to the investors and to the lending institutions that we have?\n\nMr. Chair, we are walking on very thin ice here, sabi nga ng ERC, t his is the very first time that this is happening . Kasi nga po, ang distribution and transmission business is a natural monopoly, accepted po iyan in any country and all over the world that distribution and transmission is a natural monopoly kasi po sa laki ng gastos para mag set up ng facilities. I heard that MORE committed that they will be able to put up their facilities, their complete distribution facilities within one year, I don't want to debunk that or ano, I just wish them well.

TAMBUNTING. Mr. Chair, may I ask the More representatives? Do you agree with the formula presented by ERC?\n\nMR. CASTRO. Your Honors, yes, we agree with the formula. Now, however, still I think... well, when it comes... because there has been no experience on private company take over and... well, and let me just say that. ..just going back to that question... to the answer earlier that there has to be just compensation and I think this is related to that, Mr. Chair. The question is if, let's say, the asking price of the... well, of the existing asset owner is too high that would jeopardize the rate, ano, to the end consumer, still I think... well, an approach might not be totally acceptable because, at the end of the day, it's gonna be the consumers who will take it. So, that's why I think there has to be a deeper study on who actually owns really the assets, I mean, upon take over. Because as you correctly pointed out, part of it has already been recovered. In fact, if.. well, from the distribution assets right now, if, let's say, there are assets that are fully recovered which means that consumers have already paid for it over a period of time, the question is does it still ... make sure that it's still owned by PECO wherein...\n\nREP. TAMBUNTING. Correct.\n\nMR. CASTRO.... well, a company like us who would be negotiating for just compensation be included in the asset-based. [26]\n\nx x x x\n\nREP. TAMBUNTING. Thank you very much, Atty. Jan. For the transition plan which has been submitted to the ComSec, maybe we can ask Mr. Roel Castro to expound on this, with the permission of the Chair.\n\nTHE CHAIRPERSON. Mr. Castro, do you have a presentation or...\n\nMR. ROEL Z. CASTRO (President, MORE Electric and Power Corporation). Good morning, Your Honors. Yes, we have a short presentation on the transition plan.\n\nREP. TAMBUNTING. Please proceed.\n\nMR. CASTRO. Next, please. So, upon granting of franchise, Monte Oro Power will negotiate with PECO for the purchase of its distribution assets. Assuming that there is... that it is positive then we will apply for the certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity and we will deploy technical personnel to conduct the operations improvement plan; develop the planning and control processes for operations and maintenance; deploy security; and conduct a total system and network audit. Should the negotiation be successful, as stated during the last hearing, we are... actually we are open and we would like to hire the existing personnel of PECO; develop a total distribution network development plan; implement the processes to determine the cost-effective capital investments, establish maintenance program; create the corporate planning group to establish and optimize management processes. Now, if there is a failure to reach an agreement, which means that PECO and MORE Power cannot... well, has no agreement on terms, MORE Power will file an expropriation case, 'no, the right to expropriate is integral part of the franchise if approved, and MORE Power will definitely pay just compensation to PECO as determined by the court.\n\nWell, if we're still on the premise that there is a failure to reach an agreement, MORE Power will have a standby quick maintenance and response team which we are in the process of putting together that we can readily deploy in case there will be a need, in case of emergency situations where major installation like substations will be compromised. We are also in the process of already looking for a possible mobile standby substations that will be backed-up by the emergency response team. And these are facilities that are readily available. Now, for the technical and operational readiness, our... well, we're contemplating that the emergency response team which is made up of engineers, technicians, and specialists who will man important facilities/like substations are ready on call for a 24/7 deployment. Standby mobile substations in case of emergency, third-party line maintenance team and crew is also being ... we're in the process of already getting these team. The third party meter readers, as well as, we will make sure that the customer relations desk would be available 24/7 also in cooperation with the different media outlets to make sure that if there are questions or maybe any confusion ...\n\nMR. CASTRO. (Continuing) ... confusion from the customer side, we will be able to respond to those queries. Well, the other option is definitely MORE Power is ready to build its own distribution assets, 'no. We can provide our own personnel and, well, again, as also mentioned during the last, I think, during the last two hearings, 'no, we were saying that personnel is not really that difficult to source, 'no, since it is readily available in the market. Now, on human resources, MORE Power will hire the services of the current employees who may be willing to work with us. MORE Power will hire a competent local HR Manager and, as we speak now, we actually already have applications from different... from a number of HR practitioners from Iloilo, 'no, to lay down the process of employment and among this, priority is really giving the training and development of its employees. Plans and programs-well, this is on the assumption that, well, the... we're able to come in which is... which has been laid down in the plans and programs that we've submitted to the Committee. We will make a thorough system audit. Prepare the necessary repair maintenance and even... well, from the audit, I think we'll be able to already find out if what are the improvements, immediate medium-term and long-term improvements, that will be needed. And immediately deploy the SCADA system throughout the franchise area. Well, on the distribution plan, well, I think these are some details already which we can move to the next. So, in conclusion, MORE Power will be prepared to implement the following from transition period and bring it to normal operations as soon as possible. Again, the smooth transition of normal operations including hiring of deserving employees, infusion of sufficient funding, develop and design the new distribution system, develop/implement new set of maintenance operating rules, the balance of energy, continuous training, improve responsiveness increase system, reliability and bring down the systems loss. With that, I'd like to thank the Committee for giving us the opportunity to present the transition plan. Thank you.\n\n\u2026.\n\nREP. PADUANO. It's still pending in the Committee. Now, Mr. Chair, just an observation during the presentation of the MORE. Kasi nandun nakalagay, ongoing 'yung negotiation with the PECO para... to take over. So, ang tanong ko, Mr. Chair, ano na ngayon ang status ng negotiation? Kasi, Mr. Chair, 'pag binigyan natin ng prangkisa itong MORE, it follows dapat banda sila. Kasi the consumers in Panay Island, hindi puwedeng maghintay, hindi ba? Hindi puwedeng maghintay. 'Yung question nung expropriation, if we give them the franchise. But what if... what if. .. if we also renew the franchise, 'di ba? If we... if this Committee and this House will renew their franchise, it follows na mas nauna 'to, ang PECO, mas sila ang nagsisimula sa ngayon, 'di ba? Sa ngayon sila. Of course, it is allowed, it's a free competition. But 'yung point ko, 'yung sinasabi niyong negotiation in the presentation, siguro naman dapat malaman natin kung ano na ang status ng negotiation. And nandito rin pala 'yung mga taga-PECO. Kasi, Mr. Chair, 'yun 'yung sinasabi ko, eh, if we grant MORE because free competition natin, now... and we also grant the renewal, it follows 'yung PECO naghahanda pa. If negotiation between PE... no, 'yung MORE, if negotiation between PECO and MORE failed kung i-grant natin ang PECO and there is a pending bill in this Committee. So, Mr. Chair, I just want to be clarified about the ongoing negotiation. 'Wag muna tayo pumunta doon sa question nung granting of franchise kasi, what if it failed? I-expropriate niyo, eh, there's a pending application in this Committee, this House. So, medyo may problema tayo doon. Kaya 'yung position or proposal, 'yung negotiation, medyo may problema tayo if PECO will not negotiate with you. Walang compromise, walang agreement. Now, the question is, are you prepared? Kung kompetisyon, okay. No problem with that. But 'yung sinasabi ko existing ... existing ngayon 'yung PECO and they are applying for renewal. 'Yun lang 'yung... 'yun lang 'yung medyo mahirap kong intindihin, 'no. Hindi ko maintindihan na ongoing 'yung negotiation, nag apply din sila, 'yung PECO, for renewal. So... Thank you, Mr. Chair.\n\u2026.\nMR. CASTRO. Well, next... sorry, Mr. Chair, next slide, please. Well, there was no mention that there is an ongoing negotiation, I mean, just to clarify. What we said is that, upon granting of the franchise, we will start... we will negotiate with PECO. So, there has been no statement about an ongoing negotiation.\n\nMr. Chair. Atty. Benny?\n\nMR. TAN. Your Honor, we would prefer to negotiate so... we are not sure if we'll get our franchise so it would be presumptuous to negotiate now. Once it becomes clear that we will be able to get our franchise, we have to hurdle Senate pa. Then, we will negotiate with PECO. You mentioned the possibility that PECO will also get its franchise. Yeah, in that situation, it will be an open competition, so we will not be able to... to acquire their distribution assets. We will have to build our own distribution assets in such situation where there are two franchise holder for the same area, Your Honor.\n\n\u2026.\n\nMR. OFALSA. Okay. The letter is dated September 2018, addressed to Honorable Franz Alvarez, Chairperson, Committee on Legislative Franchise. \"During the House Representatives' Committee on Legislative Franchises hearing on House Bill No. 81 last September 12, 2018, the Energy Regulatory Commission was directed to submit its supplemental position paper on the said bill. In compliance with the said directive, please find attached ERC's Supplemental Position Paper in response to the queries and additional information requested during the hearing. We hope that the Committee will consider the same during the deliberation of this piece of legislation. Thank you.\" Signed by Chairperson and CEO, Agnes V.S.T. Devanadera.\n\nThe letter... the title of this position is ERC's Supplemental Position Paper on House Bill No. 8132, AN ACT GRANTING THE MORE MINERALS CORPORATION A FRANCHISE TO ESTABLISH, OPERATE AND MAINTAIN FOR COMMERCIAL PURPOSES AND IN THE PUBLIC INTEREST A DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM FOR CONVEYANCE OF ELECTRIC POWER TO END-USERS IN THE CITY OF ILOILO, IN THE PROVINCE OF ILOILO.\n\nDuring the Committee on Legislative Franchises' hearing on House Bill 81 last September 18, 2018, legal issues and operational concerns on the occurrence of any of the following scenarios were raised, namely....\n\nWe go now to scenario number two - where franchise is granted to MMC and PECOs franchise is not renewed. PECO is the existing franchise electric utility with exclusive authority to operate and maintain a distribution system in Iloilo City. As such, PECO owns the only existing distribution assets in Iloilo City. In the event that PECO's franchise is not renewed and another entity that is MMC is given the franchise to operate and maintain a distribution system in Iloilo City, a question was raised on whether PECO will be allowed to operate the existing distribution system during the transition phase of MORE Minerals. As earlier pointed out in the supplemental position paper, an entity operating and maintaining a distribution system must first secure a franchise. In the case of PECO, once existing franchise expires, it may no longer in the business of distribution of electricity and ERC has no legal basis to issue any authority to PECO for the latter to operate its distribution system. As ERC has no authority over PECO after the expiration of the latter's franchise, the ERC will defer to the wisdom of the Congress on whether to grant PECO a legislative franchise that will allow PECO to continue operating its distribution system.\n\n\u2026.\n\nMR. INOCENCIO FERRER, JR. (Board Member, Panay Electric Company). Good morning, Mr. Chairman. Sorry but I have flu, 'no, so my voice is not very clear. I am Atty. Inocencio Ferrer, Jr. I represent PECO and the majority of the Board Members of PECO. Mr. Chairman, we have previously filed several letters opposing the House Bill of Congressman Gus Tambunting. And in answer directly to the question of whether or not PECO is amenable to selling its assets or the company to MORE, I can categorically say... state that after conferring with the majority owners of PECO, they are not amenable to sell their assets and they will contest and bring to court any move by MORE to use the government power to expropriate their assets and give it to a private entity . It is our position, Mr. Chairman, that based on the presentation of the President of MORE, he actually admitted that they don't have any assets on the electrical power distribution. He admitted that. In fact, his only plan is to buy us out and if we refuse to sell, then he will invoke the government... the government... he will use the government to expropriate our assets and award it to a private entity. Number two, the President of MORE admitted now, that's why I wanted him to admit it under oath that they don't have any personnel. They don't have any technicians, experts in the field of electric power distribution and their only plan is to hire our employees. Third, Your Honor, I don't think what he presented is a rollout plan. Usually, a rollout plan tells the Honorable Members the year-to-year activities of MORE to purchase equipment, to install equipment, to apply for permits on the barangay level, the city level to install their infrastructure. They should present that to the Chairman year-to-year. Every year how much assets they will buy. Every year, how many employees they will hire. Every year, how many equipment that they will purchase. But they have not submitted a rollout plan. Instead, what they are actually telling the public is they will invoke the power of the Constitution to expropriate our property and to award it to a private entity. I think, Your Honor, that will violate the Anti-Graft Law. Anyway, we will question that in the Supreme Court. Your Honor, may I, again, ask the Chairman to distribute the various opposition... the various opposition submitted to this Honorable Committee against... the opposition against... the very strong opposition against the application of MORE. In fact, the biggest association of power distributors, electric power distributors, in the Philippines submitted a very, very strong objection. They are the expert in the field and this association, PEPOA, they are called PEPOA, and PEPOA is a Private Electric Power Operators Association of the Philippines, the only expert association of private operator, strongly oppose the application of MORE because they don't have any assets. MORE does not have a single asset on the ground now in Iloilo City, nothing. Their only plan is just to expropriate our property and allow the government to pay us in court. Second, the Private Electric Power Operators Association, which represents all... all the private electric power distributors in the country, strongly supported the House Bill of Congressman Xavier Jesus Romualdo, House Bill 6023, in favor of PECO.... Finally, Your Honor, at that time that MORE filed its application on August 22, less than 40 days ago, MORE was a mining company. It was a mining company with only 2.5 million pesos capital and it did not have a single experience or track record in electric power distribution. Therefore, at that time they filed the application, they were not entitled. They were not qualified. And if they are now submitting the amendment of their Article, it merely states that they have... what? Two hundred fifty million pesos and they are going to try to takeover a multi\u00ad billion peso existing electric power distribution. That is incredible...\n\n\u2026.\n\nMR. CASTRO. Thank you very much, Your Honor. Well, just to reiterate, well, what we've stated during the first hearing. Yes, while we still don't have the ... I would say, the... the full complement, but, well, at the officers' level , we actually have an experienced general manager of an electric cooperative which is about three times, at least three times bigger than PECO, with a customer base of over 200 thousand, and by experience, was able to bring down systems losses from double digit to single digit, 'no. We have another general manager of another electric coop who will be joining us very soon. Again, his experience is a customer base four times bigger than that of PECO. PECO is about 60 thousand. This another GM that we are-and I'm not yet in the position to name him-actually has been managing electric coop of another urbanized area of about 225 thousand customers, ano. And experience would show na in his management, he was able to bring down systems losses and was able to turn around the... the financials of this utility from barely negative to positive. Also together with us is a former Undersecretary of Energy and former NAPOCOR President, Cyril Del Callar, who is very much acquainted with the power industry from the very time he joined, well, his law profession in the power industry and up to this date. Well, on the... on the owner's side, Monte Oro was also ... we were part owner of the National Grid Corporation of the Philippine, when we privatized TransCo, 'no. And NGCP, we won the bid for 3.95 billion U.S. Dollars and we were able to ... well, we had... we have the capital, we had the we were able to comply with what was needed on the financial side, needed by the by the government that's why we were awarded that franchise for the National Grid Corporation of the Philippines. And as we had... we have the capital, we had the we were able to comply with what was needed on the financial side, needed by the by the government that's why we were awarded that franchise for the National Grid Corporation of the Philippines. And as we....\n\nREP. A. M. BRAVO. Thank you very much, idol. Assuming that MORE is capable of putting up the infrastructure, questioning their capability maybe, well, not proper as of this present as made mentioned by the author that it requires first a franchise so that they will be able to build up the facilities. Assuming that they are capable of building up and maybe to ... after such build up they will be ready to propel the business in favor of the consumer it will take how many years do you think to do it?\n\nMR. CASTRO. Well, in our...\n\nREP. A. M. BRAVO. On an assumption that PECO will not sell.\n\nMR. CASTRO. Mr. Chair, Honorable Chair, in our opinion, well, since I think capital is not a problem for us, if let's say, we're given at least a year, I mean I think we can ... we can actually come up with the system. Because like, let's say, substations, there are mobile standby substations that we can use immediately, deploy immediately while, let's say, building the permanent substations, 'no. So, I guess, again, I mean, since capital is not a problem for us then, I think at least a year would be more or less right , Mr. Chair. Thank you.\n\n\u2026.\n\nREP. ANICETO JOHN D. BERTIZ. Idol ko 'yun si Bravo, pero I'm so honored that I was called. Good morning po, good morning, Mr. Chair. Actually, my question is in line with the... just a follow-up question with Congressman Anthony Bravo. Of course, it is incumbent for us, for this Committee to know what arc the transitory plans and I would like to ask more... no, I mean, I will not ask more but the MORE Mineral Corporation to know about what is your immediate plan because our worry is from now until January when PECO expires, what will be your immediate plan? Because you know, that's the only time you will start putting up your electric posts, whatsoever, power plant, et cetera, et cetera, clearances, right of way, issues, trees to be cut, DENR, et cetera, et cetera. So, ano 'yung mangyayari? Comes January, na ano ang mangyayari doon sa ilang libong consumers or users ng existing power plant? So I just would like to know what is your immediate '\" because, you know, we cannot leave those thousands of families, you know, push them back to the dark ages especially in Iloilo. Thank you, Mr. Chair.\n\nTHE CHAIRPERSON. Mr. Castro.\n\nMR. CASTRO. Your Honor, well, we presented earlier the transition plan when the hearing started, 'no, but just to summarize, it's well, once we are granted of franchise, in good faith we would negotiate with PECO on the purchase of their distribution assets. If there's a failure in that respect, well, there is the imbedded in the franchise, the expropriation. Well, the other option actually is that we can come up in well, as stated earlier, within a year, at least we can come up with our own facilities, Mr. Chair. That in essence are the three points that we've presented earlier. Thank you. [27]\n\nI purposely quoted at length the congressional deliberations to prove that the business plan has all along been to take PECO's properties at all costs since these properties , as cleverly decreed in Section 10 , are those properties \"actually necessary\" for the establishment and operation of MORE's franchise. It has to be that way because petitioner MORE has none of the facilities to distribute electricity to consumers.\n\nExpropriation is a foregone conclusion; it is the only way by which MORE as the new franchisee can establish and operate the distribution of electricity; without expropriation , since PECO is not willing to sell its assets, Iloilo residents will suffer a black-out . The impact of Section 10 and Section 17, as their respective texts prove and as envisioned by the legislators , is to render the condemnation a fait accompli , and the provision on expropriation proceedings a ceremonial procedure .\n\nThat the legislative record reveals much concern about protecting the business of MORE by volunteering the taking of PECO's properties is nothing but consistent with House Bill 8132's conclusion that \" [t]he quality of service of PECO has been wanting Among the complaints against PECO are: overbilling/overcharging, arrogant personnel/poor customer relations, distributor related outages, inadequately maintained lines, inadequate investment in distribution facilities, and inordinate delay in the restoration of power services, among others .\"\n\nPECO's representative was even invited to give a statement on MORE's application for a franchise in what appeared to be a congressional trial of PECO's alleged failings. Apart from the non-renewal of its franchise and the award thereof to MORE , the takeover of PECO's properties by MORE is the legislative punishment for PECO's purported failings.\n\nMORE's business plan and congressional intent are relevant to the conclusion that Sections 10 and 17 are indeed bills of attainder because they follow the template as to why bills of attainer are enacted and why they should be banned . The template has been elucidated as follows:\n\nWe have just seen the danger that arises when a legislature acts in a judicial capacity and enacts bills of attainder to take private property, while simultaneously asserting that its actions are consistent with the law of the land. That discussion was missing only one important ingredient - motive . This section discusses f actions as the motive for legislative defiance of due process . Once the ban on bills of attainder is by far the best aid in understanding why factions are so dangerous.\n\nWhy would a legislature be tempted to defy due process, take property without compensation, and declare that its acts are above judicial review? What possible motive could elected officials have for such misguided behavior? Factions are the answer. For a surprisingly clear statement as to why this is so, we tum to governmental genius James Madison. If anyone understood the workings and dangers of government, he did. Madison directly linked property takings, governmental factions, and rogue legislatures acting in a judicial capacity.\n\nThe occasion for Madison's interweaving of these topics was The Federalist No. 10. This is perhaps the single most famous of the Federalist papers penned by Madison, Hamilton, and Jay, and is best known for discussing the dangers of factions. What is less known is that this essay also related directly to bills of attainder and eminent domain takings as well.\n\nIn the middle of The Federalist No. 10, Madison made the seemingly innocent comment that \"no man is allowed to be a judge in his own cause.\" This seems self-evident. How can a man judge whether he is worthy of punishment? But Madison then took this simple concept one step further and applied it to the workings of government - more specifically, the legislature . He said: \"[A] body of men are unfit to be both judges and parties at the same time; yet what are many of the most important acts of legislation, but so many judicial determinations, not indeed concerning the rights of single persons, but concerning the rights of large bodies of citizens?\" In other words, Madison raised the very point discussed by Webster and Hamilton above. The legislature is tempted constantly to step into the judicial sphere, unless something prevents it from doing so. While Webster and Hamilton spoke in terms of individualized legislation, such as bills of attainder targeted at persons or small groups of people, Madison spread the canvas farther. Was not the same principle true when large groups were targeted for unfair treatment as well? Could not such far-reaching laws also be bills of attainder?\n\nAnd just what were the groups that comprised opposing factions? Madison gave the answer in no uncertain terms: \"The most common and durable source of factions has been the various and unequal distribution of property. Those who hold and those who are without property have ever formed distinct interests in society.\" Madison was no communist, however, and he was not in any way criticizing an unequal distribution of property or asserting that there should be a redistribution of the same to make everyone equal. For him, such a proposition would be impossible, since the acquisition of property was derived from the very unique personalities of individual men. He referred to this concept as \"the diversity in the faculties of men, from which the rights of property originate.\" Then came his key point - that it was the government's job to protect and preserve such individual faculties, which in turn would forever preserve factions :\n\nThe protection of these faculties is the first object of government. From the protection of different and unequal faculties of acquiring property, the possession of different degrees and kinds of property immediately results; and from the influence of these on the sentiments and views of the respective proprietors, ensues a division of the society into different interests and parties.\n\nWhat type of government would preserve property factions as necessary and unavoidable elements of society, while at the same time preventing them from controlling the legislature and exceeding its powers through bills of attainder? A large republic, answered Madison in The Federalist No. 10 - a republic in which small groups of representatives from large and distant population centers would effectively hold each other in check.\n\nOf course, Madison believed that the most effective way the Congress could accomplish this task was through a legislative veto , as he had originally proposed. This legislative veto, however, had been overturned and replaced with a judicial veto over unacceptable state acts, such as the ban on bills of attainder . Madison still hoped and believed that the structure of the federal republic, combined with the limits in Article I, Section 10, would provide the needed protection against factions. He stated in the Federalist No. 44:\n\nBills of attainder, ex-post-facto laws, and laws impairing the obligation of contracts, are contrary to the first principles of the social compact, and to every principle of sound legislation ... Very properly, therefore, has the convention added this constitutional bulwark in favor of personal security and private rights ... The sober people of America are weary of the fluctuating policy which has directed the public councils. They have seen with regret and indignation that sudden changes and legislative interferences , in cases affecting personal rights, become jobs in the hands of enterprising and influential speculators ...\n\nMadison was not the only one who said that the ban on bills of attainder was the chief vehicle to overcome the dangers of factions. Justice Iredell in Minge v. Gilmour said:\n\nIn times of violent faction or confusion of any kind, men are often prompted, if they can, to destroy their adversaries under the color of the law. The numerous acts of attainder in England, and other arbitrary parliamentary punishments, show how necessary it was for a wise people, forming a constitution for themselves, to guard against tyrannies like these.\n\n\u2026.\nIn sum, the greatest fear of the founding generation was that the factions - which are always present in society, and which arise because of unavoidable differences in property ownership - would use the government itself to oppress their fellow citizens. The founders hoped that the nature of America's large republic would overcome this problem. But if the republic failed to do so fully, a very specific ban on egregious, faction-based takings legislation could also be used as a protection. This protection was the ban on bills of attainder. [28]\n\nD. Conclusion\n\nAdmittedly, the use of the ban on bills of attainder as a takings protection has long faded. Nonetheless, it does not need to be that way. As has been said:\n\nThe ban on bills of attainder still stands as a bulwark of liberty to those whose property is arbitrarily taken by an unjustified legislative act. The provision itself has not changed, but only our understanding of it. The provision can protect both persons and groups who for a time are unpopular - such as those of Japanese descent in World War II, suspected communists in the 1950s, or suspected terrorists today - as well as persons or groups that own property the government wants, and then exerts pressure to obtain. Courts today should not be afraid to apply this unique and powerful tool as it was applied in the days of our early history . And when they do, courts will discover that it clarifies many other constitutional principles as well. [29]\n\n[TABLE_CONTENT]\nII. | Sections 10 and 17 violate the equal protection clause.\n[END_TABLE]\n\nII. Sections 10 and 17 violate the equal protection clause.\n\nIn Biraogo v. The Philippine Truth Commission of 2010 , [30] the Court nullified then President Aquino's Executive Order No. 1 creating the Truth Commission and tasking it to investigate reported cases of graft and corruption allegedly committed during the presidency of President Macapagal-Arroyo. The Court held that this executive rule violated the equal protection clause, viz .:\n\nThe equal protection clause is aimed at all official state actions, not just those of the legislature. Its inhibitions cover all the departments of the government including the political and executive departments, and extend to all actions of a state denying equal protection of the laws, through whatever agency or whatever guise is taken.\n\nIt, however, does not require the universal application of the laws to all persons or things without distinction. What it simply requires is equality among equals as determined according to a valid classification. Indeed, the equal protection clause permits classification. Such classification, however, to be valid must pass the test of reasonableness. The test has four requisites: (1) The classification rests on substantial distinctions; (2) It is germane to the purpose of the law; (3) It is not limited to existing conditions only; and (4) It applies equally to all members of the same class. \"Superficial differences do not make for a valid classification.\"\n\nFor a classification to meet the requirements of constitutionality, it must include or embrace all persons who naturally belong to the class....\n\nThe classification must not be based on existing circumstances only, or so constituted as to preclude addition to the number included in the class. It must be of such a nature as to embrace all those who may thereafter be in similar circumstances and conditions. It must not leave out or \"under include\" those that should otherwise fall into a certain classification....\n\nApplying these precepts to this case, Executive Order No. 1 should be struck down as violative of the equal protection clause. The clear mandate of the envisioned truth commission is to investigate and find out the truth \"concerning the reported cases of graft and corruption during the previous administration\" only. The intent to single out the previous administration is plain, patent and manifest . Mention of it has been made in at least three portions of the questioned executive order. Specifically, these are ....\n\nIn this regard, it must be borne in mind that the Arroyo administration is but just a member of a class, that is, a class of past administrations. It is not a class of its own. Not to include past administrations similarly situated constitutes arbitrariness which the equal protection clause cannot sanction. Such discriminating differentiation clearly reverberates to label the commission as a vehicle for vindictiveness and selective retribution.\n\u2026.\nTo reiterate, in order for a classification to meet the requirements of constitutionality, it must include or embrace all persons who naturally belong to the class. \"Such a classification must not be based on existing circumstances only, or so constituted as to preclude additions to the number included within a class , but must be of such a nature as to embrace all those who may thereafter be in similar circumstances and conditions. Furthermore, all who are in situations and circumstances which are relative to the discriminatory legislation and which are indistinguishable from those of the members of the class must be brought under the influence of the law and treated by it in the same way as are the members of the class.\"\n\nHere, Sections 10 and 17 are directed only against respondent PECO . While the language of these provisions may be construed to refer to property owners other than PECO , the congressional deliberations made it very clear and categorical that the take-over is solely with regard to PECO and its properties . The overriding intent is the legislated taking, condemnation of expropriation of PECO's assets and no other entity's properties , because this is petitioner MORE's business plan as it has none of the facilities to establish and operate the distribution of electricity within its franchise area. This is the same evil that Biraogo has railed against, the singling out of a person for the imposition of burdens that and whenever the singled out person is not willing to accept .\n\nIndeed, what differentiates respondent PECO from other property owners? PECO is not the only entity that has \" poles, wires, cables, transformers, switching equipment and stations, buildings, infrastructure, machineries and equipment. \" As admitted by petitioner MORE ,\n\nWell, the other option is definitely MORE Power is ready to build its own distribution assets, 'no. We can provide our own personnel and, well again, as also mentioned during the last, I think, during the last two hearings, 'no, we were saying that personnel is not really that difficult to source, 'no, since it is readily available in the market.\n\n... since I think capital is not a problem for us, if let's say, we're given at least a year, I mean l think we can ... we can actually come up with the system. Because like, let's say, substations, there are mobile standby substations that we can use immediately, deploy immediately while, let's say, building the permanent substations, 'no. So, I guess, again, I mean, since capital is not a problem for us then, I think at least a year would be more or less right. . .\n\nHence, there is no basis for Sections 10 and 17 to single out PECO for the take-over and condemnation of its properties and to drive it altogether from doing other legitimate businesses as regards its assets.\n\n[TABLE_CONTENT]\nIII. | Response to Key Points in the Resolution Denying the Motion for reconsideration.\n[END_TABLE]\n\nIII. Response to Key Points in the Resolution Denying the Motion for reconsideration.\n\nThe reference to an expropriation proceeding now before the trial court strengthens the view that MORE has been true to its business plan of merely taking over PECO's properties to establish, operate and maintain its franchise. The statement that\"[o]wnership was co-existent with the franchise\" further proves that the confiscation of PECO's properties is the Congress' primordial means of supporting MORE's franchise.\n\nIndeed, Congress through Sections 10 and 17 has already determined and settled the issues inherent in an otherwise judicial expropriation proceeding. The court expropriation case has become and will be a fait accompli , a ceremonial figurehead .\n\nAdditionally, the public purpose for the expropriation did not arise because, to quote the ponencia , \"MORE is the new franchise holder in a city whose public space is already burdened by an existing distribution system, and that distribution system cannot continue to serve a public use for it is owned by the old franchise holder.\"\n\nRather , the public use came about because MORE has had none of the facilities and the people to establish, operate and maintain the franchise. The fact that PECO has its facilities in the franchise area does not justify the expropriation, because there would have been no use for these facilities if only MORE has been equipped and skilled to perform the franchise it sought and was awarded .\n\nIt is unfair and out-of-line to turn the tables on PECO when it is MORE that has no equipment and people to make its franchise useful to the people it is intended to serve.\n\nFor clarification, what I claim to be bills of attainder are Section 10 and Section 17 of MORE's franchise, and certainly not the denial of PECO's franchise. The latter is not the subject matter of this case and therefore I cannot have assailed or challenged it in my dissent. In any event, the grant or denial of a franchise begins and ends with Congress \u2013 that is a given.\n\nWhat I point out as bills of attainder are Section 10 and Section 17 RA 11212 , which have burdened PECO with the fait accompli expropriation or taking of its property in a manner that dispenses with the judicial trial on whether public use and public necessity are present in the take-over of PECO properties. Here, it was Congress itself that has become not only the initial but also the final arbiter of what essentially has always been a judicial function .\n\nTo be sure, the denial of PECO's franchise and the grant of franchise to MORE did not have to come with the added burden to PECO of a legislatively determined expropriation of PECO's assets. The two actions are actually separable from each other, and hence, a challenge on the latter does not amount to an attack on the former.\n\nIn any event, there is a huge difference between a consensual acquisition of another's property and a forcible or coercive take-over thereof. The latter is an exercise of State power that the Constitution restrains. While a legislation may authorize its exercise and initially determines the propriety of its exercise, it is a court decree that makes the ultimate lawfully binding determination on the basis of the existence of public use and public necessity and the payment of just compensation. In the case at bar, the process has been skewed because Section 10 and Section 17 of RA 11212 themselves, as confirmed by the legislative deliberations, have adjudged with finality the existence of the elements that should have been the court's prerogative to adjudicate. Even the Court, though it is not the expropriation court, has already found in the present case and on the basis or upon the lead of Section 10 and Section 17, that the take-over is for a public use and publicly necessary.\n\nI agree that \"the power of expropriation is by no means absolute.\" But the power of eminent domain is not only limited by public use and just compensation ; genuine public necessity and the proscription against bills of attainder similarly restrict the exercise of this State power.\n\nI therefore disagree with the thought that \"the Constitution does not sanction the taking of a private [property]\" only if \"the sole purpose\" thereof is to transfer it to another private party. Sole means only, one and only, single, solitary, lone, unique. But then even the confluence of private and public benefits, not solely the conferment of private benefits, may destroy the public use claim of an expropriation \"when the purported public use is merely incidental or pretextual, thereby serving as a guise to favor private interests.\" Clearly , the fact that there is a gloss of public use to a taking does not end the debate simply because it is not the sole purpose of the taking to benefit a private party. The incidental or pretextual public use defense has been explained in this manner:\n\nWhen determining the limits of the government's right to take private property, we will defer to the General [***36] Assembly's exercise of those powers. Id. at 543; SWIDA, 199 Ill. 2d at 236 (\"Great deference should be afforded the legislature and its granting of eminent domain authority.\"). Under SWIDA, that deference evaporates when the public purpose behind the taking is a pretext, when a municipality uses eminent domain as a weapon to forcibly transfer property from one private owner to another . See SWIDA, 199 Ill. 2d at 240 (\"While [SWIDA's] activities here were undertaken in the guise of carrying out its legislated mission, SWIDA's true intentions were not clothed in an independent, legitimate governmental decision to further a planned public use.\"); Kelo v. City of New London, Connecticut , 545 U.S. 469,478, 125 S. Ct. 2655, 162 L. Ed. 2d 439 (2005) (noting government would not be allowed \"to take property under the mere pretext of a public purpose, when its actual purpose was to bestow private benefit .\"); cf. Franco v. National Capital Revitalization Corp ., 930 A.2d 160, 169 (D.C. 2007) (finding \"pretext\" to be valid affirmative defense to condemnation for economic redevelopment).\n\nRecognizing the difference between a valid public use and a sham can be challenging. But a telling feature of sound public use in the context of economic redevelopment is the existence of a well-developed, publicly vetted, and thoughtful economic development plan. Such a plan was present in Kelo , 545 U.S. at 483-84, and Gutknecht, 3 Ill. 2d at 542-43, but absent in SWIDA , 199 Ill. 2d at 240 (\"SWIDA did not conduct or commission [***37] a thorough study of the parking situation at [the racetrack]. Nor did it formulate any economic plan requiring additional parking at the racetrack.\"). A taking will likely pass constitutional muster where done in furtherance of a sound economic development plan, rather than [****432] [**522] the plan retroactively justifying the taking . Cf. Romeo v. Cranston Redevelopment Agency , 105 R.I. 651, 254 A.2d 426, 433 (R.I. 1969) (\"governing bodies must either plan for the development or redevelopment of urban areas or permit them to become more congested, deteriorated, obsolescent, unhealthy, stagnant, inefficient and costly\" (internal quotation marks omitted)). [31]\n\nAs has been copiously quoted and also explained at length, MORE's business plan from the beginning has been to take over PECO's properties. There was no well-developed, publicly vetted, and thoughtful plan as the idea was simply to take and justify this taking by retroactively referring to MORE's business plan of simply taking over PECO's properties.\n\nIn Southwestern Ill. Dev. Auth. v. Nat'l City Envtl., L.L.C. , [32] a government agency sought to expropriate private parcels of land to be conveyed to a private race track which would then build additional parking spaces for its clientele. The court ruled that the public benefits arising from the parking spaces were merely incidental and pretextual to the profit motivation of the private race track. Thus:\n\nIf this taking were allowed to stand, it may be true that spectators at Gateway would benefit greatly. Developing additional parking could benefit the members of the public who choose to attend events at the racetrack, as spectators may often have to wait in long lines of traffic to park their vehicles and again to depart the facility. We also acknowledge that a public use or purpose may be satisfied in light of public safety concerns. See Illinois Toll Highway Comm'n v. Eden Cemetery Ass'n , 16 Ill. 2d 539, 158 N.E.2d 766 (1959). The public is allowed to park on the property in exchange for the payment of a fee. Gateway's racetrack may be open to the public, but not \"by right.\" Gaylord, 204 Ill. at 584. It is a private venture designed to [*239] result not in a public use, but in private profits . If this taking were permitted, lines to enter parking lots might be shortened and pedestrians might [***21] be able to cross from parking areas to event areas in a safer manner. However , we are unpersuaded that these facts alone are sufficient to satisfy the public use requirement , especially in light of evidence that Gateway could have built a parking garage structure on its existing property .\n\nWe have also recognized that economic development is an important public purpose . See People ex rel. City of Canton v. Crouch , 79 Ill. 2d 356, 38 Ill. Dec. 154, 403 N.E.2d 242 (1980); People ex rel. City of Urbana v. Paley , 68 Ill. 2d 62, 11 Ill. Dec. 307, 368 N.E.2d 915 (1977); People ex rel. City of Salem v. McMackin , 53 Ill. 2d 347, 291 N.E.2d 807 (1972). SWIDA presented extensive testimony that expanding Gateway's facilities through the taking of NCE's property would allow it to grow and prosper and contribute to positive economic growth in the region. However, \"incidentally, every lawful business does this. \" Gaylord, 204 Ill. at 586. Moreover, nearly a century ago, Gaylord expressed the long-standing rule that \"to constitute a public use, something more than a mere benefit to the public must flow from the contemplated improvement . [***22] \"Gaylord, 204 Ill. at 584.\n\nThis case is strikingly similar to our earlier decision in Limits Industrial R.R. Co. v. American Spiral Pipe Works , 321 Ill. 101, 151 N .E. 567 (1926). In Limits Industrial, this court held that a railroad could not exercise eminent domain authority to acquire property for the purpose of expanding its facilities. Despite a certificate of convenience and necessity issued by the Illinois Commerce Commission, we found the proposed spur track and public [**10] [****250] freight house provided minimal public benefit and principally benefitted the railroad itself and a few other business entities . Limits Industrial, 321 Ill. at 109-10. Similarly, it is incumbent upon us to question SWIDA's findings as to the parking situation at Gateway and determine whether [*240] the true beneficiaries of this taking are private businesses and not the public .\n\nWe do not require a bright-line test to find that this taking bestows a purely private benefit and lacks a showing of a supporting legislative purpose. As was the case in Limits Industrial, members of the public are not the primary intended beneficiaries of this taking . Limits Industrial, 321 Ill. at 109-10. [***23] This condemnation clearly was intended to assist Gateway in accomplishing their goals in a swift, economical, and profitable manner.\n\nEntities such as SWIDA must always be mindful of expediency, cost efficiency, and profitability while accepting the legislature's charge to promote development within their defined parameters. However, these goals must not be allowed to overshadow the constitutional principles that lie at the heart of the power with which SWIDA and similar entities have been entrusted. As Justice Kuehn stated in dissent in the appellate court, \"If property ownership is to remain what our forefathers intended it to be, if it is to remain a part of the liberty we cherish, the economic by-products of a private capitalist's ability to develop land cannot justify a surrender of ownership to eminent domain .\" 304 Ill. App. 3d at 556 (Kuehn, J., specially concurring).\n\nWhile the activities here were undertaken in the guise of carrying out its legislated mission, SWIDA's true intentions were not clothed in an independent, legitimate governmental decision to further a planned public use. SWIDA did not conduct or commission a thorough study of the parking situation [***24] at Gateway. Nor did it formulate any economic plan requiring additional parking at the racetrack. SWIDA advertised that, for a fee, it would condemn land at the request of \"private developers\" for the \"private use\" of developers. In addition, SWIDA entered into a contract with Gateway to condemn whatever land \"may be desired ***by Gateway.\" Clearly, [*241] the foundation of this taking is rooted not in the economic and planning process with which SWIDA has been charged. Rather, this action was undertaken solely in response to Gateway's expansion goals and its failure to accomplish those goals through purchasing NCE's land at an acceptable negotiated price. It appears SWIDA's true intentions were to act as a default broker of land for Gateway's proposed parking plan.\n\nThis point is further emphasized by the fact that other options were available to Gateway that could have addressed many of the problems testified to by Pritchett, Ortbals and others. Gateway could have built a parking garage structure on its existing property rather than develop the land owned by NCE. However, when Gateway discovered that the cost of constructing a garage on land it already owned was substantially higher than [***25] using SWIDA as its agent to take NCE's property for open-field parking, Gateway chose the easier and less expensive avenue.\n\nAs a result of the acquisition of NCE's property, Gateway could realize an estimated increase of $ 13 to $ 14 million in projected revenue per year. While we do not deny that this expansion in revenue could potentially trickle down and bring corresponding revenue increases to the region, revenue expansion alone does not justify an improper and unacceptable expansion [**11] [****251] of the eminent domain power of the government. Using the power of the government for purely private purposes to allow Gateway to avoid the open real estate market and expand its facilities in a more cost-efficient manner, and thus maximizing corporate profits, is a misuse of the power entrusted by the public.\n\nThe legislature intended that SWIDA actively foster economic development and expansion in Madison and St. Clair Counties. 70 ILCS 520/2(g), 5 (West 1998). However, the actions of SWlDA in this case blur the lines between [*242] a public use and a private purpose. A highway toll authority may justify the use of eminent domain to ensure that motorists have reasonable access [***26] to gas stations. Illinois Toll Highway Comm'n, 16 Ill. 2d at 546. Does the highway authority's power include the ability to use eminent domain authority to take additional land for a car wash, and then a lube shop? Could the authority then use its power to facilitate additional expansions for a motel, small retail shops, and entertainment centers? The initial, legitimate development of a public project does not justify condemnation for any and all related business expansions.\n\nSWIDA contends that the \"wisdom *** of the legislation and 'the means of executing the project' are beyond judicial scrutiny 'once the public purpose has been established.' It is that purpose which controls and not the 'means' or 'mechanics' of how the purpose is carried out.\" We disagree. The Constitution and the essential liberties we are sworn to protect control. In its wisdom, the legislature has given SWIDA the authority to use eminent domain power to encourage private enterprise and become involved in commercial projects that may benefit a specific region of this state. While we do not question the legislature's discretion in allowing for the exercise of eminent domain power, \"the government [***27] does not have unlimited power to redefine property rights.\" Loretto v. Teleprompter Manhattan CATV Corp ., 458 U.S. 419, 439, 73 L. Ed. 2d 868, 885, 102 S. Ct. 3164, 3178 (1982). The power of eminent domain is to be exercised with restraint, not abandon.\n\nHere, Sections 10 and 17 have become the default broker for MORE . The latter could have discovered that the cost of building facilities for the distribution of electricity was substantially higher than using these assailed provisions as its agent to take PECO's properties. MORE chose the easier and less expensive avenue to exercise its franchise.\n\nThe actual purpose for the expropriation of PECO's properties has been to bestow a private benefit on MORE's exercise of its franchise that it could not have fulfilled otherwise. But for MORE's inability to provide the facilities and technical knowhow to establish and operate its franchise, and MORE's ultimate business plan to take-over and raid PECO's facilities, the expropriation of PECO's properties would not have come to pass and would not have been made necessary. Verily, Sections 10 and 17 have been meant to operationalize a business plan to benefit a particular class of identifiable individuals \u2013 MORE . In relation to this, PECO has been singled out with the expropriation of its properties without a judicial trial.\n\nIt is the opinion of the majority that under Sections 10 and 17 the expropriation of PECO's properties \u2013 including, but not limited to its poles, wires, cables, transformers, switching equipment and stations, buildings, infrastructure, machineries and equipment \u2013 is intended for public use and demanded by public necessity. With this determination, what else are we to expect from the lower court hearing the expropriation proceedings? This confirms what I have been saying all along that PECO has been singled out and punished for its alleged poor services through the take-over of its properties whose validity and legitimacy have been settled by legislative fiat through Sections 10 and 17.\n\nACCORDINGLY , I vote to GRANT the Motion for reconsideration of Panay Electric Company, Inc. and REINSTATE the trial court's Judgment dated July 1, 2019, declaring Sections 10 and 17 of Republic Act No. 11212 UNCONSTITUTIONAL for being bills of attainder and for being violative of the equal protection clause.\n\n[1] 651 Phil. 374 (2010).\n\n[2] United States v.

April 4, 2002).\n\nCONCURRING OPINION\n\nINTING, J .:\n\nI am reconsidering my vote in the Decision [1] dated September 1 2020 and find that Sections 10 and 17 of Republic Act No. (RA) 11212 [2] which grant MORE Electric and Power Corporation (MORE) the right of eminent domain are constitutional.\n\nSections 1 0 and 17 of RA 11212 provide:\n\nSECTION 10. Right of Eminent Domain. \u2014 Subject to the limitations and procedures prescribed by law, the grantee is authorized to exercise the power of eminent domain insofar as it may be reasonably necessary for the efficient establishment, improvement, upgrading, rehabilitation, maintenance and operation of its services . The grantee is authorized to install and maintain its poles wires, and other facilities over, under, and across public property, including streets, highways, parks, and other similar property of the Government of the Philippines, its branches, or any of its instrumentalities. The grantee may acquire such private property as is actually necessary for the realization of the purposes for which this franchise is granted, including, but not limited to poles, wires, cables, transformers, switching equipment and stations, buildings, infrastructure, machineries and equipment previously, currently or actually used, or intended to be used, or have been abandoned, unused or underutilized, or which obstructs its facilities, for the operation of a distribution system for the conveyance of electric power to end users in its franchise area: Provided , That proper expropriation proceedings shall have been instituted and just compensation paid.\n\nProvided, further , That upon the filing of the petition for expropriation, or at any time thereafter, and after due notice to the owner of the property to be expropriated and the deposit in a bank located in the franchise area of the full amount of the assessed value of the property or properties, the grantee shall be entitled to immediate possession, operation, control, use and disposition of the properties sought to be expropriated, including the power of demolition, if necessary, notwithstanding the pendency of other issues before the court, including the final determination of the amount of just compensation to be paid. The court may appoint a representative from the ERC as a trial commissioner in determining the amount of just compensation. The court may consider the tax declarations, current audited financial statements, and rate-setting applications of the owner or owners of the property or properties being expropriated in order to determine their assessed value.\n\nx x x x\n\nSECTION 17. Transition of Operations . \u2014 In the public interest and to ensure uninterrupted supply of electricity, the current operator, Panay Electric Company, Inc. (PECO), shall in the interim be authorized to operate the existing distribution system within the franchise area, as well as implement its existing power supply agreements with generation companies that had been provisionally or finally approved by the ERC until the establishment or acquisition by the grantee of its own distribution system and its complete transition towards full operations as determined by the ERC, which period shall m no case exceed two (2) years from the grant of this legislative franchise.\n\nUpon compliance with its rules, the ERC shall grant PECO the necessary provisional certificate of public convenience and necessity (CPCN) covering such interim period. The applicable generation rate shall be the provisional or final rate approved by ERC.\n\nThis provisional authority to operate during the transition period shall not be construed as extending the franchise of PECO after its expiration on January 18, 2019, and it shall not prevent the grantee from exercising the right of eminent domain over the distribution assets existing at the franchise area as provided in Section 10 of this Act. During such interim period, the ERC shall require PECO to settle the full amount which ERC has directed to refund to its customers in connection with all the cases filed against it. x x x x (Italics in the original and supplied.)\n\nEminent domain is defined as \"the power of the nation or a sovereign state to take, or to authorize the taking of, private property for a public use without the owner's consent, conditioned upon payment of just compensation.\" [3]\n\nThe power of eminent domain is exercised by Congress. However, as cited in the ponencia , the Court discussed in Manapat v. Court of Appeals [4] that Congress which possesses the power of eminent domain may delegate such power to the President, administrative bodies, local government units and even to private enterprises performing public services . By way of a footnote to this discussion, the Court explained that \"[u]nder existing laws, quasi-public corporations such as the Philippine National Railways, the PLDT and Meralco have been granted the power of expropriation.\" [5]\n\nFurther, the exercise of the power of eminent domain is subject to limitations under the 1987 Constitution, i.e .: (1) that private property shall not be taken for public use without just compensation as provided in Section 9, Article III; and (2) that no person shall be deprived of his/her life, liberty, or property without due process of law as provided in Section 1, Article III. [6]\n\nGuided by this discussion, I find that the delegation of the power of eminent domain in favor of MORE under Sections 10 and 17 of RA 11212 is constitutional for the following reasons:\n\nFirst , as discussed by the ponencia , MORE is a private enterprise allowed by Congress to operate a public utility for public interest. Specifically, MORE was granted a franchise for the purpose of \"establish[ing], operat[ing], and maintain[ing], for commercial purposes, and in the public interest, a distribution system for the conveyance of electric power to end users in the City of Iloilo.\" [7] Thus, Congress may delegate to MORE the right of eminent domain in such a manner that the delegation will not violate the constitutional safeguards for the taking of private property for public use.\n\nSecond , the delegation by Congress of the power of eminent domain to MORE is for a public use. It must be emphasized that \"[p]ublic use, as an eminent domain concept, has acquired an expansive meaning to include utility, advantage or productivity for the benefit of the public. [8] Here, without doubt, the continuous and uninterrupted distribution of electric power in Iloilo City will ultimately be of utility, advantage or productivity to Iloilo City's general public.\n\nAs emphasized by Associate Justice Alfredo Benjamin S. Caguioa in his Separate Opinion to the Decision in this case, PECO is the sole operator of the electric power distribution utility in Iloilo City, a situation which is typical in the industry as the energy sector has always been a natural monopoly given the extremely high fixed costs involved. [9] With the non-renewal of PECO's franchise, a decision which is solely within the prerogative of Congress, MORE, the new franchisee must be given reasonable means to establish its service to ensure the continuous supply of electric power in Iloilo City. To my mind, the delegation of the power of eminent domain to MORE which includes the right 'to immediately possess and take over PECO's property/ies upon deposit of the assessed value of the property/ies, among other requirements, is reasonable considering that MORE is a newcomer in the industry. As aptly explained by the Court, speaking through Associate Justice Jose C. Reyes, Jr. in the Decision in this case, \"MORE is x x x peculiarly and doubly burdened. It must not only supply electricity, it must also prevent any disruption that might arise from its takeover of the franchise.\" [10]\n\nI share the view of Associate Justice Alfredo Benjamin S. Caguioa that the \"Congress should not be deprived of the authority to grant new franchise holders with the power to expropriate necessary assets. To hold otherwise would effectively constrain Congress to continuously renew the existing franchise of the current operator despite its sub-par service, until another prospective operator has built its own capital assets.\" [11] And yet given the high fixed costs and other barriers to entry, a new prospective operator might be discouraged from building its own capital assets as there is even no guarantee that Congress will grant a franchise in its favor. [12]\n\nThird , I concur with the ponencia that the incidental benefit enjoyed by MORE does not render its legislative franchise unconstitutional. Such incidental benefit to MORE does not outweigh and by no means negate the benefit that will inure to the entire population of Iloilo City if MORE's power of eminent domain under Sections 10 and 17 will be upheld. Surely, the \"prevent[ion] [of] massive and prolonged economic disruption in the city, not to mention oppressive discomfort by its residents\" should not be frustrated just because of some incidental benefit that would inure to MORE. [13]\n\nFourth , the grant of the power of eminent domain to MORE under Sections 10 and 17 of RA 11212 does not amount to deprivation of property without due process of law. Sections 10 and 17 are not confiscatory as they do not provide for the automatic taking of PECO's property/properties without the conduct of the proper judicial proceedings for expropriation. What is evident from Section 10 is that MORE must initiate the proper expropriation proceedings in the exercise of its power of eminent domain.\n\nExpropriation consists of two stages. The Court discussed in National Power Corporation v. Posada, et al. : [14]\n\nx x x The first is concerned with the determination of the authority of the plaintiff to exercise the power of eminent domain and the propriety of its exercise in the context of the facts involved in the suit. It ends with an order, if not of dismissal of the action, \"of condemnation declaring that the plaintiff has a lawful right to take the property sought to be condemned, for the public use or purpose described in the complaint, upon the payment of just compensation to be determined as of the date of the filing of the complaint.\" x x x\n\nThe second phase of the eminent domain action is concerned with the determination by the Court of \"the just compensation for the property sought to be taken.\" This is done by the Court with the assistance of not more than three (3) commissioners. x x x [15] (Italics in the original.)\n\nSection 10 in particular does not render the first stage of the expropriation proceedings inutile. Associate Justice Estela M. Perlas-Bernabe aptly discussed in her Separate Opinion to the Decision in this case that \"the grant of the authority to expropriate is different from the propriety of the expropriation itself.\" Specifically, the present case \"only concerns the issue of constitutionality of Sections 10 and 17 of RA 11212 which provisions must be examined against the prevailing jurisprudential standard that public use is equal to 'whatever is beneficially employed for the general welfare.\"' I am of the same view that the issue of whether the power of eminent domain is properly exercised by MORE as to PECO's specific property/ies is the subject matter of the appropriate expropriation proceedings. [16]\n\nFurther, as aptly pointed out by Associate Justice Alfredo Benjamin S. Caguioa, Section 10 expressly provides that the authority of MORE to exercise the power of eminent domain is subject to the limitations and procedures prescribed by law. Specifically, Section 10 sets out a restriction on expropriation, i.e ., \"insofar as maybe necessary for the efficient establishment, improvement, upgrading, rehabilitation, maintenance and operation of [MORE's] services.\" [17] Thus, in the appropriate expropriation proceedings, MORE still has the burden to establish that the property sought to be condemned is for the specific public use or purpose embodied in RA 11212.\n\nThe non-confiscatory nature of Section 10 is also highlighted by the fact that the provision does not do away with the second stage of the expropriation proceedings, i.e. , the determination of just compensation which essentially belongs to the Courts. [18]\n\nJust compensation has been defined by the Court as \"the full and fair equivalent of the property taken from its owner by the expropriator. The measure is not the taker's gain, but the owner's loss.\" [19] Further, \"[t]he word 'just' is used to qualify the meaning of the word 'compensation' and to convey thereby the idea that the amount to be tendered for the property to be taken shall be real, substantial, full and ample.\" [20]\n\nIt must be emphasized that the deposit of the assessed value of the property/ies as provided in Section 10 is merely preliminary and does not constitute the totality of the compensation to be received by PECO in the event of expropriation of its property/ies by MORE. It is also not meant to substitute the fair market value that the Government is supposed to pay to PECO under Section 4 [21] of PECO's franchise, i.e ., RA 5360, [22] in the event that the Government should desire to operate and maintain for itself PECO's system and enterprise.\n\nNotably, the deposit of the assessed value as a requirement for the possession of the property/ies is not novel to RA 11212 as it is similar with Rule 67 of the Rules of Court which governs expropriation proceedings. [23] Section 2, Rule 67 provides:\n\nSEC. 2. Entry of plaintiff upon depositing value with authorized government depositary . \u2014 Upon the filing of the complaint or at any time thereafter and after due notice to the defendant, the plaintiff shall have the right to take or enter upon he possession of the real property involved if he deposits with the authorized government depositary an amount equivalent to the assessed value of the property for purposes of taxation to be held by such bank subject to the orders of the court. Such deposit shall be in money, unless in lieu thereof the court authorizes the deposit of a certificate of deposit of a government bank of the Republic of the Philippines payable on demand to the authorized government depositary.\n\nx x x x (Italics supplied.)\n\nAfter the deposit of the assessed value to a bank located in the franchise area as provided in Section 10 of RA 11212, the expropriation proceedings must continue. Consistent with the constitutional requirement for the payment of just compensation in case of taking of a private property for public use, Section 10 of RA 11212 expressly provides for the need to pay just compensation to the owner deprived of property/ies. Thus, in the event of a finding by the trial court that MORE has a lawful right to take the specific property/ies of PECO, MORE must still pay PECO just compensation based on the court's determination coupled with legal interest thereon from the time of taking of the property/ies. [24]\n\nAll told, I find that the delegation of the power of eminent domain to MORE under Sections 10 and 17 of RA 11212 is for a public use and does not constitute d privation of property without due process of law.\n\nGiven the foregoing, I concur with the ponencia and vote to DENY the motion for reconsideration.\n\n[1] MORE Electric and Power Corporation v.

Rep. of the Phils., supra note 18 at 1064.\n\nDISSENTING OPINION\n\nDELOS SANTOS, J .:\n\nUpon careful review of the merits of the present Motion for Reconsideration and with the indulgence of my colleagues, the honorable Members of the Court, I most respectfully change my vote from the 15 September 2020 Decision of the Court and join the dissenting opinion of Associate Justice Marvic Mario Victor F. Leonen (Justice Leonen). Considering the substantive arguments raised in the Motion for Reconsideration, I agree with Justice Leonen that Sections 10 and 17 of Republic Act No. (RA) 11212 [1] must be struck down by the Court as unconstitutional. The said provisions are clearly beyond the scope of the State's power of eminent domain. Glaringly, the taking of respondent Panay Electric Company, Inc.'s (PECO) assets by petitioner More Electric Power Corporation (MORE) through the State's power of eminent domain effectively amounts to the taking of private property not for a public purpose but for private gain.\n\nRA 11212 granted petitioner MORE a franchise to establish, operate, and maintain an electric power distribution system in Iloilo City. Section 10 of RA 11212 provides for the exercise of the right of eminent domain in favor of MORE, to wit:\n\nSection 10. Right of Eminent Domain . \u2013 Subject to the limitations and procedures prescribed by law, the grantee is authorized to exercise the power of eminent domain insofar as it may be reasonably necessary for the efficient establishment, improvement, upgrading, rehabilitation, maintenance and operation of its services. The grantee is authorized to install and maintain its poles wires, and other facilities over, under, and across public property, including streets, highways, parks, and other similar property of the Government of the Philippines, its branches, or any of its instrumentalities. The grantee may acquire such private property as is actually necessary for the realization of the purposes for which this franchise is granted, including, but not limited to poles, wires, cables, transformers, switching equipment and stations, buildings, infrastructure, machineries and equipment previously, currently or actually used, or intended to be used, or have been abandoned, unused or underutilized, or which obstructs its facilities, for the operation of a distribution system for the conveyance of electric power to end users in its franchise area: Provided , That proper expropriation proceedings shall have been instituted and just compensation paid:\n\nProvided, further , That upon the filing of the petition for expropriation, or at any time thereafter, and after due notice to the owner of the property to be expropriated and the deposit in a bank located in the franchise area of the full amount of the assessed value of the property or properties, the grantee shall be entitled to immediate possession, operation, control, use and disposition of the properties sought to be expropriated, including the power of demolition, if necessary, notwithstanding the pendency of other issues before the court, including the final determination of the amount of just compensation to be paid. The court may appoint a representative from the ERC as a trial commissioner in determining the amount of just compensation. The court may consider the tax declarations, current audited financial statements, and rate-setting applications of the owner or owners of the property or properties being expropriated in order to determine their assessed value.\n\nThe ponencia claims that Sections 10 and 17 of RA 11212 constitutes a valid exercise of the State's power of eminent domain. The ponencia reasons that the general consideration of public use is \"whatever is beneficially employed for the general welfare.\" As applied in the present case, the ponencia posits that the law is undoubtedly for the general purpose of electricity distribution and, thus, satisfies the requirement of public use. Moreover, the ponencia reasons that Sections 10 and 17 ensure uninterrupted supply of electricity in the city during the transition period from the old to the new franchisee, from PECO to MORE, respectively.\n\nI most respectfully disagree.\n\nSection 9, Article III of the 1987 Constitution states:\n\nSection 9. Private property shall not be taken for public use without just compensation . (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)\n\nThe power of eminent domain is an inherent power of the State. The power gives the State the authority to forcibly take private property provided the taking of private property is: (1) for a public purpose ; and (2) upon payment of just compensation. [2] In a long line of cases, the Court has consistently held that the power of eminent domain must be solely or exclusively exercised for a public purpose . Section 9, Article III, thus, acts as a restraint on the State's expansive power of eminent domain . [3] In Provincial Bus Operators Association of the Philippines v. Department of Labor and Employment , [4] the Court held that property due process undoubtedly involves the promotion of stability of ownership over private property. [5] Verily, without such restrictions on the State's power of eminent domain, the State could then arbitrarily confiscate privately-owned property without due process.\n\nRevisiting Justice Leonen's dissenting opinion in the 15 September 2020 Decision of the Court, he cited the evolving definition of \"public use,\" in the wise:\n\nIn its traditional and literal sense \"public use\" means \"public employment or the actual use by the public.\" There is no question that the taking of private property for the building of roads, schools, or hospitals for the use of the public falls under this notion of actual use. \"Public use,\" however, evolved to mean \"public purpose,\" \"public advantage or benefit,\" and even \"public welfare.\" It is under this expanded meaning of public use that expropriations for agrarian reform and urban development were allowed by this Court.\n\nx x x x\n\nIt is settled that the business of electricity distribution is for a public purpose and is imbued with public interest. It is for this reason that the operation of an electricity distribution system requires a national franchise from Congress.\n\nHowever, if the private property is taken for the same public use as to which the property was originally devoted, how the expropriator will serve the public purpose better than the former owner should be examined. For if the public is not better off with the taking of the property, then there is no true expropriation. There is only transfer of property from one entity to another. All the exercise of eminent domain results in is a change in the \"application of profits,\" directly serving proprietary interests. Any public benefit is only pretended or, at best, incidental. [6] (Emphasis supplied)\n\nLikewise, in Justice Leonen's dissenting opinion in the Motion for Reconsideration brought before the Court, he reiterates his position and cites the Court's Decision in Se\u00f1a v. Manila Railroad Co. and Insular Government [7] in that true expropriation implies a new public purpose, to wit:\n\nNevertheless, if property is taken for the same public use to which it was originally devoted, there is no true expropriation. As early as 1921, this Court in Se\u00f1a v. Manila Railroad Co. and Insular Government noted how the meaning of the term 'public use' [is] one of constant growth and that [a]s society advances, its demands upon the individual increase and each demand is a new use to which the resources of the individual may be devoted . This implies that a true expropriation requires a new public use.\n\nIndeed, if property is taken then subsequently devoted to the same public use, there is only a transfer of property from one entity to another. All the exercise of eminent domain results in is a change as to who gets the profits. Therefore, the taking primarily serves proprietary interests, with little if no regard as to the interests of the public. Any public interest is only pretended or, at best, incidental. [8]\n\nIn relation to the term \"public use,\" the Court must be guided by Justice Sandra Day O'Connor's dissenting opinion in Kelo v. The City of New London . [9] In her strong dissent, Justice O'Connor explained the dangerous precedent the US Supreme Court may cause if the US Court would expand the definition of \"public use\" to accommodate private interests, to wit:\n\nIn moving away from our decisions sanctioning the condemnation of harmful property use, the Court today significantly expands the meaning of public use. It holds that the sovereign may take private property currently put to ordinary private use, and give it over for new, ordinary private use, so long as the new use is predicted to generate some secondary benefit for the public \u2013 such as increased tax revenue, more jobs, maybe even aesthetic pleasure. But nearly any lawful use of real private property can be said to generate some incidental benefit to the public. Thus, if predicted (or even guaranteed) positive side-effects are enough to render transfer from one private party to another constitutional, then the words \"for public use\" do not realistically exclude any takings, and thus do not exert any constraint on the eminent domain power.\n\nThere is a sense in which this troubling result follows from errant language in Berman and Midkiff . In discussing whether takings within a blighted neighborhood were for a public use, Berman began by observing: \"We deal, in other words, with what traditionally has been known as the police power.\" 348 U.S., at 32. From there it declared that \"[o]nce the object is within the authority of Congress, the right to realize it through the exercise of eminent domain is clear.\" Id. , at 33. Following up, we said in Midkiff that \"[t]he 'public use' requirement is coterminous with the scope of a sovereign's police powers.\" 467 U.S., at 240. This language was unnecessary to the specific holdings of those decisions. Berman and Midkiff simply did not put such language to the constitutional test, because the takings in those cases were within the police power but also for \"public use\" for the reasons I have described. The case before us now demonstrates why, when deciding if a taking's purpose is constitutional, the police power and \"public use\" cannot always be equated. [10] (Emphasis and underscoring supplied)\n\nIn the present case, upon careful review of PECO's Motion for Reconsideration, I find that the taking of PECO's property does not amount to a legitimate public purpose and, hence, is not a proper subject of the exercise of the State's power of eminent domain. Firstly , under the facts presented, MORE has no basic qualifications, much less experience, in electricity distribution. Secondly , MORE clearly does not have assets of its own. MORE will undoubtedly depend on the transfer of PECO's assets to create an electricity distribution system. In fact, during the Congressional debates on MORE's franchise application, the Lower House conceded that MORE will solely rely on PECO's assets for the effective distribution of electricity in Iloilo City. Thirdly , the taking of PECO's private property will undoubtedly foster a monopoly in the electricity distribution system in Iloilo City. Fourthly , the taking of PECO's assets ipso facto amounts to the transfer of property from one entity to another and a mere appropriation of profits, directly serving MORE's proprietary interests . Fifth , there is no direct public good that can be derived from the exercise of the power of eminent domain . The benefit or welfare of the people is only incidental to the exercise of the power. The sole primary benefactor remains to be MORE. Sixth , the mere fact that Sections 10 and 1 7 ensure uninterrupted supply of electricity in Iloilo City during the transition period from PECO to MORE should not be honored as strong evidence of public use. The flawed reasoning suggests that as long as there is no interruption in the service of electricity then the exercise of the power of eminent domain could be justified. In addition, such statement cannot be guaranteed by the Court since it has been established that MORE has no experience whatsoever in electricity distribution. To repeat, incidental public benefit cannot justify the exercise of the State's power of eminent domain.\n\nAll things considered, the Court has the primordial duty to abolish laws passed by the legislative that amount to the taking of property exclusively for private gain or laws that promote the facilitation of a monopolistic system. Conceivably, it will be the Filipino people who will bear the brunt of these arbitrary and confiscatory laws like Sections 10 and 17 of RA 11212. Ultimately, to uphold the validity of Sections 10 and 17 of RA 11212 is to sanction a clear violation of the 1987 Constitution, PECO's rights to property due process, and the people of Iloilo City's right to the efficient and effective access to proper electricity distribution.\n\nACCORDINGLY , I vote to DECLARE Sections 10 and 17 of Republic Act No. 11212 as unconstitutional.\n\n[1] An Act Granting More Electric and Power Corporation a Franchise to Establish, Operate, and Maintain, for Commercial Purposes and in the Public Interest, a Distribution System for the Conveyance of Electric Power to the End Users in the City of Iloilo, Province of Iloilo, and Ensuring the Continuous and Uninterrupted Supply of Electricity in the Franchise Area; approved on February 14, 2019.\n\n[2] Mactan-Cebu International Airport Authority v.

      "title": "GENOVEVA S. SUAREZ, PETITIONER, VS. PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES AND THE BUREAU OF INTERNAL REVENUE, RESPONDENTS.D E C I S I O N CARANDANG, J.: Before this Court is a Petition for Review on Certiorari[1] under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court assailing the Decision[2] dated November 19, 2019 and Resolution dated September 1, 2020 rendered by the Court of Tax Appeals (CTA) En Banc in CTA EB Crim. Case No. 066, which affirmed the conviction of Genoveva S. Suarez (petitioner), as Executive Vice-President of 21st Century Entertainment, Inc. (21st Century), for violation of Section 255 in relation to Sections 253(d) and 256 of the National Internal Revenue Code (NIRC) or the failure of 21st Century to pay its tax liabilities.Facts of the CaseOn August 21, 2008, the Office of the City Prosecutor of Manila filed an Information against petitioner for violation of Section 255, in relation to Sections 253(d) and 256 of the NIRC, committed as follows:That on or about January 23, 2004, and continuously up to present, in the City of Manila, Philippines, the said accused being then the President of 21st CENTURY ENTERTAINMENT, INC. with business address at Room 207 Tiaoqui Bldg., Sta. Cruz, Manila, and therefore the responsible officer of the said Corporation, to whom notices and demands were made by the Bureau of Internal Revenue, represented in this case by ATTY. HABARI LUCMAN BALT, to pay the Corporation's overdue tax obligations amounting to PhP747,964.49 under BIR Assessment Notice No. 31-2000, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and knowingly fail, refuse and neglect to pay the Bureau of Internal Revenue the said amount of PhP747,964.49 despite due notice and demand without formally protesting and appealing the same with the proper authority, to the damage and prejudice of the Government of the Republic of the Philippines sin (sic) the same sum of PhP747,964.49, Philippine currency.CONTRARY TO LAW.[3]On February 4, 2009, petitioner pleaded not guilty to the offense charged. During pre-trial, the prosecution and defense stipulated that petitioner is the Executive Vice-President of 21st Century at the time of the assessment.[4]As culled from the records of this case, the facts are as follows:On January 23, 2004, the Commissioner of Internal Revenue (CIR) issued Final Assessment Notices (FANs) and Final Letters of Demand (FLDs) to 21st Century, demanding payment for deficiency income tax, improperly accumulated earnings tax, minimum corporate income tax, expanded withholding tax, value-added tax, and compromise penalty, in the aggregate amount of P747,964.49 for taxable year 2000.[5]On February 26, 2004, 21st Century, represented by its Vice-President, John S. Suarez, filed a Protest against the FLDs and requested the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) for reinvestigation of the assessment issued against it. However, on December 5, 2005, the case docket of 21st Century was forwarded to the Chief Collection Division, for collection of the deficiency taxes because of 21st Century's failure to submit within 60 days from date of protest supporting documents to refute the assessment.[6]On December 19, 2005, the Revenue District Officer (RDO) issued the First Notice of Delinquent Account to 21st Century requiring it to settle its tax deficiencies. The RDO warned 21st Century that in case of failure to settle its tax obligations, the case shall be referred to the BIR legal division for appropriate action. On January 3, 2006, the RDO issued a Second Notice of Delinquent Account against 21st Century, informing the latter that the case has been referred to the BIR Legal Division. The RDO likewise reiterated that 21st Century should pay its tax deficiencies to avoid the issuance of a Warrant of Distraint and/or Levy (WDL) or Garnishment. Despite the foregoing notices, 21st Century still failed to settle its obligations; hence, on March 17, 2006, the BIR issued a Final Notice before Seizure addressed to Richard Suarez.[7]On August 24, 2006, in a bid to prevent the seizure of 2st Century's properties, petitioner sent a Letter to the RDO requesting additional time to secure the services of an external accountant to assist 21st Century in organizing its accounting records so that it could provide the BIR evidence supporting its financial statements and income tax returns Petitioner also expressed her willingness to settle 21st Century's tax liabilities, through compromise.[8] Despite this, the CIR, on November 28, 2006, issued a WDL against 21st Century.[9]On March 7, 2007, the BIR issued a Warrant of Garnishment to Equitable-PCI Bank against the account of 21st Century, to no avail. Hence, on May 28, 2007, the RDO issued a Memorandum recommending the filing of proper case against 21st Century for failure to pay its delinquent tax liabilities.[10]During the trial, the prosecution presented Ma. Paz Arcilla (Arcilla), Armando Macatangay (Macatangay) and Dionisio Singson (Singson) as its witnesses.Arcilla, a revenue officer of the BIR, testified that she supervises the preparation, issuance, and monitoring of demand letters, final assessments, and transcripts of assessments of tax cases. According to her, the original copies of the assessment notices and formal letters of demand were sent to the registered address of 21st Century and the same were duly received by 21st Century as evidenced by their filing of a protest letter to the FAN.[11]Macatangay testified that he was the mailing custodian of the administrative division of the BIR. He caused the mailing of the assessment notices and other formal demand letters to 21st Century.[12]Singson, on the other hand, stated that he was the revenue officer-seizure agent of the BIR in charge with the collection of the tax liabilities of 21st Century. According to Singson, he prepared the First, Second, and Final Notices for 21st Century to pay its tax liabilities but the latter failed to respond to all the notices. Subsequently, Singson prepared a Warrant of Levy and Distraint as well as a Warrant of Garnishment against 21st Century.[13]After offer of evidence, the prosecution rested its case.On April 7, 2016, petitioner filed a Motion for Leave of Court to File Demurrer to Evidence. However the motion was denied on April 14, 2016, for having been filed out of time. On the same date, petitioner waived presentation of evidence for her defense.[14]Ruling of the Regional Trial CourtOn June 2, 2016, the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Manila, Branch 21, rendered its Decision[15] finding petitioner guilty beyond reasonable doubt of violation of Section 255 in relation to Sections 253(d) and 256 of the NIRC. The RTC likewise ordered petitioner to pay the tax liabilities of 21st Century.[16]The RTC was convinced that the prosecution clearly established the criminal and civil liabilities of petitioner taking into consideration the testimonial and documentary evidence presented by the prosecution.[17]According to the RTC, the prosecution was able to prove that 21st Century failed to pay its overdue tax obligations amounting to P747,964.49 for taxable year 2000 as evidenced by the FANs and FLDs duly served to it. The RTC likewise held that petitioner is 21st Century's responsible officer who may be held criminally liable for violation of the provisions of the NIRC. The RTC emphasized that petitioner judicially admitted being the Executive Vice President of 21st Century at the time of assessment and petitioner even signed and issued a Reply Letter dated August 24, 2006 admitting that 21st Century's tax case has become a delinquent account and requesting for a reasonable time to pay their tax liabilities by way of compromise agreement.[18]Aggrieved, petitioner filed a petition for review to the CTA.Ruling of the Court of Tax Appeals in DivisionOn July 5, 2018, the CTA in Division issued its Decision[19] affirming the conviction of petitioner. However, the CTA in Division deleted the RTC's order for petitioner to pay the tax liabilities. Instead, it was 21st Century that was ordered to be civilly liable for the unpaid taxes.[20]The CTA in Division agreed with the RTC that all the elements of failure to pay taxes were present in this case. According to the CTA in Division, the prosecution's testimonial and documentary evidence amply proved that 21st Century, as the corporate taxpayer, failed to pay its tax liabilities despite demand.[21] The CTA in Division further held that the second element of failure to pay taxes was present in this case since petitioner, as the Executive Vice President of 21st Century at the time of assessment, is the responsible officer thereof. The CTA in Division found that petitioner's letter to the BIR, on behalf of 21st Century, asking for the extension to pay the tax liabilities of 21st Century and expressing her intent to settle the tax liabilities through compromise, proved her position as a responsible officer of 21st Century.[22] Lastly, the CTA in Division concluded that 21st Century's failure to pay its tax liabilities was willful. The CTA in Division emphasized that despite knowing about 21st Century's tax liabilities and despite the numerous chances given to it to pay such liabilities, petitioner, as the responsible officer of 21st Century, still failed to pay the same.[23]Petitioner moved for reconsideration but her motion was denied in a Resolution[24] dated February 20, 2019. Insisting on her innocence, petitioner filed a petition for review to the CTA En Banc.Ruling of the Court of Tax Appeals En BancOn November 19, 2019, the CTA En Banc affirmed the ruling of the CTA in Division.[25]For the CTA En Banc, it was undisputed that 21st Century is required by the NIRC to pay its taxes and that 21st Century failed to pay the same.[26] The CTA En Banc agreed with the conclusion of the CTA in Division that petitioner was a responsible officer of 21st Century who may properly be made liable for failure to pay taxes. The CTA En Banc took note of petitioner's judicial admission that she was the Executive Vice President of 21st Century at the time of the assessment and that she even sent a Letter to the BIR to request extension of payment of the liabilities and expressed her willingness to enter into a compromise with the BIR. These acts, for the CTA En Banc, pointed to no other conclusion than that petitioner was in charge of settling 21st Century's tax liabilities. Therefore, a responsible officer thereof in so far as the provisions of the NIRC on failure to pay taxes are concerned.[27]Petitioner filed a motion for reconsideration. However, the motion was denied in a Resolution dated September 1, 2020.Undaunted, petitioner filed this Petition for Review on Certiorari[28] and Supplemental Petition.[29] Petitioner argues that the CTA should not have ordered 21st Century civilly liable for the tax liabilities as the latter was already dropped from the case as early as the trial before the RTC.[30] Petitioner also claims that the alleged tax deficiencies of 21st Century was not proven because no Preliminary Assessment Notice (PAN) was ever issued to the latter.[31] Lastly, petitioner insists that she is not a responsible officer of 21st Century who may be held criminally liable for failure to pay taxes.[32]In its Comment,[33] the People of the Philippines and the BIR, through the Office of the Solicitor General, reiterate that petitioner's criminal and civil liabilities were duly proven by the prosecution.[34]IssueThe issue in this case is whether petitioner, as the Executive Vice President of 21st Century, may be held criminally liable for 21st Century's failure to pay its tax liabilities.Ruling of the CourtThe petition is meritorious.Before delving into the substantive aspect of this case, the Court shall first deal with procedural matters.The determination of the guilt of an accused hinges on how a court appreciates evidentiary matters in relation to the requisites of an offense. Determination of guilt is, thus, a fundamentally factual issue.[35] The Court is not a trier of facts. Petitioner's Rule 45 petition should therefore only raise questions of law and not of facts. However, in exceptional circumstances, such as when the trial court overlooked material and relevant matters, the Court will recalibrate and evaluate factual findings of the trial courts.[36]In this case, the Court finds the need to reassess the finding of the RTC and CTA on petitioner's guilt.Having discussed the procedural issue, the Court now focuses on the substantive aspect of the case.The provisions of the NIRC relevant to this case are as follows:Section 255. Failure to File Return, Supply Correct and Accurate Information, Pay Tax Withheld and Remit Tax and Refund Excess Taxes Withheld on Compensation. - Any person required under this Code or by rules and regulations promulgated thereunder to pay any tax, make a return, keep any record, or supply correct the accurate information, who willfully fails to pay such tax, make such return, keep such record, or supply correct and accurate information, or withhold or remit taxes withheld, or refund excess taxes withheld on compensation, at the time or times required by law or rules and regulations shall, in addition to other penalties provided by law, upon conviction thereof, be punished by a fine of not less than Ten thousand pesos (P10,000) and suffer imprisonment of not less than one (1) year but not more than ten (10) years.Any person who attempts to make it appear for any reason that he or another has in fact filed a return or statement, or actually files a return or statement and subsequently withdraws the same return or statement after securing the official receiving seal or stamp of receipt of internal revenue office wherein the same was actually filed shall, upon conviction therefore, be punished by a fine of not less than Ten thousand pesos (P10,000) but not more than Twenty thousand pesos (P20,000) and suffer imprisonment of not less than one (1) year but not more than three (3) years.Section 253. General Provisions. \u2013x x x x(d) In the case of associations, partnerships or corporations, the penalty shall be imposed on the partner, president, general manager, branch manager, treasurer, officer-in-charge, and the employees responsible for the violation.x x x xSection 256. Penal Liability of Corporations. \u2013 Any corporation, association or general co-partnership liable for any of the acts or omissions penalized under this Code, in addition to the penalties imposed herein upon the responsible corporate officers, partners, or employees shall, upon conviction for each act or omission, be punished by a fine of not less than Fifty thousand pesos (P50,000) but not more than One hundred thousand pesos (P100,000).As discussed by the CTA En Banc in the assailed decision, the following elements must be established by the prosecution to secure the conviction of petitioner in this case, to wit:(1) That a corporate taxpayer is required under the NIRC to pay any tax, make a return, keep any record, or supply correct and accurate information;(2) That the corporate taxpayer failed to pay the required tax, make a return or keep the required record, or supply the correct and accurate information, or withhold or remit taxes withheld, or refund excess taxes withheld on compensation, at the time or times required by law or rules and regulations; and(3) That accused, as the employee responsible for the violation, willfully failed to pay such tax, make such return, keep such record, or supply such correct and accurate information, or withhold or remit taxes withheld, or refund excess taxes withheld on compensation, at the time or times required by law or rules and regulations.[37]There is no dispute about the presence of the first and second elements. It is the third element \u2013 whether petitioner is a \"responsible officer\" of 21st Century who may be indicted and convicted of failure to pay taxes and who willfully failed to pay such taxes \u2013 that is contentious.As stipulated by both parties during the pre-trial and therefore conclusive as to them, petitioner was the Executive Vice President of 21st Century at the time of the assessment. Section 253 of the NIRC expressly identified the following corporate officers who may be held liable for violations of the NIRC committed by the corporation: partner, president, general manager, branch manager, treasurer, officer-in-charge, and the employees responsible for the violation.Obviously, as an Executive Vice President, petitioner is not one of the corporate officers enumerated under the NIRC. However, the RTC and the CTA were convinced that petitioner falls under the category of employees responsible for the violation because of petitioner's Letter to the BIR asking for an extension of time to pay the tax liabilities of 21st Century, and signifying her intent, as representative of 21st Century, to settle the tax liabilities of the corporation through compromise. The RTC and the CTA concluded that this act is indicative of petitioner's significant role in the management of the affairs of 21st Century, and therefore, liable for the corporation's violation of the NIRC.The Court is not convinced.A corporation is an artificial being created by fiction of law.[38] By the corporation's nature as an abstract being, it cannot be arrested and imprisoned; hence, it cannot be penalized for a crime punishable by imprisonment.[39] As early as 1930 in the case of People v. Tan Boon Kong,[40] the Court already held that for crimes committed by a corporation, the responsible officers thereof would personally bear the criminal liability. This is because a corporation can act only through its officers and agents.In Ching v. Secretary of Justice[41] (Ching), the Court upheld the finding of probable cause and the filing of Informations for violation of Presidential Decree No. 115 or the Trust Receipts Law against petitioner Ching as the one who signed the trust receipts, on behalf of the corporation.In Ching, the Court had the occasion to discuss the liability of corporate officers for acts committed by the corporation as follows:A crime is the doing of that which the penal code forbids to be done, or omitting to do what it commands. A necessary part of the definition of every crime is the designation of the author of the crime upon whom the penalty is to be inflicted. When a criminal statute designates an act of a corporation or a crime and prescribes punishment therefor, it creates a criminal offense which, otherwise, would not exist and such can be committed only by the corporation. But when a penal statute does not expressly apply to corporations, it does not create an offense for which a corporation may be punished. On the other hand, if the State, by statute, defines a crime that may be committed by a corporation but prescribes the penalty therefor to be suffered by the officers, directors, or employees of such corporation or other persons responsible for the offense, only such individuals will suffer such penalty. Corporate officers or employees, through whose act, default or omission the corporation commits a crime, are themselves individually guilty of the crime.The principle applies whether or not the crime requires the consciousness of wrongdoing. It applies to those corporate agents who themselves commit the crime and to those, who, by virtue of their managerial positions or other similar relation to the corporation, could be deemed responsible for its commission, if by virtue of their relationship to the corporation, they had the power to prevent the act. Moreover, all parties active in promoting a crime, whether agents or not, are principals. Whether such officers or employees are benefited by their delictual acts is not a touchstone of their criminal liability. Benefit is not an operative fact.[42]In ABS-CBN v. Gozon (ABS-CBN),[43] the Court discussed that although corporate officers may be held liable for a crime committed under the Intellectual Property Code, their criminal liability stems from their active participation in the commission of the wrongful act. Hence, in ABS-CBN, the Court affirmed the finding of probable cause against two of GMA's executives for copyright infringement of ABS-CBN's news footage because of their position as Head of News Operations and Program Manager. However, the Court excluded from the filing of Information other GMA corporate officers because:Mere membership of the Board or being President per se does not mean knowledge, approval, and participation in the act alleged as criminal. There must be a showing of active participation, not simply a constructive one.[44]This same doctrine was reiterated in SEC v. Price Richardson Corporation[45] where the Court stated that to be criminally liable for the acts of a corporation, there must be a showing that its officers, directors, and shareholders actively participated in or had the power to prevent the wrongful act.In this case, petitioner's position as Executive Vice-President of 21st Century will not per se make her liable for the failure of 21st Century to pay its tax liabilities. In the words of Section 253 of the NIRC, petitioner must have been the employee or officer responsible for the violation.Contrary to the conclusion arrived at by the RTC and CTA, petitioner's Letter to the BIR asking for an extension of time to pay the tax liabilities of 21st Century, and signifying her intent as representative of 21st Century to settle the tax liabilities of the corporation through compromise, is not enough to pronounce her guilt beyond reasonable doubt. This single Letter does not suffice to prove that petitioner has actively participated in, or has failed to prevent the violation by 21st Century of the provisions of the NIRC.As pointed out by petitioner, the prosecution, which has the burden of proving petitioner's guilt beyond reasonable doubt, failed to introduce any evidence that would show that petitioner's duties and responsibilities as Executive Vice-President of 21st Century allowed her to participate in 21st Century's failure to pay its tax liabilities. The records of the case is bereft of any evidence showing that petitioner's acts and omissions caused 21st Century to violate the provisions of the NIRC. The prosecution neither proved that it is within petitioner's power as Executive Vice-President of 21st Century to prevent any such violation. Absent proof that petitioner had any direct and active participation in the non-payment of 21st Century's tax liabilities, the Court cannot convict her of violation of the provisions of the NIRC.On another note, it cannot be said that petitioner's Letter to the BIR, expressing her willingness to settle 21st Century's tax liabilities through compromise, may be received in evidence as an implied admission of her guilt pursuant to Section 28 of Rule 130 of the 2019 Amendment to the Revised Rules on Evidence[46]. The same Rule provides for exceptions, such that, in criminal cases, an offer of compromise for those involving quasi-offenses (criminal negligence) and those allowed by law to be compromised, cannot be received in evidence as an implied admission of the accused's guilt.Section 204 of the NIRC,[47] which provides authority to the CIR to, among others, enter into a compromise with taxpayers, explicitly states that \"[a]ll criminal violations [of the NIRC] may be compromised except: (a) those already filed in court, or (b) those involving fraud.\" Thus, the NIRC itself allows compromise even for violations of its penal provisions.Further, in San Miguel Corporation v. Kalalo[48] involving a criminal case for violation of Batas Pambansa Blg. 22, the Court held that the accused's act of sending the Offer of Compromise prior to the filing of the criminal complaint was not made in the context of a criminal proceeding, and therefore, cannot be considered as an implied admission of guilt. Here, petitioner's alleged letter to the RDO expressing her willingness to settle the tax liabilities of 21st Century was sent on August 24, 2006. It was only on May 28, 2007 that the RDO issued a Memorandum recommending the filing of proper case against 21st Century for failure to pay its delinquent tax liabilities, while the Information was only filed on August 21, 2008 by the Office of the City Prosecutor of Manila. Thus, petitioner's offer of compromise cannot be received in evidence as an implied admission of guilt.In criminal cases, the overriding consideration is not whether the court doubts the innocence of the accused but whether it entertains a reasonable doubt as to his guilt. If there exists even one iota of doubt, this Court is under a longstanding legal injunction to resolve the doubt in favor of the accused.[49]WHEREFORE, the Petition for Review on Certiorari is GRANTED.

PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES AND THE BUREAU OF INTERNAL REVENUE, RESPONDENTS.\n\nD E C I S I O N\n\nCARANDANG, J.:\n\nBefore this Court is a Petition for Review on Certiorari [1] under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court assailing the Decision [2] dated November 19, 2019 and Resolution dated September 1, 2020 rendered by the Court of Tax Appeals (CTA) En Banc in CTA EB Crim. Case No. 066, which affirmed the conviction of Genoveva S. Suarez (petitioner), as Executive Vice-President of 21 st Century Entertainment, Inc. (21 st Century), for violation of Section 255 in relation to Sections 253(d) and 256 of the National Internal Revenue Code (NIRC) or the failure of 21 st Century to pay its tax liabilities.\n\nFacts of the Case\nOn August 21, 2008, the Office of the City Prosecutor of Manila filed an Information against petitioner for violation of Section 255, in relation to Sections 253(d) and 256 of the NIRC, committed as follows:\nThat on or about January 23, 2004, and continuously up to present, in the City of Manila, Philippines, the said accused being then the President of 21 st CENTURY ENTERTAINMENT, INC. with business address at Room 207 Tiaoqui Bldg., Sta. Cruz, Manila, and therefore the responsible officer of the said Corporation, to whom notices and demands were made by the Bureau of Internal Revenue, represented in this case by ATTY. HABARI LUCMAN BALT, to pay the Corporation's overdue tax obligations amounting to PhP747,964.49 under BIR Assessment Notice No. 31-2000, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and knowingly fail, refuse and neglect to pay the Bureau of Internal Revenue the said amount of PhP747,964.49 despite due notice and demand without formally protesting and appealing the same with the proper authority, to the damage and prejudice of the Government of the Republic of the Philippines sin (sic) the same sum of PhP747,964.49, Philippine currency.\n\nCONTRARY TO LAW. [3] On February 4, 2009, petitioner pleaded not guilty to the offense charged. During pre-trial, the prosecution and defense stipulated that petitioner is the Executive Vice-President of 21 st Century at the time of the assessment. [4]\n\nAs culled from the records of this case, the facts are as follows:\n\nOn January 23, 2004, the Commissioner of Internal Revenue (CIR) issued Final Assessment Notices (FANs) and Final Letters of Demand (FLDs) to 21 st Century, demanding payment for deficiency income tax, improperly accumulated earnings tax, minimum corporate income tax, expanded withholding tax, value-added tax, and compromise penalty, in the aggregate amount of P747,964.49 for taxable year 2000. [5]\n\nOn February 26, 2004, 21 st Century, represented by its Vice-President, John S. Suarez, filed a Protest against the FLDs and requested the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) for reinvestigation of the assessment issued against it. However, on December 5, 2005, the case docket of 21 st Century was forwarded to the Chief Collection Division, for collection of the deficiency taxes because of 21 st Century's failure to submit within 60 days from date of protest supporting documents to refute the assessment. [6]\n\nOn December 19, 2005, the Revenue District Officer (RDO) issued the First Notice of Delinquent Account to 21 st Century requiring it to settle its tax deficiencies. The RDO warned 21 st Century that in case of failure to settle its tax obligations, the case shall be referred to the BIR legal division for appropriate action. On January 3, 2006, the RDO issued a Second Notice of Delinquent Account against 21 st Century, informing the latter that the case has been referred to the BIR Legal Division. The RDO likewise reiterated that 21 st Century should pay its tax deficiencies to avoid the issuance of a Warrant of Distraint and/or Levy (WDL) or Garnishment. Despite the foregoing notices, 21 st Century still failed to settle its obligations; hence, on March 17, 2006, the BIR issued a Final Notice before Seizure addressed to Richard Suarez. [7]\n\nOn August 24, 2006, in a bid to prevent the seizure of 2 st Century's properties, petitioner sent a Letter to the RDO requesting additional time to secure the services of an external accountant to assist 21 st Century in organizing its accounting records so that it could provide the BIR evidence supporting its financial statements and income tax returns Petitioner also expressed her willingness to settle 21 st Century's tax liabilities, through compromise. [8] Despite this, the CIR, on November 28, 2006, issued a WDL against 21 st Century. [9]\n\nOn March 7, 2007, the BIR issued a Warrant of Garnishment to Equitable-PCI Bank against the account of 21 st Century, to no avail. Hence, on May 28, 2007, the RDO issued a Memorandum recommending the filing of proper case against 21 st Century for failure to pay its delinquent tax liabilities. [10]\n\nDuring the trial, the prosecution presented Ma. Paz Arcilla (Arcilla), Armando Macatangay (Macatangay) and Dionisio Singson (Singson) as its witnesses.\n\nArcilla, a revenue officer of the BIR, testified that she supervises the preparation, issuance, and monitoring of demand letters, final assessments, and transcripts of assessments of tax cases. According to her, the original copies of the assessment notices and formal letters of demand were sent to the registered address of 21 st Century and the same were duly received by 21 st Century as evidenced by their filing of a protest letter to the FAN. [11]\n\nMacatangay testified that he was the mailing custodian of the administrative division of the BIR. He caused the mailing of the assessment notices and other formal demand letters to 21 st Century. [12]\n\nSingson, on the other hand, stated that he was the revenue officer-seizure agent of the BIR in charge with the collection of the tax liabilities of 21 st Century. According to Singson, he prepared the First, Second, and Final Notices for 21 st Century to pay its tax liabilities but the latter failed to respond to all the notices. Subsequently, Singson prepared a Warrant of Levy and Distraint as well as a Warrant of Garnishment against 21 st Century. [13]\n\nAfter offer of evidence, the prosecution rested its case.\n\nOn April 7, 2016, petitioner filed a Motion for Leave of Court to File Demurrer to Evidence. However the motion was denied on April 14, 2016, for having been filed out of time. On the same date, petitioner waived presentation of evidence for her defense. [14]\n\nRuling of the Regional Trial Court\nOn June 2, 2016, the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Manila, Branch 21, rendered its Decision [15] finding petitioner guilty beyond reasonable doubt of violation of Section 255 in relation to Sections 253(d) and 256 of the NIRC. The RTC likewise ordered petitioner to pay the tax liabilities of 21 st Century. [16]\n\nThe RTC was convinced that the prosecution clearly established the criminal and civil liabilities of petitioner taking into consideration the testimonial and documentary evidence presented by the prosecution. [17]\n\nAccording to the RTC, the prosecution was able to prove that 21 st Century failed to pay its overdue tax obligations amounting to P747,964.49 for taxable year 2000 as evidenced by the FANs and FLDs duly served to it. The RTC likewise held that petitioner is 21 st Century's responsible officer who may be held criminally liable for violation of the provisions of the NIRC. The RTC emphasized that petitioner judicially admitted being the Executive Vice President of 21 st Century at the time of assessment and petitioner even signed and issued a Reply Letter dated August 24, 2006 admitting that 21 st Century's tax case has become a delinquent account and requesting for a reasonable time to pay their tax liabilities by way of compromise agreement. [18]\n\nAggrieved, petitioner filed a petition for review to the CTA.\n\nRuling of the Court of Tax Appeals in Division\nOn July 5, 2018, the CTA in Division issued its Decision [19] affirming the conviction of petitioner. However, the CTA in Division deleted the RTC's order for petitioner to pay the tax liabilities. Instead, it was 21 st Century that was ordered to be civilly liable for the unpaid taxes. [20]\n\nThe CTA in Division agreed with the RTC that all the elements of failure to pay taxes were present in this case. According to the CTA in Division, the prosecution's testimonial and documentary evidence amply proved that 21 st Century, as the corporate taxpayer, failed to pay its tax liabilities despite demand. [21] The CTA in Division further held that the second element of failure to pay taxes was present in this case since petitioner, as the Executive Vice President of 21 st Century at the time of assessment, is the responsible officer thereof. The CTA in Division found that petitioner's letter to the BIR, on behalf of 21 st Century, asking for the extension to pay the tax liabilities of 21 st Century and expressing her intent to settle the tax liabilities through compromise, proved her position as a responsible officer of 21 st Century. [22] Lastly, the CTA in Division concluded that 21 st Century's failure to pay its tax liabilities was willful. The CTA in Division emphasized that despite knowing about 21 st Century's tax liabilities and despite the numerous chances given to it to pay such liabilities, petitioner, as the responsible officer of 21 st Century, still failed to pay the same. [23]\n\nPetitioner moved for reconsideration but her motion was denied in a Resolution [24] dated February 20, 2019. Insisting on her innocence, petitioner filed a petition for review to the CTA En Banc.\n\nRuling of the Court of Tax Appeals En Banc\nOn November 19, 2019, the CTA En Banc affirmed the ruling of the CTA in Division. [25]\n\nFor the CTA En Banc, it was undisputed that 21 st Century is required by the NIRC to pay its taxes and that 21 st Century failed to pay the same. [26] The CTA En Banc agreed with the conclusion of the CTA in Division that petitioner was a responsible officer of 21 st Century who may properly be made liable for failure to pay taxes. The CTA En Banc took note of petitioner's judicial admission that she was the Executive Vice President of 21 st Century at the time of the assessment and that she even sent a Letter to the BIR to request extension of payment of the liabilities and expressed her willingness to enter into a compromise with the BIR. These acts, for the CTA En Banc, pointed to no other conclusion than that petitioner was in charge of settling 21 st Century's tax liabilities. Therefore, a responsible officer thereof in so far as the provisions of the NIRC on failure to pay taxes are concerned. [27]\n\nPetitioner filed a motion for reconsideration. However, the motion was denied in a Resolution dated September 1, 2020.\n\nUndaunted, petitioner filed this Petition for Review on Certiorari [28] and Supplemental Petition. [29] Petitioner argues that the CTA should not have ordered 21 st Century civilly liable for the tax liabilities as the latter was already dropped from the case as early as the trial before the RTC. [30] Petitioner also claims that the alleged tax deficiencies of 21 st Century was not proven because no Preliminary Assessment Notice (PAN) was ever issued to the latter. [31] Lastly, petitioner insists that she is not a responsible officer of 21 st Century who may be held criminally liable for failure to pay taxes. [32]\n\nIn its Comment, [33] the People of the Philippines and the BIR, through the Office of the Solicitor General, reiterate that petitioner's criminal and civil liabilities were duly proven by the prosecution. [34]\n\nIssue\nThe issue in this case is whether petitioner, as the Executive Vice President of 21 st Century, may be held criminally liable for 21 st Century's failure to pay its tax liabilities.\n\nRuling of the Court\nThe petition is meritorious.\n\nBefore delving into the substantive aspect of this case, the Court shall first deal with procedural matters.\n\nThe determination of the guilt of an accused hinges on how a court appreciates evidentiary matters in relation to the requisites of an offense. Determination of guilt is, thus, a fundamentally factual issue. [35] The Court is not a trier of facts. Petitioner's Rule 45 petition should therefore only raise questions of law and not of facts. However, in exceptional circumstances, such as when the trial court overlooked material and relevant matters, the Court will recalibrate and evaluate factual findings of the trial courts. [36]\n\nIn this case, the Court finds the need to reassess the finding of the RTC and CTA on petitioner's guilt.\n\nHaving discussed the procedural issue, the Court now focuses on the substantive aspect of the case.\n\nThe provisions of the NIRC relevant to this case are as follows:\nSection 255. Failure to File Return, Supply Correct and Accurate Information, Pay Tax Withheld and Remit Tax and Refund Excess Taxes Withheld on Compensation. - Any person required under this Code or by rules and regulations promulgated thereunder to pay any tax, make a return, keep any record, or supply correct the accurate information, who willfully fails to pay such tax, make such return, keep such record, or supply correct and accurate information, or withhold or remit taxes withheld, or refund excess taxes withheld on compensation, at the time or times required by law or rules and regulations shall, in addition to other penalties provided by law, upon conviction thereof, be punished by a fine of not less than Ten thousand pesos (P10,000) and suffer imprisonment of not less than one (1) year but not more than ten (10) years.\n\nAny person who attempts to make it appear for any reason that he or another has in fact filed a return or statement, or actually files a return or statement and subsequently withdraws the same return or statement after securing the official receiving seal or stamp of receipt of internal revenue office wherein the same was actually filed shall, upon conviction therefore, be punished by a fine of not less than Ten thousand pesos (P10,000) but not more than Twenty thousand pesos (P20,000) and suffer imprisonment of not less than one (1) year but not more than three (3) years.\n\nSection 253. General Provisions. \u2013\n\nx x x x\n\n(d) In the case of associations, partnerships or corporations, the penalty shall be imposed on the partner, president, general manager, branch manager, treasurer, officer-in-charge, and the employees responsible for the violation.\n\nx x x x\n\nSection 256. Penal Liability of Corporations. \u2013 Any corporation, association or general co-partnership liable for any of the acts or omissions penalized under this Code, in addition to the penalties imposed herein upon the responsible corporate officers, partners, or employees shall, upon conviction for each act or omission, be punished by a fine of not less than Fifty thousand pesos (P50,000) but not more than One hundred thousand pesos (P100,000).\nAs discussed by the CTA En Banc in the assailed decision, the following elements must be established by the prosecution to secure the conviction of petitioner in this case, to wit:\n\n[TABLE_CONTENT]\n(1) | That a corporate taxpayer is required under the NIRC to pay any tax, make a return, keep any record, or supply correct and accurate information;\n(2) | That the corporate taxpayer failed to pay the required tax, make a return or keep the required record, or supply the correct and accurate information, or withhold or remit taxes withheld, or refund excess taxes withheld on compensation, at the time or times required by law or rules and regulations; and\n(3) | That accused, as the employee responsible for the violation, willfully failed to pay such tax, make such return, keep such record, or supply such correct and accurate information, or withhold or remit taxes withheld, or refund excess taxes withheld on compensation, at the time or times required by law or rules and regulations.[37]\n[END_TABLE]\n\n(1) That a corporate taxpayer is required under the NIRC to pay any tax, make a return, keep any record, or supply correct and accurate information; (2) That the corporate taxpayer failed to pay the required tax, make a return or keep the required record, or supply the correct and accurate information, or withhold or remit taxes withheld, or refund excess taxes withheld on compensation, at the time or times required by law or rules and regulations; and (3) That accused, as the employee responsible for the violation, willfully failed to pay such tax, make such return, keep such record, or supply such correct and accurate information, or withhold or remit taxes withheld, or refund excess taxes withheld on compensation, at the time or times required by law or rules and regulations. [37] There is no dispute about the presence of the first and second elements. It is the third element \u2013 whether petitioner is a \"responsible officer\" of 21 st Century who may be indicted and convicted of failure to pay taxes and who willfully failed to pay such taxes \u2013 that is contentious.\n\nAs stipulated by both parties during the pre-trial and therefore conclusive as to them, petitioner was the Executive Vice President of 21 st Century at the time of the assessment. Section 253 of the NIRC expressly identified the following corporate officers who may be held liable for violations of the NIRC committed by the corporation: partner, president, general manager, branch manager, treasurer, officer-in-charge, and the employees responsible for the violation.\n\nObviously, as an Executive Vice President, petitioner is not one of the corporate officers enumerated under the NIRC. However, the RTC and the CTA were convinced that petitioner falls under the category of employees responsible for the violation because of petitioner's Letter to the BIR asking for an extension of time to pay the tax liabilities of 21 st Century, and signifying her intent, as representative of 21 st Century, to settle the tax liabilities of the corporation through compromise. The RTC and the CTA concluded that this act is indicative of petitioner's significant role in the management of the affairs of 21 st Century, and therefore, liable for the corporation's violation of the NIRC.\n\nThe Court is not convinced.\n\nA corporation is an artificial being created by fiction of law. [38] By the corporation's nature as an abstract being, it cannot be arrested and imprisoned; hence, it cannot be penalized for a crime punishable by imprisonment. [39] As early as 1930 in the case of People v. Tan Boon Kong, [40] the Court already held that for crimes committed by a corporation, the responsible officers thereof would personally bear the criminal liability. This is because a corporation can act only through its officers and agents.\n\nIn Ching v. Secretary of Justice [41] ( Ching ), the Court upheld the finding of probable cause and the filing of Informations for violation of Presidential Decree No. 115 or the Trust Receipts Law against petitioner Ching as the one who signed the trust receipts, on behalf of the corporation.\n\nIn Ching, the Court had the occasion to discuss the liability of corporate officers for acts committed by the corporation as follows:\nA crime is the doing of that which the penal code forbids to be done, or omitting to do what it commands. A necessary part of the definition of every crime is the designation of the author of the crime upon whom the penalty is to be inflicted. When a criminal statute designates an act of a corporation or a crime and prescribes punishment therefor, it creates a criminal offense which, otherwise, would not exist and such can be committed only by the corporation. But when a penal statute does not expressly apply to corporations, it does not create an offense for which a corporation may be punished. On the other hand, if the State, by statute, defines a crime that may be committed by a corporation but prescribes the penalty therefor to be suffered by the officers, directors, or employees of such corporation or other persons responsible for the offense, only such individuals will suffer such penalty. Corporate officers or employees, through whose act, default or omission the corporation commits a crime, are themselves individually guilty of the crime.\n\nThe principle applies whether or not the crime requires the consciousness of wrongdoing. It applies to those corporate agents who themselves commit the crime and to those, who, by virtue of their managerial positions or other similar relation to the corporation, could be deemed responsible for its commission, if by virtue of their relationship to the corporation, they had the power to prevent the act. Moreover, all parties active in promoting a crime, whether agents or not, are principals. Whether such officers or employees are benefited by their delictual acts is not a touchstone of their criminal liability. Benefit is not an operative fact. [42] In ABS-CBN v. Gozon (ABS-CBN), [43] the Court discussed that although corporate officers may be held liable for a crime committed under the Intellectual Property Code, their criminal liability stems from their active participation in the commission of the wrongful act. Hence, in ABS-CBN, the Court affirmed the finding of probable cause against two of GMA's executives for copyright infringement of ABS-CBN's news footage because of their position as Head of News Operations and Program Manager. However, the Court excluded from the filing of Information other GMA corporate officers because:\nMere membership of the Board or being President per se does not mean knowledge, approval, and participation in the act alleged as criminal. There must be a showing of active participation, not simply a constructive one. [44] This same doctrine was reiterated in SEC v. Price Richardson Corporation [45] where the Court stated that to be criminally liable for the acts of a corporation, there must be a showing that its officers, directors, and shareholders actively participated in or had the power to prevent the wrongful act.\n\nIn this case, petitioner's position as Executive Vice-President of 21 st Century will not per se make her liable for the failure of 21 st Century to pay its tax liabilities. In the words of Section 253 of the NIRC, petitioner must have been the employee or officer responsible for the violation.\n\nContrary to the conclusion arrived at by the RTC and CTA, petitioner's Letter to the BIR asking for an extension of time to pay the tax liabilities of 21 st Century, and signifying her intent as representative of 21 st Century to settle the tax liabilities of the corporation through compromise, is not enough to pronounce her guilt beyond reasonable doubt. This single Letter does not suffice to prove that petitioner has actively participated in, or has failed to prevent the violation by 21 st Century of the provisions of the NIRC.\n\nAs pointed out by petitioner, the prosecution, which has the burden of proving petitioner's guilt beyond reasonable doubt, failed to introduce any evidence that would show that petitioner's duties and responsibilities as Executive Vice-President of 21 st Century allowed her to participate in 21 st Century's failure to pay its tax liabilities. The records of the case is bereft of any evidence showing that petitioner's acts and omissions caused 21 st Century to violate the provisions of the NIRC. The prosecution neither proved that it is within petitioner's power as Executive Vice-President of 21 st Century to prevent any such violation. Absent proof that petitioner had any direct and active participation in the non-payment of 21 st Century's tax liabilities, the Court cannot convict her of violation of the provisions of the NIRC.\n\nOn another note, it cannot be said that petitioner's Letter to the BIR, expressing her willingness to settle 21 st Century's tax liabilities through compromise, may be received in evidence as an implied admission of her guilt pursuant to Section 28 of Rule 130 of the 2019 Amendment to the Revised Rules on Evidence [46] . The same Rule provides for exceptions, such that, in criminal cases, an offer of compromise for those involving quasi-offenses (criminal negligence) and those allowed by law to be compromised, cannot be received in evidence as an implied admission of the accused's guilt.\n\nSection 204 of the NIRC, [47] which provides authority to the CIR to, among others, enter into a compromise with taxpayers, explicitly states that \"[a]ll criminal violations [of the NIRC] may be compromised except: (a) those already filed in court, or (b) those involving fraud.\" Thus, the NIRC itself allows compromise even for violations of its penal provisions.\n\nFurther, in San Miguel Corporation v. Kalalo [48] involving a criminal case for violation of Batas Pambansa Blg. 22, the Court held that the accused's act of sending the Offer of Compromise prior to the filing of the criminal complaint was not made in the context of a criminal proceeding, and therefore, cannot be considered as an implied admission of guilt. Here, petitioner's alleged letter to the RDO expressing her willingness to settle the tax liabilities of 21 st Century was sent on August 24, 2006. It was only on May 28, 2007 that the RDO issued a Memorandum recommending the filing of proper case against 21 st Century for failure to pay its delinquent tax liabilities, while the Information was only filed on August 21, 2008 by the Office of the City Prosecutor of Manila. Thus, petitioner's offer of compromise cannot be received in evidence as an implied admission of guilt.\n\nIn criminal cases, the overriding consideration is not whether the court doubts the innocence of the accused but whether it entertains a reasonable doubt as to his guilt. If there exists even one iota of doubt, this Court is under a longstanding legal injunction to resolve the doubt in favor of the accused. [49]\n\nWHEREFORE, the Petition for Review on Certiorari is GRANTED.

LILAGAN, REGIONAL TRIAL COURT, BRANCH 34, TACLOBAN CITY, LUDY C. MARMITA, SHERIFF IV, REGIONAL TRIAL COURT, BRANCH 9, TACLOBAN CITY, ESTEBAN B. SACRAMENTO AND THE HEIRS OF SALVACION SIONY L. SACRAMENTO, RESPONDENTS.R E S O L U T I O N LOPEZ, M., J.: The doctrine of res judicata requires that stability be accorded to judgments lest there would be endless controversies. The relitigation of issues already settled burdens the courts and the taxpayers, creates uneasiness and confusion, and wastes valuable time and energy that could be devoted to worthier causes.[1] We apply this policy in this Petition for Review on Certiorari[2] under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court assailing the Court of Appeals-Cebu City's (CA) Decision[3] dated April 30, 2015 in CA-G.R. S.P. No. 07675.ANTECEDENTSSpouses Esteban R. Sacramento and Salvacion Siony L. Sacramento (Spouses Sacramento) owned parcels of land situated in Barangay Sto. Ni\u00f1o, Tacloban City which includes Lot No. 4144. The City Government of Tacloban, with authority from the Sangguniang Panlungsod, filed before the Regional Trial Court (RTC) a complaint for eminent domain over a portion of Lot No. 4144 for use as access road to the city's dumpsite.[4] On September 8, 2008, the parties entered into a Compromise Agreement[5] with the following terms and conditions, to wit:NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing premises, the parties hereby undertake as follows:(1) The FIRST PARTY shall pay unto the SECOND PARTIES the amount of TWO HUNDRED EIGHTY PESOS ([P]280.00), Philippine Currency, per square meter, as compensation for the acquisition of Lot No. 4144, with an area of about 49,057 sq. meters or a total amount of THIRTEEN MILLION SEVEN HUNDRED THIRTY-FIVE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED SIXTY PESOS ([P]13,735,960.00), Philippine Currency, the lot being the subject of the above-captioned, under the following payment schedule:1.1) One-half (1/2) or the amount of SIX MILLION EIGHT HUNDRED SIXTY-SEVEN THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED EIGHTY PESOS ([P]6,867,980.00) to be paid after ratification of this Compromise Agreement by the Sangguniang Panlungsod of Tacloban;1.2) The other half of SIX MILLION EIGHT HUNDRED SIXTY-SEVEN THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED EIGHTY PESOS ([P]6,867,980.00) shall be paid in two (2) equal installments in the amount of THREE MILLION FOUR HUNDRED THIRTY-THREE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED NINETY PESOS ([P]3,433,990.00) in the succeeding two (2) quarters;(2) The SECOND PARTY shall pay all realty taxes, documentary stamp tax, capital gains tax, sales tax, transfer tax, registration fees, estate tax and other liabilities in connection with the land subject of the above-captioned case and the sale, transfer or conveyance of the same as well as all their obligations and obligations to other parties including those in favor of their lawyer;(3) The parties agree to, and shall cause, the dismissal, with prejudice, of the above-captioned case, including all claims and counterclaims therein, and agree not to file any similar case, whether civil, administrative or criminal, of any kind or nature whatsoever, arising from the same facts, incident, claim, cause or causes of action;(4) The parties hereby mutually, irrevocably, freely, and voluntarily release and forever discharge one another, from any and all manner of action, causes of action, sum of money, damages, liability, responsibility, obligation, claims and demands whatsoever in law or equity, which they had, now have, or may have against each other, including, but not limited to, actual, moral, exemplary and all other damages or causes of action provided for under the law if any, arising, directly or indirectly, from the facts and circumstances giving rise to, surrounding or arising from the complaint and/or counterclaims in the Pending Case, all of which claims or causes of action by these presents the parties hereby abandon and waive;(5) This agreement shall not in any way be construed as an admission on the part of any party of any fault, negligence, or liability, of whatever kind and nature, in connection with the Pending Case;(6) That the parties hereto agree to declare the FIRST PARTY as the true, legal, and absolute owner of the property subject matter hereof;(7) In case of material breach of the terms and conditions of this agreement, the innocent party is hereby authorized to apply for a writ of execution in the Pending Case for the purpose of compelling compliance with the terms and conditions of this agreement.[6] (Emphases in the original.) On September 18, 2008, the RTC, presided by Judge Rogelio C. Sescon (Judge Sescon) approved the Compromise Agreement and directed the parties to comply with its terms and conditions.[7] On September 24, 2008, the Sangguniang Panlungsod ratified the agreement through Resolution No. 2008-10-530 stating: \"RESOLVE, as it is hereby resolved, to confirm/ratify the Compromise Agreement entered into by the Parties in Civil Case No. 2006-01-04 and duly approved by Hon. Rogelio C. Sescon, Presiding Judge, RTC Branch 9, Tacloban City dated September 18, 2008[.]\"[8] On November 19, 2008, however, the Sangguniang Panlungsod withdrew its ratification and issued Resolution No. 2008-10-581 entitled \"RESOLUTION WITHDRAWING/RESCINDING AND/OR REPEALING AND DECLARING AS NULL AND VOID RESOLUTION NO. 2008-10-530 PASSED AND APPROVED BY THIS HONORABLE BODY ON SEPTEMBER 24, 2008.\"[9]Meantime, Spouses Sacramento moved for the enforcement of the compromise agreement. On March 16, 2009, the RTC denied[10] the motion for execution in view of the withdrawal of the city council's ratification of the compromise agreement, viz.:This Court after going over the allegations of the parties, allegations, and counter-allegations in their subject motion and comments and/or oppositions and finding that the Sangguniang Panlungsod of Tacloban City had passed and approved Resolution No. 2008-10-[581] withdrawing/rescinding and declaring as null and void Resolution No. 2008-10-530 so that there is no more compromise agreement to speak of, finds the defendants' motion for execution of judgment to be devoid of merit, and therefore, this Court denies the same.SO ORDERED.[11] Spouses Sacramento filed a motion for reconsideration. On June 4, 2009, the RTC granted the motion,[12] and ordered the enforcement of the compromise agreement. On July 1, 2009, a Writ of Execution[13] was issued. Unsuccessful at a reconsideration,[14] the City Government of Tacloban elevated the case to the CA through a Petition for Certiorari[15] docketed as CA-G.R. SP No. 04526. The City Government of Tacloban argued that public funds are not subject to levy and execution, and that the judgment based on a compromise agreement cannot be enforced without a valid ratification from the city council.[16]On June 22, 2011, the CA dismissed the petition for certiorari absent grave abuse of discretion on the part of the RTC,[17] thus:The parties' decision to enter into judicial compromise agreements to put an end to litigation is recognized in this jurisdiction. The court cannot impose a judgment different from the terms of a compromise agreement when such concurrence is not contrary to law, judicial decision, morals, good customs, or public policy. Once judicially approved, a compromise agreement becomes more than a binding contract to the parties and has the effect of res judicata. Just like any final judgment, \"the winning party is entitled to a writ of execution and the issuance thereof becomes a court's ministerial duty.\" The Supreme Court has categorically ruled that a judgment upon a compromise is immediately executory, where neither party moved to have it set aside on the ground of vices of consent or forgery.Before this Court, petitioner invoked Sangguniang Panglungsod's Resolution No. 2008-10-581 dated 19 November 2008, which rescinded its prior ratification of the subject Compromise Agreement because \"following the passage of [Resolution No. 2008-10-530], Hon. Ranulfo S. Abellanosa discovered that the subject land, Lot 4144, to be acquired from Spouses Esteban and Salvacion Sacramento exceeded greatly in area and price from what was authorized to the city mayor to acquire x x x\" and further cited grounds which make the enforcement of the issued writ of execution invalid due to lack of enabling laws.Unfortunately for petitioner, it can no longer impugn the validity of the Writ of Execution of 18 September 2008 which was issued out of public respondent's [fulfillment] of a ministerial duty. A final judgment is a vested right, which is protected by law. Certainly, \"a party upon whose initiative an agreement was made, on the basis of which the court rendered judgment, is estopped to question the propriety of the action of the court, in the absence of showing that his consent to the agreement was secured through fraud, which at any rate could not possibly exist, the agreement being of his own making.\"[18] (Emphases supplied and citations omitted.) The CA's decision in CA-G.R. SP No. 04526 lapsed into finality. On February 23, 2012, the CA issued an entry of judgment. Later, Spouses Sacramento moved before the RTC to direct the City Government of Tacloban to comply with the compromise agreement. On June 23, 2011, the RTC granted the motion and issued the corresponding alias writ of execution, and notices of attachment and levy.[19] Undaunted, the City Government of Tacloban moved to quash the writ of execution and to lift the notices of attachment and levy. On October 24, 2011, the RTC granted the motion.[20]Dissatisfied, Spouses Sacramento sought reconsideration but was denied. Thereafter, Judge Sescon inhibited and the case was transferred to Judge Frisco T. Lilagan (Judge Lilagan). Spouses Sacramento, again, moved for the issuance an alias writ of execution. On November 28, 2012, the RTC ruled that an alias writ is no longer necessary and ordered to continue the enforcement of the writ of execution issued on July 1, 2009,[21] to wit:First: This Court just like the original Court, being merely Regional Trial Courts, cannot modify, defy, violate, or much less reverse the Decision of the Honorable Court of Appeals affirming the validity and legality of the Writ of Execution which the original Court issued. It must be stressed that this Decision of the Court of Appeals had already attained its finality without the said Decision having been appealed.x x x xIt must be remembered that the Decision in this case is by reason of a Compromise Agreement, and a Compromise Agreement once approved by the Court becomes immediately final and executory. The Order approving the Compromise Agreement was issued on September 18, 2008. Legally and technically, therefore, the Writ of Execution issued to enforce the Compromise Agreement is still valid and subsisting. It is in this regard that this Court finds it unnecessary to issue an Alias Writ of Execution, instead to order the herein executing Sheriff, Sheriff IV LUDY C. MARMITA to execute and enforce the said Writ of Execution dated July 1, 2009 already issued and to make a return thereof in accordance with the provisions of the Rules of Court.[22] (Emphasis supplied.) Unsuccessful at a reconsideration, the City Government of Tacloban, again, elevated the case to the CA through a petition for review on certiorari docketed as CA-G.R. SP No. 07675.[23] The City Government of Tacloban posited that Judge Lilagan erred in implementing the writ of execution which a co-equal court had quashed and lifted.[24] On April 30, 2015, the CA dismissed the petition on the ground of res judicata by conclusiveness of judgment, viz:The elements of res judicata under the concept of conclusiveness of judgment are:Identity of parties; andSubject matter in the first and second cases.The presence of the first element is not disputed considering that the parties in G.R. SP No. 04526 and in this case are similar. Also attendant is the last element, identity of the subject matter or the issue. A perusal of the allegations in the present case evidently shows that the petitioner mentioned issues similarly raised and already resolved in G.R. SP No. 04526. It must be emphasized that the order assailed in the present case is just enforcing the Writ of Execution issued on July 1, 2009 which was already passed upon in G.R. SP No. 04526.[25] Hence, this petition.[26] The City Government of Tacloban insists that the issues in CA-G.R. SP No. 04526 and CA-G.R. SP No. 07675 are different. In CA-G.R. SP No. 04526, the question is whether Judge Sescon committed grave abuse of discretion in enforcing the compromise agreement. On the other hand, the issue in CA-G.R. SP No. 07675 is whether Judge Lilagan was correct in implementing the previously quashed writ of execution dated July 1, 2009.[27]RULINGThe petition is unmeritorious.It bears emphasis that a compromise agreement is in the nature of both a contract and a judgment on the merits.[28] As a contract, the compromise agreement can only be avoided on grounds of illegality, lack of consent, fraud or duress.[29] In this case, Spouses Sacramento and the City Government of Tacloban freely and voluntarily entered into a compromise agreement. The terms and conditions of the agreement are likewise clear. Moreover, the RTC approved the agreement and the Sangguniang Panlungsod ratified it. The parties knew exactly the rights and duties they assumed. The City Government of Tacloban did not even file any action or motion to set aside the agreement. It is settled that a compromise agreement, once stamped with judicial imprimatur, becomes more than a mere contract and acquires the force and effect of a judgment that is immediately final and executory.[30] As such, the City Government of Tacloban cannot, later, relieve itself of liability simply because the city council changed its position. To be sure, the RTC issued a writ of execution on July 1, 2009, to enforce the agreement as a matter of course. The validity of the writ of execution was settled with finality in CA-G.R. SP No. 04526.Corollarily, the CA correctly applied the principle of res judicata in dismissing the petition for certiorari in CA-G.R. SP No. 07675. The elements of res judicata are: (1) the judgment sought to bar the new action must be final; (2) the decision must have been rendered by a court having jurisdiction over the subject matter and the parties; (3) the disposition of the case must be a judgment on the merits; and (4) there must be as between the first and second action, identity of parties, subject matter, and causes of action.[31] Apropos is Section (Sec.) 47, Rule 39 of the Rules of Court, to wit:SEC. 47. Effect of judgments or final orders. \u2013 The effect of a judgment or final order rendered by a court of the Philippines, having jurisdiction to pronounce the judgment or final order, may be as follows:x x x x(b) In other cases, the judgment or final order is, with respect to the matter directly adjudged or as to any other matter that could have been raised in relation thereto, conclusive between the parties and their successors in interest by title subsequent to the commencement of the action or special proceeding, litigating for the same thing and under the same title and in the same capacity; and(c) In any other litigation between the same parties or their successors in interest, that only is deemed to have been adjudged in a former judgment or final order which appears upon its face to have been so adjudged, or which was actually and necessarily included therein or necessary thereto. Based on the above-quoted provision, res judicata is applicable either under the concept of \"bar by prior judgment\" under Sec. 47 (b), Rule 39; or \"conclusiveness of judgment\" under Sec. 47 (c), Rule 39. Case law explained that if there is identity of parties, subject matter, and causes of action in the two cases, then res judicata in its aspect as a \"bar by prior judgment\" would apply. If, as between the two cases, only identity of parties can be shown, but not identical causes of action, then res judicata as \"conclusiveness of judgment\" applies,[32] thus:There is \"bar by prior judgment\" when, as between the first case where the judgment was rendered and the second case that is sought to be barred, there is identity of parties, subject matter, and causes of action. In this instance, the judgment in the first case constitutes an absolute bar to the second action. Otherwise put, the judgment or decree of the court of competent jurisdiction on the merits concludes the litigation between the parties, as well as their privies, and constitutes a bar to a new action or suit involving the same cause of action before the same or any other tribunal.But where there is identity of parties in the first and second cases, but no identity of causes of action, the first judgment is conclusive only as to those matters actually and directly controverted and determined and not as to matters merely involved therein. This is the concept of res judicata known as \"conclusiveness of judgment.\" Stated differently, any right, fact or matter in issue directly adjudicated or necessarily involved in the determination of an action before a competent court in which judgment is rendered on the merits is conclusively settled by the judgment therein and cannot again be litigated between the parties and their privies, whether or not the claim, demand, purpose, or subject matter of the two actions is the same.[33] (Emphases supplied and citations omitted.) Here, as opposed to the CA's conclusion, all the requisites of res judicata under the concept of \"bar by prior judgment\" and not \"conclusiveness of judgment\" are present. First, it is undisputed that the final decision in CA-G.R. SP No. 04526, as to the validity of the writ of execution was rendered with jurisdiction over the subject matter as well as over the parties, and it was a judgment on the merits. Second, there can be no question as to the identity of the parties in CA-G.R. SP No. 04526 and CA-G.R. SP No. 07675, i.e., Spouses Sacramento and the City Government of Tacloban. Third, the subject matters of the two cases are also identical. The City Government of Tacloban in CA-G.R. SP No. 04526 contested the propriety of enforcing the compromise agreement due to the city council's withdrawal of ratification. Meanwhile, the City Government of Tacloban questioned again the implementation of the agreement on the basis of the previously quashed July 1, 2009 writ of execution. Notably, the quashal of the writ of execution was already reversed, and the RTC's ruling thereon, was the very order assailed in CA-G.R. SP No. 07675. Undoubtedly, the issues in CA-G.R. SP No. 04526 and CA-G.R. SP No. 07675, both concern the satisfaction of the judgment based on the approved compromise agreement.Lastly, the two cases involve similar causes of action. The test to determine whether the causes of action are identical, is to ascertain whether the same evidence will sustain both actions, or whether there is an identity in the facts essential to the maintenance of the two actions. If the same facts or evidence would sustain both, the two actions are considered the same, and a judgment in the first case is a bar to the subsequent action.[34] Verily, the petitions in CA-G.R. SP No. 04526 and CA-G.R. SP No. 07675, have the same underlying objectives, i.e., to prevent the enforcement of the compromise agreement. Also, the City Government of Tacloban presented the same evidence to prove its claims in both cases. The fact that two cases involve different RTC resolutions does not prevent the application of res judicata. Suffice it to say that a party cannot, by varying the form of action or adopting a different method of presenting his case, escape the operation of the principle that one and the same cause of action shall not be twice litigated between the same parties or their privies.[35] Taken together, the petition in CA-G.R. SP No. 07675, is rightfully dismissed for being barred by the prior final judgment in CA-G.R. SP No. 04526.We reiterate that nothing is more settled in law than the doctrine of immutability of judgments. Otherwise, there would be no end to litigation and would set to naught the main role of courts of justice to assist in the enforcement of the rule of law, and the settling of justiciable controversies with finality.[36] It is in the interest of justice that the Court writes finis to this dispute.FOR THESE REASONS, the petition is DENIED.

SACRAMENTO, RESPONDENTS.\n\nR E S O L U T I O N\n\nLOPEZ, M., J.:\n\nThe doctrine of res judicata requires that stability be accorded to judgments lest there would be endless controversies. The relitigation of issues already settled burdens the courts and the taxpayers, creates uneasiness and confusion, and wastes valuable time and energy that could be devoted to worthier causes. [1] We apply this policy in this Petition for Review on Certiorari [2] under Rule 45 of the Rules of Court assailing the Court of Appeals-Cebu City's (CA) Decision [3] dated April 30, 2015 in CA-G.R. S.P. No. 07675.\n\nANTECEDENTS\nSpouses Esteban R. Sacramento and Salvacion Siony L. Sacramento (Spouses Sacramento) owned parcels of land situated in Barangay Sto. Ni\u00f1o, Tacloban City which includes Lot No. 4144. The City Government of Tacloban, with authority from the Sangguniang Panlungsod, filed before the Regional Trial Court (RTC) a complaint for eminent domain over a portion of Lot No. 4144 for use as access road to the city's dumpsite. [4] On September 8, 2008, the parties entered into a Compromise Agreement [5] with the following terms and conditions, to wit:\nNOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing premises, the parties hereby undertake as follows:\n\n(1) The FIRST PARTY shall pay unto the SECOND PARTIES the amount of TWO HUNDRED EIGHTY PESOS ([P]280.00), Philippine Currency, per square meter, as compensation for the acquisition of Lot No. 4144, with an area of about 49,057 sq. meters or a total amount of THIRTEEN MILLION SEVEN HUNDRED THIRTY-FIVE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED SIXTY PESOS ([P]13,735,960.00), Philippine Currency, the lot being the subject of the above-captioned, under the following payment schedule:\n1.1) One-half (1/2) or the amount of SIX MILLION EIGHT HUNDRED SIXTY-SEVEN THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED EIGHTY PESOS ([P]6,867,980.00) to be paid after ratification of this Compromise Agreement by the Sangguniang Panlungsod of Tacloban;\n\n1.2) The other half of SIX MILLION EIGHT HUNDRED SIXTY-SEVEN THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED EIGHTY PESOS ([P]6,867,980.00) shall be paid in two (2) equal installments in the amount of THREE MILLION FOUR HUNDRED THIRTY-THREE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED NINETY PESOS ([P]3,433,990.00) in the succeeding two (2) quarters; (2) The SECOND PARTY shall pay all realty taxes, documentary stamp tax, capital gains tax, sales tax, transfer tax, registration fees, estate tax and other liabilities in connection with the land subject of the above-captioned case and the sale, transfer or conveyance of the same as well as all their obligations and obligations to other parties including those in favor of their lawyer;\n\n(3) The parties agree to, and shall cause, the dismissal, with prejudice, of the above-captioned case, including all claims and counterclaims therein, and agree not to file any similar case, whether civil, administrative or criminal, of any kind or nature whatsoever, arising from the same facts, incident, claim, cause or causes of action;\n\n(4) The parties hereby mutually, irrevocably, freely, and voluntarily release and forever discharge one another, from any and all manner of action, causes of action, sum of money, damages, liability, responsibility, obligation, claims and demands whatsoever in law or equity, which they had, now have, or may have against each other, including, but not limited to, actual, moral, exemplary and all other damages or causes of action provided for under the law if any, arising, directly or indirectly, from the facts and circumstances giving rise to, surrounding or arising from the complaint and/or counterclaims in the Pending Case, all of which claims or causes of action by these presents the parties hereby abandon and waive;\n\n(5) This agreement shall not in any way be construed as an admission on the part of any party of any fault, negligence, or liability, of whatever kind and nature, in connection with the Pending Case;\n\n(6) That the parties hereto agree to declare the FIRST PARTY as the true, legal, and absolute owner of the property subject matter hereof;\n\n(7) In case of material breach of the terms and conditions of this agreement, the innocent party is hereby authorized to apply for a writ of execution in the Pending Case for the purpose of compelling compliance with the terms and conditions of this agreement. [6] (Emphases in the original.) On September 18, 2008, the RTC, presided by Judge Rogelio C. Sescon (Judge Sescon) approved the Compromise Agreement and directed the parties to comply with its terms and conditions. [7] On September 24, 2008, the Sangguniang Panlungsod ratified the agreement through Resolution No. 2008-10-530 stating: \" RESOLVE, as it is hereby resolved, to confirm/ratify the Compromise Agreement entered into by the Parties in Civil Case No. 2006-01-04 and duly approved by Hon. Rogelio C. Sescon, Presiding Judge, RTC Branch 9, Tacloban City dated September 18, 2008 [.]\" [8] On November 19, 2008, however, the Sangguniang Panlungsod withdrew its ratification and issued Resolution No. 2008-10-581 entitled \"RESOLUTION WITHDRAWING/RESCINDING AND/OR REPEALING AND DECLARING AS NULL AND VOID RESOLUTION NO. 2008-10-530 PASSED AND APPROVED BY THIS HONORABLE BODY ON SEPTEMBER 24, 2008.\" [9]\n\nMeantime, Spouses Sacramento moved for the enforcement of the compromise agreement. On March 16, 2009, the RTC denied [10] the motion for execution in view of the withdrawal of the city council's ratification of the compromise agreement, viz. :\nThis Court after going over the allegations of the parties, allegations, and counter-allegations in their subject motion and comments and/or oppositions and finding that the Sangguniang Panlungsod of Tacloban City had passed and approved Resolution No. 2008-10-[581] withdrawing/rescinding and declaring as null and void Resolution No. 2008-10-530 so that there is no more compromise agreement to speak of, finds the defendants' motion for execution of judgment to be devoid of merit, and therefore, this Court denies the same.\n\nSO ORDERED. [11] Spouses Sacramento filed a motion for reconsideration. On June 4, 2009, the RTC granted the motion, [12] and ordered the enforcement of the compromise agreement. On July 1, 2009, a Writ of Execution [13] was issued. Unsuccessful at a reconsideration, [14] the City Government of Tacloban elevated the case to the CA through a Petition for Certiorari [15] docketed as CA-G.R. SP No. 04526. The City Government of Tacloban argued that public funds are not subject to levy and execution, and that the judgment based on a compromise agreement cannot be enforced without a valid ratification from the city council. [16]\n\nOn June 22, 2011, the CA dismissed the petition for certiorari absent grave abuse of discretion on the part of the RTC, [17] thus:\nThe parties' decision to enter into judicial compromise agreements to put an end to litigation is recognized in this jurisdiction. The court cannot impose a judgment different from the terms of a compromise agreement when such concurrence is not contrary to law, judicial decision, morals, good customs, or public policy. Once judicially approved, a compromise agreement becomes more than a binding contract to the parties and has the effect of res judicata . Just like any final judgment, \"the winning party is entitled to a writ of execution and the issuance thereof becomes a court's ministerial duty.\" The Supreme Court has categorically ruled that a judgment upon a compromise is immediately executory, where neither party moved to have it set aside on the ground of vices of consent or forgery.\n\nBefore this Court, petitioner invoked Sangguniang Panglungsod's Resolution No. 2008-10-581 dated 19 November 2008, which rescinded its prior ratification of the subject Compromise Agreement because \"following the passage of [Resolution No. 2008-10-530], Hon. Ranulfo S. Abellanosa discovered that the subject land, Lot 4144, to be acquired from Spouses Esteban and Salvacion Sacramento exceeded greatly in area and price from what was authorized to the city mayor to acquire x x x\" and further cited grounds which make the enforcement of the issued writ of execution invalid due to lack of enabling laws.\n\nUnfortunately for petitioner, it can no longer impugn the validity of the Writ of Execution of 18 September 2008 which was issued out of public respondent's [fulfillment] of a ministerial duty. A final judgment is a vested right, which is protected by law. Certainly, \"a party upon whose initiative an agreement was made, on the basis of which the court rendered judgment, is estopped to question the propriety of the action of the court, in the absence of showing that his consent to the agreement was secured through fraud, which at any rate could not possibly exist, the agreement being of his own making.\" [18] (Emphases supplied and citations omitted.) The CA's decision in CA-G.R. SP No. 04526 lapsed into finality. On February 23, 2012, the CA issued an entry of judgment. Later, Spouses Sacramento moved before the RTC to direct the City Government of Tacloban to comply with the compromise agreement. On June 23, 2011, the RTC granted the motion and issued the corresponding alias writ of execution, and notices of attachment and levy. [19] Undaunted, the City Government of Tacloban moved to quash the writ of execution and to lift the notices of attachment and levy. On October 24, 2011, the RTC granted the motion. [20]\n\nDissatisfied, Spouses Sacramento sought reconsideration but was denied. Thereafter, Judge Sescon inhibited and the case was transferred to Judge Frisco T. Lilagan (Judge Lilagan). Spouses Sacramento, again, moved for the issuance an alias writ of execution. On November 28, 2012, the RTC ruled that an alias writ is no longer necessary and ordered to continue the enforcement of the writ of execution issued on July 1, 2009, [21] to wit:\nFirst: This Court just like the original Court, being merely Regional Trial Courts, cannot modify, defy, violate, or much less reverse the Decision of the Honorable Court of Appeals affirming the validity and legality of the Writ of Execution which the original Court issued. It must be stressed that this Decision of the Court of Appeals had already attained its finality without the said Decision having been appealed.\n\nx x x x\nIt must be remembered that the Decision in this case is by reason of a Compromise Agreement, and a Compromise Agreement once approved by the Court becomes immediately final and executory. The Order approving the Compromise Agreement was issued on September 18, 2008. Legally and technically, therefore, the Writ of Execution issued to enforce the Compromise Agreement is still valid and subsisting. It is in this regard that this Court finds it unnecessary to issue an Alias Writ of Execution, instead to order the herein executing Sheriff, Sheriff IV LUDY C. MARMITA to execute and enforce the said Writ of Execution dated July 1, 2009 already issued and to make a return thereof in accordance with the provisions of the Rules of Court . [22] (Emphasis supplied.) Unsuccessful at a reconsideration, the City Government of Tacloban, again, elevated the case to the CA through a petition for review on certiorari docketed as CA-G.R. SP No. 07675. [23] The City Government of Tacloban posited that Judge Lilagan erred in implementing the writ of execution which a co-equal court had quashed and lifted. [24] On April 30, 2015, the CA dismissed the petition on the ground of res judicata by conclusiveness of judgment, viz :\nThe elements of res judicata under the concept of conclusiveness of judgment are:\nIdentity of parties; and\n\nSubject matter in the first and second cases. The presence of the first element is not disputed considering that the parties in G.R. SP No. 04526 and in this case are similar. Also attendant is the last element, identity of the subject matter or the issue. A perusal of the allegations in the present case evidently shows that the petitioner mentioned issues similarly raised and already resolved in G.R. SP No. 04526. It must be emphasized that the order assailed in the present case is just enforcing the Writ of Execution issued on July 1, 2009 which was already passed upon in G.R. SP No. 04526. [25] Hence, this petition. [26] The City Government of Tacloban insists that the issues in CA-G.R. SP No. 04526 and CA-G.R. SP No. 07675 are different. In CA-G.R. SP No. 04526, the question is whether Judge Sescon committed grave abuse of discretion in enforcing the compromise agreement. On the other hand, the issue in CA-G.R. SP No. 07675 is whether Judge Lilagan was correct in implementing the previously quashed writ of execution dated July 1, 2009. [27]\n\nRULING\nThe petition is unmeritorious.\n\nIt bears emphasis that a compromise agreement is in the nature of both a contract and a judgment on the merits. [28] As a contract, the compromise agreement can only be avoided on grounds of illegality, lack of consent, fraud or duress. [29] In this case, Spouses Sacramento and the City Government of Tacloban freely and voluntarily entered into a compromise agreement. The terms and conditions of the agreement are likewise clear. Moreover, the RTC approved the agreement and the Sangguniang Panlungsod ratified it. The parties knew exactly the rights and duties they assumed. The City Government of Tacloban did not even file any action or motion to set aside the agreement. It is settled that a compromise agreement, once stamped with judicial imprimatur, becomes more than a mere contract and acquires the force and effect of a judgment that is immediately final and executory. [30] As such, the City Government of Tacloban cannot, later, relieve itself of liability simply because the city council changed its position. To be sure, the RTC issued a writ of execution on July 1, 2009, to enforce the agreement as a matter of course. The validity of the writ of execution was settled with finality in CA-G.R. SP No. 04526.\n\nCorollarily, the CA correctly applied the principle of res judicata in dismissing the petition for certiorari in CA-G.R. SP No. 07675. The elements of res judicata are: (1) the judgment sought to bar the new action must be final; (2) the decision must have been rendered by a court having jurisdiction over the subject matter and the parties; (3) the disposition of the case must be a judgment on the merits; and (4) there must be as between the first and second action, identity of parties, subject matter, and causes of action. [31] Apropos is Section (Sec.) 47, Rule 39 of the Rules of Court, to wit:\nSEC. 47. Effect of judgments or final orders. \u2013 The effect of a judgment or final order rendered by a court of the Philippines, having jurisdiction to pronounce the judgment or final order, may be as follows:\nx x x x\n(b) In other cases, the judgment or final order is, with respect to the matter directly adjudged or as to any other matter that could have been raised in relation thereto, conclusive between the parties and their successors in interest by title subsequent to the commencement of the action or special proceeding, litigating for the same thing and under the same title and in the same capacity; and\n\n(c) In any other litigation between the same parties or their successors in interest, that only is deemed to have been adjudged in a former judgment or final order which appears upon its face to have been so adjudged, or which was actually and necessarily included therein or necessary thereto. Based on the above-quoted provision, res judicata is applicable either under the concept of \"bar by prior judgment\" under Sec. 47 (b), Rule 39; or \"conclusiveness of judgment\" under Sec. 47 (c), Rule 39. Case law explained that if there is identity of parties, subject matter, and causes of action in the two cases, then res judicata in its aspect as a \"bar by prior judgment\" would apply. If, as between the two cases, only identity of parties can be shown, but not identical causes of action, then res judicata as \"conclusiveness of judgment\" applies, [32] thus:\nThere is \"bar by prior judgment\" when, as between the first case where the judgment was rendered and the second case that is sought to be barred, there is identity of parties, subject matter, and causes of action. In this instance, the judgment in the first case constitutes an absolute bar to the second action . Otherwise put, the judgment or decree of the court of competent jurisdiction on the merits concludes the litigation between the parties, as well as their privies, and constitutes a bar to a new action or suit involving the same cause of action before the same or any other tribunal.\n\nBut where there is identity of parties in the first and second cases, but no identity of causes of action, the first judgment is conclusive only as to those matters actually and directly controverted and determined and not as to matters merely involved therein. This is the concept of res judicata known as \"conclusiveness of judgment.\" Stated differently, any right, fact or matter in issue directly adjudicated or necessarily involved in the determination of an action before a competent court in which judgment is rendered on the merits is conclusively settled by the judgment therein and cannot again be litigated between the parties and their privies, whether or not the claim, demand, purpose, or subject matter of the two actions is the same. [33] (Emphases supplied and citations omitted.) Here, as opposed to the CA's conclusion, all the requisites of res judicata under the concept of \"bar by prior judgment\" and not \"conclusiveness of judgment \" are present. First , it is undisputed that the final decision in CA-G.R. SP No. 04526, as to the validity of the writ of execution was rendered with jurisdiction over the subject matter as well as over the parties, and it was a judgment on the merits. Second , there can be no question as to the identity of the parties in CA-G.R. SP No. 04526 and CA-G.R. SP No. 07675, i.e. , Spouses Sacramento and the City Government of Tacloban. Third , the subject matters of the two cases are also identical. The City Government of Tacloban in CA-G.R. SP No. 04526 contested the propriety of enforcing the compromise agreement due to the city council's withdrawal of ratification. Meanwhile, the City Government of Tacloban questioned again the implementation of the agreement on the basis of the previously quashed July 1, 2009 writ of execution. Notably, the quashal of the writ of execution was already reversed, and the RTC's ruling thereon, was the very order assailed in CA-G.R. SP No. 07675. Undoubtedly, the issues in CA-G.R. SP No. 04526 and CA-G.R. SP No. 07675, both concern the satisfaction of the judgment based on the approved compromise agreement.\n\nLastly , the two cases involve similar causes of action. The test to determine whether the causes of action are identical, is to ascertain whether the same evidence will sustain both actions, or whether there is an identity in the facts essential to the maintenance of the two actions. If the same facts or evidence would sustain both, the two actions are considered the same, and a judgment in the first case is a bar to the subsequent action. [34] Verily, the petitions in CA-G.R. SP No. 04526 and CA-G.R. SP No. 07675, have the same underlying objectives, i.e. , to prevent the enforcement of the compromise agreement. Also, the City Government of Tacloban presented the same evidence to prove its claims in both cases. The fact that two cases involve different RTC resolutions does not prevent the application of res judicata . Suffice it to say that a party cannot, by varying the form of action or adopting a different method of presenting his case, escape the operation of the principle that one and the same cause of action shall not be twice litigated between the same parties or their privies. [35] Taken together, the petition in CA-G.R. SP No. 07675, is rightfully dismissed for being barred by the prior final judgment in CA-G.R. SP No. 04526.\n\nWe reiterate that nothing is more settled in law than the doctrine of immutability of judgments. Otherwise, there would be no end to litigation and would set to naught the main role of courts of justice to assist in the enforcement of the rule of law, and the settling of justiciable controversies with finality. [36] It is in the interest of justice that the Court writes finis to this dispute.\n\nFOR THESE REASONS, the petition is DENIED. The Court of Appeals' Decision dated April 30, 2015 in CA-G.R. SP No. 07675 is AFFIRMED.\n\nSO ORDERED.\n\nPerlas-Bernabe, SAJ. (Chairperson), Gesmundo, Lazaro-Javier, and Rosario, JJ., concur.\n\n[1] Monterona v. Coca-Cola Bottlers Philippines, Inc., G.R.

BERTENI CATALU\u00d1A CAUSING, RESPONDENT.\n\nD E C I S I O N\n\nLEONEN, SAJ.:\n\nWhile a disbarred lawyer cannot be suspended or disbarred again, these penalties may be formally recorded in case a reinstatement is sought in the future. [1]\n\nThis Court resolves the administrative Complaint [2] filed against Atty. Berteni Catalu\u00f1a Causing (Atty. Causing) for allegedly filing numerous malicious, unfounded, and baseless complaints against Dr. Joyce T. Hidalgo (Dr. Hidalgo), his counsel, and other government officials involved in the demolition of the houses of Atty. Causing's clients. [3] The Commission on Bar Discipline of the Integrated Bar of the Philippines recommended that Atty. Causing be reprimanded. [4] However, the Integrated Bar of the Philippines Board of Governors modified the recommended penalty to a one-year suspension from the practice of law. [5]\n\nOn January 5, 2018, Dr. Hidalgo filed an administrative Complaint [6] against Atty. Causing for violation of the Lawyer's Oath and the Code of Professional Responsibility. [7]\n\nDr. Hidalgo claimed that Atty. Causing deliberately refused to comply with several court decisions which had attained finality. Aside from this, he allegedly filed numerous malicious, unfounded, and baseless complaints against her and other government officials and a disbarment complaint against her counsel. This was supposedly to secure leverage in a pending case and convince them to yield. These cases were ultimately dismissed by the Court of Appeals, the Supreme Court, and the Office of the Ombudsman-Mindanao Station. [8]\n\nFurther, Dr. Hidalgo stated that Atty. Causing charged Hon. Emmanuel Escatron (Judge Escatron), the presiding judge of Branch 2, Regional Trial Court, Butuan City, with allegedly receiving PHP 16,000,000.00 from Dr. Hidalgo in exchange for issuing the Alias Writ of Demolition. Yet, his allegations were made without any evidence. Dr. Hidalgo denied making any payment to Judge Escatron, especially since he already had difficulty paying for the legal services of his counsel. [9]\n\nAs such, Dr. Hidalgo maintained that Atty. Causing violated the Lawyer's Oath and multiple provisions of the Code of Professional Responsibility as he perpetuated falsehood and filed multiple groundless, false, and unlawful suits. [10]\n\nThe following documents were attached to the Complaint to support the allegations: the Court of Appeals' October 27, 2017 Decision in Villar v. Escatron affirming the lower court's issuance of a second Alias Writ of Demolition; [11] the Court's October 8, 2014 Resolution dismissing the petition in Members of Iglesia Ni Cristo v. The Honorable Court of Appeals ; [12] Atty. Causing's complaint-affidavit in Causing v. Amante, Jr. , where Dr. Hidalgo and other government officials were impleaded as respondents; [13] and the Office of the Ombudsman's Joint Order in Amante denying Atty. Causing's motion for reconsideration of the dismissal of his complaint. [14]\n\nIn his Verified Answer with Motion for Leave to Admit Answer, [15] Atty. Causing stated that he had no participation in most of the cases mentioned. He pointed out that the cases were filed by an Atty. Froilan A. Montero. [16] The sole complaint he filed was the one against Dr. Hidalgo for grave misconduct, oppression, and conduct prejudicial to the best interest of the service. This complaint was even supported by the affidavits of the demolition victims. [17]\n\nIn a Resolution, [18] the Commission on Bar Discipline of the Integrated Bar of the Philippines recommended that Atty. Causing be sternly warned and reprimanded for referencing the administrative complaint filed against Judge Escatron for allegedly receiving a bribe of PHP 16,000,000.00 in his Amante complaint-affidavit. As the accusation was based on a mere rumor, wholly unverified, and made without any personal knowledge, Atty. Causing should have refrained from stating it. As such, Atty. Causing was found to have violated the Lawyer's Oath and the Code of Professional Responsibility. [19]\n\nNonetheless, it ruled that the quantum of evidence necessary to link Atty. Causing to Villar and Members of Iglesia Ni Cristo was not met. [20]\n\nOn March 18, 2022, the Integrated Bar of the Philippines Board of Governors issued a Resolution [21] modifying its Report and Recommendation by increasing the recommended penalty to suspension from the practice of law for one year. [22] It took into consideration Atty. Causing's prior suspension by this Court in Administrative Case No. 12883. [23]\n\nAtty. Causing filed his May 27, 2022 Motion for Reconsideration. [24] He clarified that he was not among the complainants in the administrative complaint filed against Judge Escatron, although he entered his appearance as their pro bono lawyer. Prior to filing the case, he ensured the veracity of his clients' allegations that Judge Escatron was involved in bribery. [25]\n\nAs regards Amante , Atty. Causing explained that he was merely stating a fact that an administrative complaint exists involving Judge Escatron's alleged bribery. He did not provide any remark or opinion on this matter. As such, he prayed that the Resolution of Integrated Bar of the Philippines Board of Governors be reversed, and the Complaint against him be dismissed. [26]\n\nThe Commission on Bar Discipline of the Integrated Bar of the Philippines then issued its May 27, 2022 Order. [27] It stated that the filing of a motion for reconsideration was no longer allowed. Nonetheless, the entire records of the case will be forwarded to the Supreme Court. [28]\n\nOn November 15, 2022, Atty. Causing filed a Manifestation [29] before the Court praying that his attached May 27, 2022 Motion for Reconsideration [30] be considered in ruling on his case.\n\nIn its February 22, 2023 Resolution, [31] this Court noted the Integrated Bar of the Philippines Board of Governors' Notice of Resolution No. CBD-XXV-2022-03-39; the copy of Atty. Causing's Motion for Reconsideration; the Integrated Bar of the Philippines' transmittal of the documents pertaining to the case; and Atty. Causing's November 15, 2022 Manifestation.\n\nThe issue for this Court's resolution is whether respondent Atty. Berteni Catalu\u00f1a Causing violated the Code of Professional Responsibility and Accountability.\n\nOn May 30, 2023, the Code of Professional Responsibility and Accountability, which repealed the Code of Professional Responsibility, took effect. [32] The former provides that its provisions \"shall be applied to all pending and future cases, except to the extent that in the opinion of the [Court], its retroactive application would not be feasible or would work injustice, in which case the procedure under which the cases were filed shall govern.\" [33]\n\nThus, although respondent's assailed actions were committed prior the Code of Professional Responsibility and Accountability's effectivity, its provisions shall be applied to determine his administrative liability.\n\nThe following provisions of the Code of Professional Responsibility and Accountability require lawyers to refrain from filing or causing to be filed frivolous or baseless cases against lawyers and government officers, including judges:\nCANON II\nPropriety\nSECTION 13. Imputation of a misconduct, impropriety, or crime without basis . \u2014 A lawyer shall not, directly or indirectly, impute to or accuse another lawyer of a misconduct, impropriety, or a crime in the absence of factual or legal basis.\n\nNeither shall a lawyer, directly or indirectly, file or cause to be filed, or assist in the filing of frivolous or baseless administrative, civil, or criminal complaints against another lawyer.\n\nSECTION 14. Remedy for grievances; insinuation of improper motive . \u2014 A lawyer shall submit grievances against any officer of a court, tribunal, or other government agency only through the appropriate remedy and before the proper authorities.\n\nStatements insinuating improper motive on the part of any such officer, which are not supported by substantial evidence, shall be ground for disciplinary action. While lawyers have the right to \"criticize the acts of courts and judges in respectful terms and through legitimate channels... [this right] is not an unbridled freedom to malign and slander the courts and its officers; and criticisms must be supported by evidence and ventilated in the proper forum.\" [34] As stated in Alpajora v. Calayan : [35]\nAs officers of the court, lawyers are duty-bound to observe and maintain the respect due to the courts and judicial officers. They are to abstain from offensive or menacing language or behavior before the court and must refrain from attributing to a judge motives that are not supported by the record or have no materiality to the case.\n\n. . . .\n\nIt must be remembered that all lawyers are bound to uphold the dignity and authority of the courts, and to promote confidence in the fair administration of justice. It is the respect for the courts that guarantees the stability of the judicial institution; elsewise, the institution would be resting on a very shaky foundation.\n\nHence, no matter how passionate a lawyer is towards defending his client's cause, he must not forget to display the appropriate decorum expected of him, being a member of the legal profession, and to continue to afford proper and utmost respect due to the courts. [36] In Alpajora , a lawyer was suspended for two years for consistently making unsupported imputations in his pleadings that a judge had improper ties with adverse counsels, among others. His act of attributing ill motives to the judge, which were neither supported by the record nor had any materiality to the case, was a violation of Canon 11 of the Code of Professional Responsibility. [37]\n\nRegarding the allegations in the present Complaint, this Court agrees with the Integrated Bar of the Philippines that there is insufficient evidence to show that respondent was involved in Villar and Members of Iglesia Ni Cristo .\n\nThe crux of this case is respondent's statement in his complaint-affidavit regarding Judge Escatron. Respondent stated that the Sinumpaang Reklamo of the 24 residents whose houses were demolished named Judge Escatron as among the errant government officials. However, Judge Escatron was not included in the complaint because a disciplinary case was already filed against him for allegedly accepting a bribe in the amount of PHP 16,000,000.00. The complaint-affidavit states:\n13. These names of the respondents and the contents of the instant complaint are based on twenty-four (24) individual \" Sinumpaang Reklamo \" executed in handwriting by the residents whose homes have been demolished;\n\n14. Copies of these \" Sinumpaang Reklamo \" are hereto attached as follows:\n\n. . . .\n\n15. Actually, these 24 \" Sinumpaang Reklamo \" named Judge Emmanuel E. Escatron and the sheriffs of Butuan RTCs but these court officials are not included in this complaint because they are subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Supreme Court and, besides, a separate complaint was already filed before the Supreme Court against Judge Escatron.\n\n. . . .\n\n39. In the complaint filed before the Supreme Court against Judge Escatron, the complainants alleged that it was rumored that Sixteen Million Pesos (P16,000,000.00) was given to officials to ensure the success of the demolition[.] [38] As Judge Escatron was not a party in Amante , there was no need to make any statement regarding the administrative case, much less state that a member of the Judiciary is facing a bribery charge. That respondent had no personal knowledge of its veracity should have prevented him from charging someone based solely on rumors and hearsay. This is conduct unbecoming of the standards expected from a lawyer with knowledge of legal processes.\n\nFurther, Judge Escatron's administrative case was immaterial to respondent's suit before the Office of the Ombudsman. This too should have caused respondent to stay his hand. Instead, he chose to act in an unethical manner and undermined the integrity of the legal profession. This is not only indicative of a lack of respect for the Judiciary but also reveals his failure to uphold the principles of honesty and fairness\u2014all of which reflect his unfitness to practice law. \"[U]nsubstantiated accusations against judges spurred by ill-motives warrant administrative sanctions.\" [39]\n\nThis Court now determines the proper penalty to be imposed upon respondent. On this note, the Court takes judicial notice of the fact that respondent has been disciplined twice within the last four years and is in fact currently disbarred.\n\nIn Velasco v. Causing , [40] respondent published on his Facebook account a post entitled \"Wise Polygamous Husband?\" and attached photographs of Enrico R. Velasco's (Velasco) petition for declaration of nullity of marriage. Respondent not only shared this post to his other Facebook account and a Facebook group under his name, which had approximately 3,500 members, but also to Velasco's son through direct message. For these acts, this Court suspended respondent from the practice of law for one year with a stern warning that the same or similar acts will be dealt with more severely. [41]\n\nThe administrative case of Lao v. Causing [42] on the other hand, involved respondent's January 18, 2019 posting on his Facebook account of his draft complaint-affidavit for plunder against Jackiya A. Lao (Lao) and other persons. Lao proved that Atty. Causing's post \"elicit[ed] negative reactions, comments and public opinions against Lao and her fellow respondents.\" [43] Lao was \"subjected to public hate, contempt and ridicule, as several people have commented on the said post. The respondents in the complaint for plunder, including Lao, were called several names including ' nangungurakot ' and ' corrupt na official .'\" [44] This Court observed that respondent was motivated by his desire to ruin the reputation of Lao and the others involved in his complaint. Respondent's subsequent filing of the complaint was deemed immaterial as he already succeeded in damaging their reputation. As respondent was a repeat offender, this Court disbarred him from the practice of law:\nHere, the Court takes note of the fact that Atty. Causing had just recently served his one-year suspension pursuant to the ruling in the Velasco case, which was promulgated on March 2, 2021. We likewise note that the acts complained of therein occurred in April 2016 and the corresponding disbarment complaint was filed thereafter. The filing of the disbarment complaint against Atty. Causing in the Velasco case should have served as a deterrent. However, it appears that the same had no effect. Thus, the penalty of disbarment is warranted [45] Respondent's pattern of misconduct reveals a gross disregard for ethical standards. His inclusion of unsubstantiated accusations not only damaged Judge Escatron's reputation as a member of the bench but eroded the public's confidence in the courts and their integrity in administering justice. This is anathema to respondent's duty as an officer of the court to uphold honesty and respect for the Judiciary.\n\nDespite respondent's disbarment, this Court may still prescribe the proper penalty commensurate to his violation for record purposes. Canon VI, Section 42 of the Code of Professional Responsibility and Accountability reads:\nSECTION 42. Penalty when the respondent has been previously disbarred. \u2014 When the respondent has been previously disbarred and is subsequently found guilty of a new charge, the Court may impose a fine or order the disbarred lawyer to return the money or property to the client, when proper. If the new charge deserves the penalty of a disbarment or suspension from the practice of law, it shall not be imposed but the penalty shall be recorded in the personal file of the disbarred lawyer in the Office of the Bar Confidant or other office designated for the purpose. In the event that the disbarred lawyer applies for judicial clemency, the penalty so recorded shall be considered in the resolution of the same. Recording the new ethical violation in an already-disbarred lawyer's official file maintained by the Office of the Bar Confidant serves a vital function. Should the disbarred lawyer ever apply for reinstatement, this documented history of ethical violations would weigh heavily in the decision, making reinstatement more difficult to obtain. [46]\n\nAs such, this Court finds that respondent exhibited grossly undignified conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice, which is a serious offense under Section 33(i) of the Code of Professional Responsibility and Accountability. Under Canon VI, Section 37 thereof, this Court may impose the following sanctions for serious offenses: \"(1) [d]isbarment; (2) [s]uspension from the practice of law for a period exceeding six (6) months; (3) [r]evocation of notarial commission and disqualification as notary public for not less than two (2) years; or (4) [a] fine exceeding [PHP] 100,000.00.\" [47]\n\nFurther, Canon VI, Sections 38 and 39 of the Code of Professional Responsibility and Accountability holds that a respondent's previous administrative liability is an aggravating circumstance that may warrant the imposition of the penalty of disbarment. [48]\n\nGiven the above considerations, this Court finds that the imposition of the ultimate penalty of disbarment upon respondent is proper. There is no question that respondent has the propensity for disregarding the provisions of the Code of Professional Responsibility and Accountability and violating his oath as a lawyer: \"Membership in the legal profession is a privilege, and whenever it is made to appear that an attorney is no longer worthy of the trust and confidence of his clients and the public, it becomes not only the right but also the duty of the Court to withdraw the same.\" [49] As held in PHILCOMSAT Holdings Corporation v. Atty. Lokin, Jr. : [50]\nIt must be reiterated that as an officer of the court, it is a lawyer's sworn and moral duty to help build and not destroy unnecessarily that high esteem and regard towards the courts so essential to the proper administration of justice; as acts and/or omissions emanating from lawyers which tend to undermine the judicial edifice is disastrous to the continuity of the government and to the attainment of the liberties of the people. Thus, all lawyers should be bound not only to safeguard the good name of the legal profession, but also to keep inviolable the honor, prestige, and reputation of the judiciary. [51] (Citation omitted) ACCORDINGLY , the Court finds respondent Atty. Berteni Catalu\u00f1a Causing GUILTY of conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice and sentences him to DISBARMENT from the practice of law. However, in view of his existing disbarment, the present penalty of disbarment can no longer be imposed, but should nonetheless be considered should he apply for reinstatement.\n\nLet a copy of this Decision be furnished to the Office of the Bar Confidant, to be entered into Atty. Berteni Catalu\u00f1a Causing's records. Copies shall likewise be furnished to the Integrated Bar of the Philippines and the Office of the Court Administrator for circulation to all courts concerned.\n\nSO ORDERED.\n\nGesmundo, C.J., Caguioa, Hernando, Lazaro-Javier, Inting, Zalameda, M.
